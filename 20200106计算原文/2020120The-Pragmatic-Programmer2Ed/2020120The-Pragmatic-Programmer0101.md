# 0101. A Pragmatic Philosophy

This book is about you.

Make no mistake, it is your career, and more importantly, Topic 1, It’s Your Life. You own it. You’re here because you know you can become a better developer and help others become better as well. You can become a Pragmatic Programmer.

What distinguishes Pragmatic Programmers? We feel it’s an

attitude, a style, a philosophy of approaching problems and

their solutions. They think beyond the immediate problem,

placing it in its larger context and seeking out the bigger picture.

After all, without this larger context, how can you be pragmatic?

How can you make intelligent compromises and informed

decisions?

Another key to their success is that Pragmatic Programmers

take responsibility for everything they do, which we discuss in Topic 2, The Cat Ate My Source Code. Being responsible, Pragmatic Programmers won’t sit idly by and watch their

projects fall apart through neglect. In Topic 3, Software

Entropy, we tell you how to keep your projects pristine.

Most people find change difficult, sometimes for good reasons,

sometimes because of plain old inertia. In Topic 4, Stone Soup

and Boiled Frogs, we look at a strategy for instigating change

and (in the interests of balance) present the cautionary tale of an amphibian that ignored the dangers of gradual change.

One of the benefits of understanding the context in which you work is that it becomes easier to know just how good your

software has to be. Sometimes near-perfection is the only

option, but often there are trade-offs involved. We explore this in Topic 5, Good-Enough Software.

Of course, you need to have a broad base of knowledge and

experience to pull all of this off. Learning is a continuous and ongoing process. In Topic 6, Your Knowledge Portfolio, we discuss some strategies for keeping the momentum up.

Finally, none of us works in a vacuum. We all spend a large

amount of time interacting with others. Topic 7, Communicate!

lists ways we can do this better.

Pragmatic programming stems from a philosophy of pragmatic

thinking. This chapter sets the basis for that philosophy.

Topic 1

want to move to Asia, or Europe, or work from home.

And the answer we give is always the same.

「Why can’t you change it?」

Software development must appear close to the top of any list of careers where you have control. Our skills are in demand, our knowledge crosses geographic boundaries, we can work

remotely. We’re paid well. We really can do just about anything we want.

But, for some reason, developers seem to resist change. They hunker down, and hope things will get better. They look on,

passively, as their skills become dated and complain that their companies don’t train them. They look at ads for exotic

locations on the bus, then step off into the chilling rain and

trudge into work.

So here’s the most important tip in the book.

Tip 3

You Have Agency

Does your work environment suck? Is your job boring? Try to

fix it. But don’t try forever. As Martin Fowler says,「you can change your organization or change your organization.」[3]

If technology seems to be passing you by, make time (in your own time) to study new stuff that looks interesting. You’re

investing in yourself, so doing it while you’re off-the-clock is only reasonable.

Want to work remotely? Have you asked? If they say no, then

find someone who says yes.

This industry gives you a remarkable set of opportunities. Be proactive, and take them.

Holy Writ, 1709

Programmers take charge of their

own career, and aren’t afraid to

admit ignorance or error. It’s not the most pleasant aspect of programming, to be sure, but it will happen—even on the best of projects. Despite thorough testing, good documentation, and

solid automation, things go wrong. Deliveries are late.

Unforeseen technical problems come up.

These things happen, and we try to deal with them as

professionally as we can. This means being honest and direct.

We can be proud of our abilities, but we must own up to our

shortcomings—our ignorance and our mistakes.

TEAM TRUST

Above all, your team needs to be able to trust and rely on you—

and you need to be comfortable relying on each of them as well.

Trust in a team is absolutely essential for creativity and

collaboration according to the research literature.[4 ]In a healthy environment based in trust, you can safely speak your mind,

present your ideas, and rely on your team members who can in

turn rely on you. Without trust, well…

Imagine a high-tech, stealth ninja team infiltrating the villain’s evil lair. After months of planning and delicate execution, you’ve made it on site. Now it’s your turn to set up the laser guidance grid:「Sorry, folks, I don’t have the laser. The cat was playing with the red dot and I left it at home.」

That sort of breach of trust might be hard to repair.

TAKE RESPONSIBILITY

Responsibility is something you actively agree to. You make a commitment to ensure that something is done right, but you

don’t necessarily have direct control over every aspect of it. In addition to doing your own personal best, you must analyze the situation for risks that are beyond your control. You have the right not to take on a responsibility for an impossible situation, or one in which the risks are too great, or the ethical

implications too sketchy. You’ll have to make the call based on your own values and judgment.

When you do accept the responsibility for an outcome, you should expect to be held accountable for it. When you make a mistake (as we all do) or an error in judgment, admit it honestly and try to offer options.

Don’t blame someone or something else, or make up an excuse.

Don’t blame all the problems on a vendor, a programming

language, management, or your coworkers. Any and all of these may play a role, but it is up to you to provide solutions, not excuses.

If there was a risk that the vendor wouldn’t come through for

you, then you should have had a contingency plan. If your mass storage melts—taking all of your source code with it—and you don’t have a backup, it’s your fault. Telling your boss「the cat ate my source code’’ just won’t cut it.

Tip 4

Provide Options, Don’t Make Lame Excuses

Before you approach anyone to tell them why something can’t

be done, is late, or is broken, stop and listen to yourself. Talk to the rubber duck on your monitor, or the cat. Does your excuse sound reasonable, or stupid? How’s it going to sound to your boss?

Run through the conversation in your mind. What is the other person likely to say? Will they ask,「Have you tried this…」or

「Didn’t you consider that?」How will you respond? Before you go and tell them the bad news, is there anything else you can try? Sometimes, you just know what they are going to say, so save them the trouble.

Instead of excuses, provide options. Don’t say it can’t be done; explain what can be done to salvage the situation. Does code have to be deleted? Tell them so, and explain the value of

refactoring (see Topic 40, Refactoring).

Do you need to spend time prototyping to determine the best

way to proceed (see Topic 13, Prototypes and Post-it Notes)? Do you need to introduce better testing (see Topic 41, Test to Code,

and Ruthless and Continuous Testing) or automation to prevent it from happening again?

Perhaps you need additional resources to complete this task. Or

maybe you need to spend more time with the users? Or maybe it’s just you: do you need to learn some technique or technology in greater depth? Would a book or a course help? Don’t be

afraid to ask, or to admit that you need help.

Try to flush out the lame excuses before voicing them aloud. If you must, tell your cat first. After all, if little Tiddles is going to take the blame….

CHALLENGES

How do you react when someone—such as a bank teller, an auto mechanic, or a clerk—comes to you with a lame excuse? What do you think of them and their company as a result?

When you find yourself saying,「I don’t know,」be sure to follow it up with「—but I’ll find out.」It’s a great way to admit what you don’t know, but then take responsibility like a pro.

Topic 3

Software Entropy

While software development is immune from almost all physical laws, the inexorable increase in entropy hits us hard. Entropy is a term from physics that refers to the amount of「disorder」in a system. Unfortunately, the laws of thermodynamics guarantee

that the entropy in the universe tends toward a maximum.

When disorder increases in software, we call it「software rot.」

Some folks might call it by the more optimistic term,「technical debt,」with the implied notion that they’ll pay it back someday.

They probably won’t.

Whatever the name, though, both debt and rot can spread

uncontrollably.

There are many factors that can contribute to software rot. The most important one seems to be the psychology, or culture, at work on a project. Even if you are a team of one, your project’s psychology can be a very delicate thing. Despite the best-laid plans and the best people, a project can still experience ruin and decay during its lifetime. Yet there are other projects that, despite enormous difficulties and constant setbacks,

successfully fight nature’s tendency toward disorder and

manage to come out pretty well.

What makes the difference?

In inner cities, some buildings are beautiful and clean, while others are rotting hulks. Why? Researchers in the field of crime

and urban decay discovered a fascinating trigger mechanism, one that very quickly turns a clean, intact, inhabited building into a smashed and abandoned derelict. [5]

A broken window.

One broken window, left unrepaired for any substantial length of time, instills in the inhabitants of the building a sense of abandonment—a sense that the powers that be don’t care about the building. So another window gets broken. People start

littering. Graffiti appears. Serious structural damage begins. In a relatively short span of time, the building becomes damaged beyond the owner’s desire to fix it, and the sense of

abandonment becomes reality.

Why would that make a difference? Psychologists have done

studies[6 ]that show hopelessness can be contagious. Think of the flu virus in close quarters. Ignoring a clearly broken

situation reinforces the ideas that perhaps nothing can be fixed, that no one cares, all is doomed; all negative thoughts which can spread among team members, creating a vicious spiral.

Tip 5

Don’t Live with Broken Windows

Don’t leave「broken windows’’ (bad designs, wrong decisions, or poor code) unrepaired. Fix each one as soon as it is discovered.

If there is insufficient time to fix it properly, then board it up.

Perhaps you can comment out the offending code, or display a

「Not Implemented」message, or substitute dummy data instead.

Take some action to prevent further damage and to show that you’re on top of the situation.

We’ve seen clean, functional systems deteriorate pretty quickly once windows start breaking. There are other factors that can contribute to software rot, and we’ll touch on some of them

elsewhere, but neglect accelerates the rot faster than any other factor.

You may be thinking that no one has the time to go around

cleaning up all the broken glass of a project. If so, then you’d better plan on getting a dumpster, or moving to another

neighborhood. Don’t let entropy win.

FIRST, DO NO HARM

Andy once had an acquaintance who was obscenely rich. His

house was immaculate, loaded with priceless antiques, objets d’art, and so on. One day, a tapestry that was hanging a little too close to a fireplace caught on fire. The fire department rushed in to save the day—and his house. But before they dragged their big, dirty hoses into the house, they stopped—with the fire

raging—to roll out a mat between the front door and the source of the fire.

They didn’t want to mess up the carpet.

Now that sounds pretty extreme. Surely the fire department’s first priority is to put out the fire, collateral damage be damned.

But they clearly had assessed the situation, were confident of their ability to manage the fire, and were careful not to inflict unnecessary damage to the property. That’s the way it must be with software: don’t cause collateral damage just because there’s a crisis of some sort. One broken window is one too many.

One broken window—a badly designed piece of code, a poor

management decision that the team must live with for the

duration of the project—is all it takes to start the decline. If you find yourself working on a project with quite a few broken

windows, it’s all too easy to slip into the mindset of「All the rest of this code is crap, I’ll just follow suit.」It doesn’t matter if the project has been fine up to this point. In the original experiment leading to the「Broken Window Theory,」an abandoned car sat

for a week untouched. But once a single window was broken, the car was stripped and turned upside down within hours.

By the same token, if you find yourself on a project where the code is pristinely beautiful—cleanly written, well designed, and elegant—you will likely take extra special care not to mess it up, just like the firefighters. Even if there’s a fire raging (deadline, release date, trade show demo, etc.), you don’t want to be the first one to make a mess and inflict additional damage.

Just tell yourself,「No broken windows.」

Help strengthen your team by surveying your project

Can you tell when a window first gets broken? What is your

reaction? If it was the result of someone else’s decision, or a management edict, what can you do about it?

Topic 4

Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs

The three soldiers returning home from war were hungry.

When they saw the village ahead their spirits lifted—they were sure the villagers would give them a meal. But when they got there, they found the doors locked and the windows closed.

After many years of war, the villagers were short of food, and hoarded what they had.

Undeterred, the soldiers boiled a pot of water and carefully placed three stones into it. The amazed villagers came out to watch.

「This is stone soup,」the soldiers explained.「Is that all you put in it?」asked the villagers.「Absolutely—although some say it tastes even better with a few carrots…」A villager ran off, returning in no time with a basket of carrots from his hoard.

A couple of minutes later, the villagers again asked「Is that it?」

「Well,」said the soldiers,「a couple of potatoes give it body.」Off ran another villager.

Over the next hour, the soldiers listed more ingredients that would enhance the soup: beef, leeks, salt, and herbs. Each time a different villager would run off to raid their personal stores.

Eventually they had produced a large pot of steaming soup.

The soldiers removed the stones, and they sat down with the entire village to enjoy the first square meal any of them had

eaten in months.

There are a couple of morals in the stone soup story. The

villagers are tricked by the soldiers, who use the villagers’

curiosity to get food from them. But more importantly, the

soldiers act as a catalyst, bringing the village together so they can jointly produce something that they couldn’t have done by themselves—a synergistic result. Eventually everyone wins.

Every now and then, you might want to emulate the soldiers.

You may be in a situation where you know exactly what needs

doing and how to do it. The entire system just appears before your eyes—you know it’s right. But ask permission to tackle the whole thing and you’ll be met with delays and blank stares.

People will form committees, budgets will need approval, and things will get complicated. Everyone will guard their own

resources. Sometimes this is called「start-up fatigue.’’

It’s time to bring out the stones. Work out what you can reasonably ask for. Develop it well. Once you’ve got it, show people, and let them marvel. Then say「of course, it would be better if we added…’’ Pretend it’s not important. Sit back and wait for them to start asking you to add the functionality you originally wanted. People find it easier to join an ongoing

success. Show them a glimpse of the future and you’ll get them to rally around.[7]

Tip 6

Be a Catalyst for Change

THE VILLAGERS’ SIDE

On the other hand, the stone soup story is also about gentle and

gradual deception. It’s about focusing too tightly. The villagers think about the stones and forget about the rest of the world.

We all fall for it, every day. Things just creep up on us.

We’ve all seen the symptoms. Projects slowly and inexorably get totally out of hand. Most software disasters start out too small to notice, and most project overruns happen a day at a time.

Systems drift from their specifications feature by feature, while patch after patch gets added to a piece of code until there’s nothing of the original left. It’s often the accumulation of small things that breaks morale and teams.

Tip 7

Remember the Big Picture

We’ve never tried this—honest. But「they」say that if you take a frog and drop it into boiling water, it will jump straight back out again. However, if you place the frog in a pan of cold water, then gradually heat it, the frog won’t notice the slow increase in temperature and will stay put until cooked.

Note that the frog’s problem is different from the broken

windows issue discussed in Topic 3, Software Entropy. In the Broken Window Theory, people lose the will to fight entropy

because they perceive that no one else cares. The frog just

doesn’t notice the change.

Don’t be like the fabled frog. Keep an eye on the big picture.

Constantly review what’s happening around you, not just what you personally are doing.

Topic 38, Programming by Coincidence

CHALLENGES

While reviewing a draft of the first edition, John Lakos raised the following issue: The soldiers progressively deceive the villagers, but the change they catalyze does them all good. However, by

progressively deceiving the frog, you’re doing it harm. Can you determine whether you’re making stone soup or frog soup when you try to catalyze change? Is the decision subjective or objective?

Quick, without looking, how many lights are in the ceiling above you? How many exits in the room? How many people? Is there

anything out of context, anything that looks like it doesn’t belong?

This is an exercise in situational awareness, a technique practiced by folks ranging from Boy and Girl Scouts to Navy SEALs. Get in the habit of really looking and noticing your surroundings. Then do the same for your project.

Topic 5

Good-Enough Software

There’s an old(ish) joke about a

company that places an order for

Striving to better, oft

100,000 ICs with a Japanese

we mar what’s well.

manufacturer. Part of the

specification was the defect rate:

Shakespeare, King Lear 1.4

one chip in 10,000. A few weeks

later the order arrived: one large

box containing thousands of ICs, and a small one containing

just ten. Attached to the small box was a label that read:「These are the faulty ones.’’

If only we really had this kind of control over quality. But the real world just won’t let us produce much that’s truly perfect, particularly not bug-free software. Time, technology, and

temperament all conspire against us.

However, this doesn’t have to be frustrating. As Ed Yourdon

described in an article in IEEE Software, When good-enough

software is best [You95], you can discipline yourself to write

software that’s good enough—good enough for your users, for

future maintainers, for your own peace of mind. You’ll find that you are more productive and your users are happier. And you

may well find that your programs are actually better for their shorter incubation.

Before we go any further, we need to qualify what we’re about to say. The phrase「good enough’’ does not imply sloppy or poorly

produced code. All systems must meet their users’ requirements to be successful, and meet basic performance, privacy, and

security standards. We are simply advocating that users be

given an opportunity to participate in the process of deciding when what you’ve produced is good enough for their needs.

INVOLVE YOUR USERS IN THE TRADE-OFF

Normally you’re writing software for other people. Often you’ll remember to find out what they want.[8] But do you ever ask them how good they want their software to be? Sometimes there’ll be no choice. If you’re working on pacemakers, an

autopilot, or a low-level library that will be widely disseminated, the requirements will be more stringent and your options more limited.

However, if you’re working on a brand-new product, you’ll have different constraints. The marketing people will have promises to keep, the eventual end users may have made plans based on a delivery schedule, and your company will certainly have cash-flow constraints. It would be unprofessional to ignore these users’ requirements simply to add new features to the program, or to polish up the code just one more time. We’re not

advocating panic: it is equally unprofessional to promise

impossible time scales and to cut basic engineering corners to meet a deadline.

The scope and quality of the system you produce should be

discussed as part of that system’s requirements.

Tip 8

Make Quality a Requirements Issue

Often you’ll be in situations where trade-offs are involved.

Surprisingly, many users would rather use software with some rough edges today than wait a year for the shiny, bells-and-whistles version (and in fact what they will need a year from now may be completely different anyway). Many IT

departments with tight budgets would agree. Great software

today is often preferable to the fantasy of perfect software tomorrow. If you give your users something to play with early, their feedback will often lead you to a better eventual solution (see Topic 12, Tracer Bullets).

KNOW WHEN TO STOP

In some ways, programming is like painting. You start with a blank canvas and certain basic raw materials. You use a

combination of science, art, and craft to determine what to do with them. You sketch out an overall shape, paint the

underlying environment, then fill in the details. You constantly step back with a critical eye to view what you’ve done. Every now and then you’ll throw a canvas away and start again.

But artists will tell you that all the hard work is ruined if you don’t know when to stop. If you add layer upon layer, detail over detail, the painting becomes lost in the paint.

Don’t spoil a perfectly good program by overembellishment and overrefinement. Move on, and let your code stand in its own

right for a while. It may not be perfect. Don’t worry: it could never be perfect. (In Chapter 7, While You Are Coding, we’ll discuss philosophies for developing code in an imperfect world.) RELATED SECTIONS INCLUDE

Topic 45, The Requirements Pit

Topic 46, Solving Impossible Puzzles

CHALLENGES

Look at the software tools and operating systems that you use regularly. Can you find any evidence that these organizations and/or developers are comfortable shipping software they know is not perfect? As a user, would you rather (1) wait for them to get all the bugs out, (2) have complex software and accept some bugs, or (3) opt for simpler software with fewer defects?

Consider the effect of modularization on the delivery of software.

Will it take more or less time to get a tightly coupled monolithic block of software to the required quality compared with a system designed as very loosely coupled modules or microservices? What are the advantages or disadvantages of each approach?

Can you think of popular software that suffers from feature bloat?

That is, software containing far more features than you would ever use, each feature introducing more opportunity for bugs and

security vulnerabilities, and making the features you do use harder to find and manage. Are you in danger of falling into this trap yourself?

Benjamin Franklin

happens to the early worm?

In this case, though, Ben really hit

the nail on the head. Your knowledge and experience are your most important day-to-day professional assets.

Unfortunately, they’re expiring assets. [9] Your knowledge becomes out of date as new techniques, languages, and

environments are developed. Changing market forces may

render your experience obsolete or irrelevant. Given the ever-increasing pace of change in our technological society, this can happen pretty quickly.

As the value of your knowledge declines, so does your value to your company or client. We want to prevent this from ever

happening.

Your ability to learn new things is your most important strategic asset. But how do you learn how to learn, and how do you know what to learn?

YOUR KNOWLEDGE PORTFOLIO

We like to think of all the facts programmers know about computing, the application domains they work in, and all their experience as their knowledge portfolios. Managing a knowledge portfolio is very similar to managing a financial

portfolio:

1. Serious investors invest regularly—as a habit.

2. Diversification is the key to long-term success.

3. Smart investors balance their portfolios between conservative and high-risk, high-reward investments.

4. Investors try to buy low and sell high for maximum return.

5. Portfolios should be reviewed and rebalanced periodically.

To be successful in your career, you must invest in your

knowledge portfolio using these same guidelines.

The good news is that managing this kind of investment is a

skill just like any other—it can be learned. The trick is to make yourself do it initially and form a habit. Develop a routine which you follow until your brain internalizes it. At that point, you’ll find yourself sucking up new knowledge automatically.

BUILDING YOUR PORTFOLIO

Invest regularly

Just as in financial investing, you must invest in your

knowledge portfolio regularly, even if it’s just a small amount. The habit is as important as the sums, so plan to

use a consistent time and place, away from interruptions.

A few sample goals are listed in the next section.

Diversify

The more different things you know, the more valuable

you are. As a baseline, you need to know the ins and outs of the particular technology you are working with

currently. But don’t stop there. The face of computing

changes rapidly—hot technology today may well be close

to useless (or at least not in demand) tomorrow. The

more technologies you are comfortable with, the better

you will be able to adjust to change. And don’t forget all

the other skills you need, including those in non-

technical areas.

Manage risk

Technology exists along a spectrum from risky,

potentially high-reward to low-risk, low-reward

standards. It’s not a good idea to invest all of your money

in high-risk stocks that might collapse suddenly, nor

should you invest all of it conservatively and miss out on

possible opportunities. Don’t put all your technical eggs

in one basket.

Buy low, sell high

Learning an emerging technology before it becomes

popular can be just as hard as finding an undervalued

stock, but the payoff can be just as rewarding. Learning

Java back when it was first introduced and unknown may

have been risky at the time, but it paid off handsomely for

the early adopters when it became an industry mainstay

later.

Review and rebalance

This is a very dynamic industry. That hot technology you

started investigating last month might be stone cold by

now. Maybe you need to brush up on that database

technology that you haven’t used in a while. Or perhaps

you could be better positioned for that new job opening if you tried out that other language….

Of all these guidelines, the most important one is the simplest to do:

Tip 9

Invest Regularly in Your Knowledge Portfolio

GOALS

Now that you have some guidelines on what and when to add to your knowledge portfolio, what’s the best way to go about

acquiring intellectual capital with which to fund your portfolio?

Here are a few suggestions:

Learn at least one new language every year

Different languages solve the same problems in different

ways. By learning several different approaches, you can

help broaden your thinking and avoid getting stuck in a

rut. Additionally, learning many languages is easy thanks

to the wealth of freely available software.

Read a technical book each month

While there’s a glut of short-form essays and occasionally

reliable answers on the web, for deep understanding you

need long-form books. Browse the booksellers for

technical books on interesting topics related to your

current project. [10 ]Once you’re in the habit, read a book a month. After you’ve mastered the technologies you’re

currently using, branch out and study some that don’t

relate to your project.

Read nontechnical books, too

It is important to remember that computers are used by people—people whose needs you are trying to satisfy. You work with people, are employed by people, and get

hacked by people. Don’t forget the human side of the

equation, as that requires an entirely different skill set

(we ironically call these soft skills, but they are actually quite hard to master).

Take classes

Look for interesting courses at a local or online college or university, or perhaps at the next nearby trade show or

conference.

Participate in local user groups and meetups

Isolation can be deadly to your career; find out what

people are working on outside of your company. Don’t

just go and listen: actively participate.

Experiment with different environments

If you’ve worked only in Windows, spend some time with

Linux. If you’ve used only makefiles and an editor, try a

sophisticated IDE with cutting-edge features, and vice

versa.

Stay current

Read news and posts online on technology different from

that of your current project. It’s a great way to find out

what experiences other people are having with it, the

particular jargon they use, and so on.

It’s important to continue investing. Once you feel comfortable with some new language or bit of technology, move on. Learn

another one.

It doesn’t matter whether you ever use any of these technologies on a project, or even whether you put them on your resume. The process of learning will expand your thinking, opening you to new possibilities and new ways of doing things. The cross-pollination of ideas is important; try to apply the lessons you’ve learned to your current project. Even if your project doesn’t use that technology, perhaps you can borrow some ideas. Get

familiar with object orientation, for instance, and you’ll write procedural programs differently. Understand the functional

programming paradigm and you’ll write object-oriented code

differently, and so on.

OPPORTUNITIES FOR LEARNING

So you’re reading voraciously, you’re on top of all the latest breaking developments in your field (not an easy thing to do), and somebody asks you a question. You don’t have the faintest idea what the answer is, and freely admit as much.

Don’t let it stop there. Take it as a personal challenge to find the answer. Ask around. Search the web—the scholarly parts too,

not just the consumer parts.

If you can’t find the answer yourself, find out who can. Don’t let it rest. Talking to other people will help build your personal network, and you may surprise yourself by finding solutions to other, unrelated problems along the way. And that old portfolio just keeps getting bigger….

All of this reading and researching takes time, and time is

already in short supply. So you need to plan ahead. Always have something to read in an otherwise dead moment. Time spent

waiting for doctors and dentists can be a great opportunity to catch up on your reading—but be sure to bring your own e-

reader with you, or you might find yourself thumbing through a dog-eared 1973 article about Papua New Guinea.

CRITICAL THINKING

The last important point is to think critically about what you read and hear. You need to ensure that the knowledge in your portfolio is accurate and unswayed by either vendor or media hype. Beware of the zealots who insist that their dogma provides the only answer—it may or may not be applicable to you and your project.

Never underestimate the power of commercialism. Just because a web search engine lists a hit first doesn’t mean that it’s the best match; the content provider can pay to get top billing. Just because a bookstore features a book prominently doesn’t mean it’s a good book, or even popular; they may have been paid to place it there.

Tip 10

Critically Analyze What You Read and Hear

Critical thinking is an entire discipline unto itself, and we encourage you to read and study all you can about it. In the meantime, here’s a head start with a few questions to ask and think about.

Ask the「Five Whys」

A favorite consulting trick: ask「why?」at least five times.

Ask a question, and get an answer. Dig deeper by asking

「why?」Repeat as if you were a petulant four-year old

(but a polite one). You might be able to get closer to a

root cause this way.

Who does this benefit?

It may sound cynical, but follow the money can be a very helpful path to analyze. The benefits to someone else or

another organization may be aligned with your own, or

not.

What’s the context?

Everything occurs in its own context, which is why「one

size fits all」solutions often don’t. Consider an article or book touting a「best practice.」Good questions to

consider are「best for who?」What are the prerequisites,

what are the consequences, short and long term?

When or Where would this work?

Under what circumstances? Is it too late? Too early?

Don’t stop with first-order thinking ( what will happen

next), but use second-order thinking: what will happen after that?

Why is this a problem?

Is there an underlying model? How does the underlying

model work?

Unfortunately, there are very few simple answers anymore. But with your extensive portfolio, and by applying some critical analysis to the torrent of technical articles you will read, you can understand the complex answers.

CHALLENGES

Start learning a new language this week. Always programmed in the same old language? Try Clojure, Elixir, Elm, F#, Go, Haskell, Python, R, ReasonML, Ruby, Rust, Scala, Swift, TypeScript, or anything else that appeals and/or looks as if you might like it. [11]

Start reading a new book (but finish this one first!). If you are doing very detailed implementation and coding, read a book on design and architecture. If you are doing high-level design, read a book on coding techniques.

Get out and talk technology with people who aren’t involved in your current project, or who don’t work for the same company. Network in your company cafeteria, or maybe seek out fellow enthusiasts at a local meetup.

people. A good idea is an orphan

without effective communication.

As developers, we have to communicate on many levels. We

spend hours in meetings, listening and talking. We work with end users, trying to understand their needs. We write code,

which communicates our intentions to a machine and

documents our thinking for future generations of developers.

We write proposals and memos requesting and justifying

resources, reporting our status, and suggesting new approaches.

And we work daily within our teams to advocate our ideas,

modify existing practices, and suggest new ones. A large part of our day is spent communicating, so we need to do it well.

Treat English (or whatever your native tongue may be) as just another programming language. Write natural language as you

would write code: honor the DRY principle, ETC, automation,

and so on. (We discuss the DRY and ETC design principles in

the next chapter.)

Tip 11

English is Just Another Programming Language

We’ve put together a list of additional ideas that we find useful.

KNOW YOUR AUDIENCE

You’re communicating only if you’re conveying what you mean

to convey—just talking isn’t enough. To do that, you need to understand the needs, interests, and capabilities of your

audience. We’ve all sat in meetings where a development geek glazes over the eyes of the vice president of marketing with a long monologue on the merits of some arcane technology. This isn’t communicating: it’s just talking, and it’s annoying.[12]

Say you want to change your remote monitoring system to use a third-party message broker to disseminate status notifications.

You can present this update in many different ways, depending on your audience. End users will appreciate that their systems can now interoperate with other services that use the broker.

Your marketing department will be able to use this fact to boost sales. Development and operations managers will be happy

because the care and maintenance of that part of the system is now someone else’s problem. Finally, developers may enjoy

getting experience with new APIs, and may even be able to find new uses for the message broker. By making the appropriate

pitch to each group, you’ll get them all excited about your

project.

As with all forms of communication, the trick here is to gather feedback. Don’t just wait for questions: ask for them. Look at body language, and facial expressions. One of the Neuro

Linguistic Programming presuppositions is「The meaning of

your communication is the response you get.」Continuously

improve your knowledge of your audience as you communicate.

KNOW WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY

Probably the most difficult part of the more formal styles of communication used in business is working out exactly what it is you want to say. Fiction writers often plot out their books in detail before they start, but people writing technical documents are often happy to sit down at a keyboard, enter:

1. Introduction

and start typing whatever comes into their heads next.

Plan what you want to say. Write an outline. Then ask yourself,

「Does this communicate what I want to express to my audience in a way that works for them?」Refine it until it does.

This approach works for more than just documents. When

you’re faced with an important meeting or a chat with a major client, jot down the ideas you want to communicate, and plan a couple of strategies for getting them across.

Now that you know what your audience wants, let’s deliver it.

CHOOSE YOUR MOMENT

It’s six o’clock on Friday afternoon, following a week when the auditors have been in. Your boss’s youngest is in the hospital, it’s pouring rain outside, and the commute home is guaranteed to be a nightmare. This probably isn’t a good time to ask her for a memory upgrade for your laptop.

As part of understanding what your audience needs to hear, you need to work out what their priorities are. Catch a manager

who’s just been given a hard time by her boss because some

source code got lost, and you’ll have a more receptive listener to your ideas on source code repositories. Make what you’re saying relevant in time, as well as in content. Sometimes all it takes is the simple question,「Is this a good time to talk about…?’’

CHOOSE A STYLE

Adjust the style of your delivery to suit your audience. Some people want a formal「just the facts’’ briefing. Others like a long, wide-ranging chat before getting down to business. What is

their skill level and experience in this area? Are they experts?

Newbies? Do they need hand-holding or just a quick tl;dr? If in doubt, ask.

Remember, however, that you are half of the communication

transaction. If someone says they need a paragraph describing something and you can’t see any way of doing it in less than several pages, tell them so. Remember, that kind of feedback is a form of communication, too.

MAKE IT LOOK GOOD

Your ideas are important. They deserve a good-looking vehicle to convey them to your audience.

Too many developers (and their managers) concentrate solely

on content when producing written documents. We think this is a mistake. Any chef (or watcher of the Food Network) will tell you that you can slave in the kitchen for hours only to ruin your efforts with poor presentation.

There is no excuse today for producing poor-looking printed

documents. Modern software can produce stunning output,

regardless of whether you’re writing using Markdown or using a

word processor. You need to learn just a few basic commands. If you’re using a word processor, use its style sheets for

consistency. (Your company may already have defined style

sheets that you can use.) Learn how to set page headers and

footers. Look at the sample documents included with your

package to get ideas on style and layout. Check the spelling, first automatically and then by hand. After awl, their are spelling miss steaks that the chequer can knot ketch.

INVOLVE YOUR AUDIENCE

We often find that the documents we produce end up being less important than the process we go through to produce them. If possible, involve your readers with early drafts of your

document. Get their feedback, and pick their brains. You’ll build a good working relationship, and you’ll probably produce a

better document in the process.

BE A LISTENER

There’s one technique that you must use if you want people to listen to you: listen to them. Even if this is a situation where you have all the information, even if this is a formal meeting with you standing in front of 20 suits—if you don’t listen to them, they won’t listen to you.

Encourage people to talk by asking questions, or ask them to restate the discussion in their own words. Turn the meeting into a dialog, and you’ll make your point more effectively. Who

knows, you might even learn something.

GET BACK TO PEOPLE

If you ask someone a question, you feel they’re impolite if they don’t respond. But how often do you fail to get back to people

when they send you an email or a memo asking for information or requesting some action? In the rush of everyday life, it’s easy to forget. Always respond to emails and voicemails, even if the response is simply「I’ll get back to you later.’’ Keeping people informed makes them far more forgiving of the occasional slip, and makes them feel that you haven’t forgotten them.

Tip 12

It’s Both What You Say and the Way You Say It

Unless you work in a vacuum, you need to be able to

communicate. The more effective that communication, the

more influential you become.

DOCUMENTATION

Finally, there’s the matter of communicating via

documentation. Typically, developers don’t give much thought to documentation. At best it is an unfortunate necessity; at worst it is treated as a low-priority task in the hope that

management will forget about it at the end of the project.

Pragmatic Programmers embrace documentation as an integral

part of the overall development process. Writing documentation can be made easier by not duplicating effort or wasting time, and by keeping documentation close at hand—in the code itself.

In fact, we want to apply all of our pragmatic principles to documentation as well as to code.

Tip 13

Build Documentation In, Don’t Bolt It On

It’s easy to produce good-looking documentation from the

comments in source code, and we recommend adding

comments to modules and exported functions to give other developers a leg up when they come to use it.

However, this doesn’t mean we agree with the folks who say that every function, data structure, type declaration, etc., needs its own comment. This kind of mechanical comment writing

actually makes it more difficult to maintain code: now there are two things to update when you make a change. So restrict your non-API commenting to discussing why something is done, its purpose and its goal. The code already shows how it is done, so commenting on this is redundant—and is a violation of the DRY

principle.

Commenting source code gives you the perfect opportunity to

document those elusive bits of a project that can’t be

documented anywhere else: engineering trade-offs, why

decisions were made, what other alternatives were discarded, and so on.

SUMMARY

Know what you want to say.

Know your audience.

Choose your moment.

Choose a style.

Make it look good.

Involve your audience.

Be a listener.

Get back to people.

Keep code and documentation together.

Online Communication

Everything we’ve said about communicating in writing applies equally to email, social media posts, blogs, and so on. Email in particular has evolved to the point where it is a mainstay of corporate communications; it’s used to discuss contracts, to settle disputes, and as evidence in court. But for some reason, people who would never send out a shabby paper document are happy to fling nasty-looking, incoherent emails around the world.

Our tips are simple:

Proofread before you hit SEND .

Check your spelling and look for any accidental auto-correct mishaps.

Keep the format simple and clear.

Keep quoting to a minimum. No one likes to receive back their own 100-line email with「I agree」tacked on.

If you’re quoting other people’s email, be sure to attribute it, and quote it inline (rather than as an attachment). Same when quoting on social media platforms.

Don’t flame or act like a troll unless you want it to come back and haunt you later. If you wouldn’t say it to someone’s face, don’t say it online.

Check your list of recipients before sending. It’s become a cliché to criticize the boss over departmental email without realizing that the boss is on the cc list. Better yet, don’t criticize the boss over email.

As countless large corporations and politicians have discovered, email and social media posts are forever. Try to give the same attention and care to email as you would to any written memo or report.

CHALLENGES

There are several good books that contain sections on

communications within teams, including The Mythical Man-

Month: Essays on Software Engineering [Bro96] and Peopleware:

Productive Projects and Teams [DL13]. Make it a point to try to

read these over the next 18 months. In addition, Dinosaur Brains:

Dealing with All Those Impossible People at Work [BR89]

discusses the emotional baggage we all bring to the work

environment.

The next time you have to give a presentation, or write a memo advocating some position, try working through the advice in this section before you start. Explicitly identify the audience and what you need to communicate. If appropriate, talk to your audience afterward and see how accurate your assessment of their needs was.
