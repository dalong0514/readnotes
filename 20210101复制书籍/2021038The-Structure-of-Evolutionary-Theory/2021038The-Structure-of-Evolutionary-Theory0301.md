Lamarck and the Birth of Modern Evolutionism in Two-Factor Theories

THE MYTHS OF LAMARCK

In 1793, the French revolutionary government, having expunged the past by executing a monarch, proclaimed a new beginning of time. They renamed the months, and started the calendar all over again with the foundation of the Republic in September 1792. The old months had honored emperors and gods, but the new months would celebrate the passing of seasons by weather and activity — Brumaire (the foggy month in fall), Thermidor (the hot times of mid summer), and Nivose (for the depth of a frosty winter), for example.

Jean-Baptiste-Pierre-Antoine de Monet, Chevalier de Lamarck (1744-1829) — now redesignated, with democratic brevity, as Citoyen Lamarck — became professor of "lower" animals (the old Linnaean classes Insecta and Vermes, later renamed "invertebrates" by Lamarck himself) at the newly founded Museum d'Histoire Naturelle in 1793. (His previous work, nearly all in botany, had not prepared him for this new role, though he had long been an avid shell collector and student of conchology.) Until 1797, he had supported the conventional idea of species as fixed entities. But he then be­came an evolutionist, first expressing this new view of life in his inaugural lec­ture for the Museum course of 1800, and then in three major works — the Recherches sur I'organisation des corps vivans of 1802; his most famous work, the Philosophie zoologique of 1809; and the Histoire naturelle des animaux sans vertebres of 1815-1822.

In an ironic symbol, Lamarck first presented his evolutionary theories in an inaugural lecture pronounced on the 21st day of Floreal, year VIII (May 11, 1800) — in the month of flowering. For Lamarck's theory suffered the oppo­site fate of withering, and the scorn of inattention. We all know the image of Lamarck — an impression carefully nurtured, for different reasons, by friends and foes alike — as a lonely man (a prophet before his time to some, a kook to others), penniless, friendless, and, finally, blind; living out the last days of a long and sad life, supported only by his devoted daughters.

This image of a forgotten failure was fostered by the two greatest figures of 19th century natural history — first by Cuvier, and later by Darwin. Darwin said little about Lamarck (see pp. 192–197), but his derision still permeates our view. Cuvier did far more damage. I don't know what lip service Cuvier gave to the ancient maxim de mortuis nil nisi bonum (say only good of the dead), but he violated this precept with avidity in writing eloges (eulogies) of deceased colleagues. Cuvier, the consummate politician, understood the power thus granted to shape history in his own favor. For what forum could be less subject to rebuttal, and therefore more suited for easy passage into re­ceived truth. As master of eloges, Cuvier held enormous power over his col­leagues, as long as he could outlive them! (see pp. 309–312 on Geoffroy's re­venge for the same reason). His official eloge of Lamarck is a masterful, if repugnant, document of propaganda directed against a close colleague and former friend who had (in Cuvier's view) gone beyond the pale in both meth­odology of research and content of belief. Cuvier used his eloge as an oppor­tunity to castigate Lamarck, and thus provide a lesson in proper procedure for aspiring scientists.

Cuvier began with cloying praise, and then portrayed his need to criticize as a sad duty: "In sketching the life of one of our most celebrated naturalists, we have conceived it to be our duty, while bestowing the commendation they deserve on the great and useful works which science owes to him, likewise to give prominence to such of his productions in which too great indulgence of a lively imagination had led to results of a more questionable kind, and to indi­cate, as far as we can, the cause or, if it may be so expressed, the genealogy of his deviations" (1832, 1984 edition, p. 435).

Cuvier then dismembered Lamarck on two grounds. First, with justice in the claim (however unkind the rhetoric), he castigated Lamarck for reaching too far without foundation, and for building all-encompassing systems in the speculative mode. (This criticism reflected Cuvier's main unhappiness with Lamarck's science. Cuvier viewed himself as a modernist, committed to rigor­ous empirical documentation, and no extension beyond direct evidence in the search for explanations — as opposed to Lamarck's unfruitful, comprehensive speculation in the antiquated esprit de systeme, or spirit of system): "He had meditated on the general laws of physics and chemistry, on the phenomena of the atmosphere, on those of living bodies, and on the origin of the globe and its revolutions. Psychology, and the higher branches of metaphysics, were not beyond the range of his contemplations; and on all these subjects he had formed a number of definite ideas . . . calculated to place every branch of knowledge on a new foundation" (1832, 1984 edition, p. 442).

Cuvier acknowledged Lamarck's excellent efforts in morphology and taxonomy, but then damned him for denigrating this admirable work as a trifle compared with all-embracing and useless theories. What a sorry spectacle: Lamarck in his armchair, challenging the great Lavoisier, the icon and martyr of true science. (Lavoisier was beheaded during the Reign of Terror.) "So inti­mately did he identify himself with his systems, and such was his desire that they should be propagated, that all other objects seemed to him subordinate, and even his greatest and most useful works appeared in his own eyes merely as the slight accessories of lofty speculations. Thus, while Lavoisier was creat­ing in his laboratory a new chemistry, founded on a beautiful and methodical series of experiments, M. de Lamarck, without attempting experiment, and destitute of the means of doing so, imagined that he had discovered another" (1832, 1984 edition, p. 442).

After ridiculing Lamarck's general method of system building, Cuvier mounted his second attack and dismembered the particular content of Lamarck's system, especially his evolutionary views. Cuvier did his former colleague a lasting disservice by caricaturing Lamarckian evolution, as the outcome of organic will, based on desires, translated into phyletic progress. Cuvier's rhetoric was brilliant, his characterization grossly distorted:

Wants and desires, produced by circumstances, will lead to other efforts, which will produce other organs. ... It is the desire and the attempt to swim that produces membranes in the feet of aquatic birds; wading in the water, and at the same time the desire to avoid wet, has lengthened the legs of such as frequent the sides of rivers . . . These principles once admitted, it will easily be perceived that nothing is wanting but time and circumstances to enable a monad or a polypus gradually and indiffer­ently to transform themselves into a frog, a stork, or an elephant (1832, 1984 edition, p. 446).

Finally, in an ultimate dismissal from a "hard" scientist (and with the tone of the Yahoo), Cuvier concludes: "A system established on such foundations may amuse the imagination of a poet; a metaphysician may derive from it an entirely new series of systems; but it cannot for a moment bear the examina­tion of anyone who has dissected a hand ... or even a feather" (1832, 1984 edition, p. 447).

Cuvier's caricature remains potent in our worst modern misunderstanding of Lamarck as a mystical vitalist, advancing the idea of an ineffable organic will against the ordinary physical causality of science. (Tit for tat, and how­ever unfairly, Lyell hurt Cuvier even more in return by caricaturing him as a theologically tainted, antiscientific catastrophist in geology.) But Lamarck, schooled (along with Cuvier) in the ideals of the French Enlightenment, was an ardent materialist. His idiosyncratic and unfruitful views about the nature of matter (arising primarily from his anti-Lavoisierian chemistry) led to pre­dictions of odd behavior for living bodies, but his basic notions of reduction and causality remained in the scientific mainstream. In his last great work, and in the context of his evolutionary theory, Lamarck defended a conven­tional view of mechanistic causality, and derided all teleological interpreta­tions. Goals, he argued, are false appearances reflecting an underlying causal necessity:

It is chiefly among the living, and most notably among Animals, that some have claimed to glimpse a purpose in nature's operations. Even in this case the purpose is mere appearance, not reality. Indeed, in every type of animal organism, there subsists an order of things ... whose only effect is to lead to what seems to us to be a goal, but is essentially a neces­sity. The order achieves this necessity through the progressive development of parts, which are [also] shaped by environmental conditions (1815, in Corsi, 1988, p. 190).

Since watchdogs tend to be more vigilant than publicists, Lamarck's opponents among the natural theologians often noted (and deplored) his materialism. The pious Reverend William Kirby, one of Britain's greatest entomolo­gists, made a statement that I regard as both trenchant and descriptively accurate (in Burkhardt, 1977, p. 189): "Lamarck's great error, and that of many other of his compatriots, is materialism; he seems to have no faith in anything but body, attributing every thing to a physical, and scarcely any­thing to a metaphysical cause. Even when, in words, he admits the being of a God, he employs the whole strength of his intellect to prove that he had noth­ing to do with the works of creation. Thus he excludes the Deity from the government of the world that he has created, putting nature in his place."

Curiously, each generation of historians and biological commentators has to discover, anew and for itself — and by reading original sources rather than imbibing mythology — this general and mainstream scientific position held by a man with such idiosyncratic views on specific subjects (see Mayr, 1972, and Simpson, 1961a, for the scientists; Gillispie, 1959; Burkhardt, 1977; and Corsi, 1988, for historians). For example, Gillispie wrote in his classic article for the Darwinian centenary (1959, p. 275): "Life is a purely physical phe­nomenon in Lamarck, and it is only because science has (quite rightly) left be­hind his conception of the physical that he has been systematically misunder­stood and assimilated to a theistic or vitalistic tradition which in fact he held in abhorrence."

This correction allows us to see Lamarck as a key figure in and of his time — an age as rife with intellectual, as with political, ferment — and not as a painfully peripheral, and actively marginalized, oddball. In a meticu­lous analysis of French scientific thought, Corsi (1988) has placed Lamarck's views firmly amidst the debates of his age, and also demonstrated that his the­ories were not so ignored or ridiculed as tradition maintains.

I am not arguing that Lamarck was popular in his day, only that he was contemporary. In many ways, Lamarck became his own worst enemy, and he owed his fall from favor towards obscurity as much to his own unfortunate habits as to the peculiarity of his ideas. He possessed no political skills, and could only fare badly in any match with the masterful Cuvier (in an age that must rank as the best and the worst of all political times). He continued to practice the old style of speculative system building in an increasingly empiri­cal climate. He was combative, and so self-assured, that affirmation without any documentation became his principal style of argument. Consider this claim for use and disuse from the Philosophie zoologique (1809, 1984 edi­tion, p. 108): "Nothing of all this can be considered as hypothesis or private opinion; on the contrary, they are truths which, in order to be made clear, only require attention and the observation of facts." Lamarck's certainty ex­tended even to the maximally dubious subject of weather forecasting: "I am not submitting an opinion, but announcing a fact. I am indicating an order of things that anyone can verify through observation" (in Corsi, 1988, p. 59). The old story that Napoleon refused a copy of Lamarck's Philosophie zoologique is apparently true (unlike most legends in the history of science). But Napoleon's motive has not generally been recognized: he mistook the nature of the gift, thinking that he had been offered one of Lamarck's discredited volumes of weather predictions for the coming year!

LAMARCK AS A SOURCE

The preceding section on Lamarck as a man of his time may seem peripheral, if not wholly out of place, in a chapter on hierarchical causation in evolution­ary theory, but this theme holds a definite place in the logic of my presen­tation. Such a diffuse and comprehensive idea as evolution can claim no sin­gle initiator or unique starting point. The search for precursors in ancient Greece, while overextended (Osborn, 1894), rests upon a legitimate founda­tion. But Lamarck holds a special place as the first to transcend footnote, pe­ripheral commentary, and partial commitment, and to formulate a consistent and comprehensive evolutionary theory — in Corsi's words (1988, p. xi) "the first major evolutionist synthesis in modern biology."

Moreover, even in a book parochially skewed to British and American evolutionary theory, Lamarck still merits the status of an ultimate source. Ger­man and French biologists could cite a variety of references from their in­digenous movements of Naturphilosophie (Oken, Meckel, or Goethe himself, for example) and the revolutionary times of the Age of Reason (Buffon, Maupertuis, Diderot, and a host of largely forgotten Enlightenment figures). England could boast a few precursors (including Darwin's grandfather Eras­mus), but no strong movements. Ironically, as Darwin, Wallace, and all the great mid-century evolutionists acknowledged, Lamarck instigated both ma­jor treatments of evolutionary thought in English before 1859: first, the accu­rate and extensive, if negative, presentation of Lamarck's system by Charles Lyell in the first four chapters of The Principles of Geology, Volume 2 (1832); and second, the anonymously published (1844) Vestiges of the Natural His­tory of Creation. The author of that scandalous and widely debated book, the Scottish publisher Robert Chambers, acknowledged Lamarck, via Lyell, as his major source of inspiration.

I have (see Chapter 1) rejected Hull's genealogical approach to the defini­tion of theories, but I certainly defend this criterion (almost tautologically, I suppose) for the tracing of influences. Of Lamarck's foundational impact on English evolutionary thought, Hull (1985, p. 803) writes: "Darwin first con­fronted a detailed explication of the species problem in the context of Lyell's refutation of Lamarck in his Principles of Geology . . . Others like Spencer and Chambers were converted by reading Lyell's refutation of Lamarck; still others like Wallace and Powell were led to entertain the possibility of evolu­tion by reading Chambers." We cannot, in short, view Lamarck as an oddity, cast aside by his own contemporaries, and irrelevant except as a whipping boy ever since. And we must acknowledge that Lamarckism, properly de­fined, forms a coherent and innovative system in the context of its own time.

Lamarck's active centrality provides a foundation to my historical argu­ment because his theory, as presented in the next section, rests upon the con­cept of hierarchy, with distinct causes at two primary levels. Lamarck's hier­archy differs radically in form and logic from any acceptable modern version; indeed, I shall reject the basis of Lamarck's notion as an important compo­nent in developing the modern interpretation.

Lamarck's concept became Darwin's context. In perhaps the most widely quoted of all his letters, Darwin wrote to Hooker on January 11, 1844 (in F. Darwin, 1887, volume 2, p. 23): "I am almost convinced (quite contrary to opinion I started with) that species are not (it is like confessing a murder) im­mutable. Heaven forfend me from Lamarck nonsense of a 'tendency to pro­gression,' 'adaptations from the slow willing of animals,' etc.! But the conclu­sions I am led to are not widely different from his; though the means of change are wholly so. I think I have found out (here's presumption!) the sim­ple way by which species become exquisitely adapted to various ends."

Hierarchy has resided at the heart of evolutionary theory from' the very beginning, despite a temporary eclipse during the rally-round-the-flag pe­riod of strict Darwinism at the middle of the 20th century. When the Beagle docked at Montevideo, Darwin received his most precious item of mail — volume two of Lyell`s Principles of Geology. His joy at this gift, and his careful study of the contents, are well attested. This volume began with a long and careful exposition of Lamarck's theory, fairly but negatively described by Lyell. Darwin formulated his focal concept of small-scale change, based on organismal advantage as the mechanism (by extrapolation) for all evolu­tion, as an explicit denial of Lamarck's hierarchy of causes. I believe that Darwin correctly rejected an untenable theory of hierarchy based on distinct causes for different levels, but that (in a historically portentous example of the cliche about babies and bathwater) he carried a good thing too far by dismissing the general concept entirely. I conceived this book — The Structure of Evolutionary Theory — both as a celebration of Darwin's exemplary tough­ness, and as a call for the reinstitution of causal hierarchy, properly refor­mulated.

LAMARCK'S TWO-FACTOR THEORY: SOURCES FOR THE

TWO PARTS

In the short period of 1797 to 1800, beginning with the Directory in power and culminating in Napoleon's coup d'etat of 18th Brumaire year VIII (No­vember 9,1799), Lamarck became an evolutionist and constructed the major features of his theory. Scholars have identified many sources as Lamarck's pri­mary impetus — his developing views on spontaneous generation, his work on living and fossil shells (Burkhardt, 1977), the implications of his unconven­tional theories in physics and chemistry (Corsi, 1988). But I wish to present the logic, rather than the ontogeny, of his final and completed argument.

Lamarck's evolutionary system attempts to marry two sets of ideas, each embodying a primary module of his conceptual world. These two sets com­mingle at their edges, but their distinction establishes the basis of Lamarckism, and provides a hierarchical context for this first comprehensive attempt to formulate an evolutionary theory.

The first set: environment and adaptation

The first set focuses on adaptation, and links this key attribute of organisms to the history of environments, the general pace of change, and the intimate relationship between physical and biological worlds through time. (Corsi, 1988, grants primacy to this set in the ontogeny of Lamarck's developing ideas; I accept this assertion but note that the same set, curiously, becomes secondary in the logic of Lamarck's fully formulated argument.) The frame­work can be entered in several places, with the rest of the edifice following by implication from a few basic premises. Lamarck's views on extinction provide a good beginning.

In opposition to his colleague Cuvier, and acting as a major source of their estrangement, Lamarck denied that true extinction (defined as termination of genealogical lines) could occur — though he allowed an exception for large quadrupeds wiped out by human predation. (Cuvier, on the other hand, embraced extinction both as the foundation of geological ordering, and as a cardinal indication that animals cannot evolve to match changing environ­ments.) Yet, as a molluscan paleontologist, Lamarck knew that the morphol­ogies of organisms within major taxonomic groups changed in an orderly manner through time. Evolution of outward form, with consequent preserva­tion of lineages from extinction, represents the only alternative to termina­tion of lineages followed by creation of new and different morphologies.

Lamarck far out-Lyelled Lyell in his commitment to uniformitarian geol­ogy (an ironic fact, given Lyell's lambasting of Lamarckian biology in his own treatise on geological uniformity). Lamarck's geological volume, the Hydrogeologie of Year X (1802), may strike us as bizarre in several particular as­sertions; but his general commitment to uniformity cannot be denied as a primary feature. Lamarck would admit no causes not now observable in op­eration; in particular, no paroxysms or catastrophes beyond the range of modern effects. He adopted Hutton's rigidly ahistorical vision (see Gould, 1987b) and postulated a geological history ruled by aqueous erosion (hence the title of his work). Cycles of construction and erosion unfold so many times, and in so similar a manner, that individual moments lose any distinct­ness, given past and future repetition of their features. Ocean waters carve mountains and continents (though Lamarck made an exception for volcanoes built by magmas). Currents tend to flow from east to west, and continents therefore erode on their eastern borders and accrete by deposition at their western edges. In a sense, therefore, continents undergo a slow westward march around the globe. This curious circumnavigation has occurred several times during the earth's extended history. But why doesn't the process yield directionality as erosion wears continents down to flat plains permanently be­low water? Lamarck countered with his distinctive mineralogical thesis: all rocks arise as ultimate products of organic deposition. Erosion may break continents into tiny comminuted grains, bits, and dissolved material; but as long as organisms maintain their steady state of abundance, these raw materi­als will be taken up again and redeposited as new rocks fashioned from the products of life.

In summary, if lineages could not become extinct, if climate and geology changed in a continuous and insensibly gradual manner throughout geologi­cal time, and if the forms and functions of organisms always matched the fea­tures of their local environments, then gradual, adaptive evolution becomes a logical necessity.

But by what mechanism will this ineluctable evolution occur? In particular, since steady, continuous alteration of environment provides the impetus for organic change, how does information flow from new environments to mod­ify the old forms of organisms? Lamarck's answer to this riddle — building only one corner of his complete system — invokes the familiar ideas that later generations would call "Lamarckism" when the rest of his edifice had been forgotten. Lamarck begins by formulating the central principle of his func­tionalist credo — the counterintuitive statement, later embraced by Darwin as well, that form follows function as the order of life's history. When we con­template any adaptation of an organism, and consider the intricate correla­tion of form with function, we naturally assume (or so Lamarck asserts) that form comes first, and that function can only follow. (God makes a wing, and a bird can then fly, to cite a nonevolutionary example.) But Lamarck ad­vanced the paradoxical reverse order as his key premise: new habits lead to altered structures.*

In Lamarck's proposed mechanisms, environment changes first. Indeed, environment changes slowly and continuously on our uniformitarian planet. "Every locality," Lamarck writes (1809, p. Ill), "itself changes in time as to exposure, climate, character and quality, although with such extreme slow­ness, according to our notions, that we ascribe it to complete stability." Or­ganisms must accommodate to these changes by alterations in their habits — chewing with greater strength if the food gets tougher, moving more vigor­ously if the temperature gets colder. These altered habits, if long sustained, must feed back upon the organism in the guise of altered morphology or physiology — a thicker beak to crack the harder seeds, longer hair on a tougher skin to resist the cold.

At this point in the argument, the famous "Lamarckian" theory of inheri­tance finally enters. As many scholars have documented, "soft," or "La­marckian" inheritance represented the folk wisdom of Lamarck's time, and cannot be regarded as an innovation of the Philosophic zoologique. There­fore, the restriction of "Lamarckism" to this relatively small and non-distinc­tive corner of Lamarck's thought must be labeled as more than a misnomer, and truly a discredit to the memory of a man and his much more compre­hensive system. In any case, the changes wrought by new habits during an organism's lifetime can be passed directly to offspring in the form of altered heredity. Soft inheritance may have been the standard belief of the time, but Lamarck certainly recognized its crucial and particular role in his system. He wrote with his characteristic lack of doubt (1815, in Burkhardt, 1984, p. xxix): "The law of nature by which new individuals receive all that has been acquired in organization during the lifetime of their parents is so true, so striking, so much attested by the facts, that there is no observer who has been unable to convince himself of its reality." Lamarck abstracts his idea of inher­itance as two principles, usually printed in italics in his texts to emphasize their importance, and known ever since as:

• use and disuse

• the inheritance of acquired characters (1809, volume 1, p. 113)

Even if this theory of inheritance ranked as folk wisdom of the day, Lamarck's revolutionary statement, one of the great transforming insights in the history of human thought, resides in the preceding principle that trans­lates this mode of inheritance into a theory of evolution — the triggering of change in form by prior alterations in behavior. Lamarck clearly recognized the central role of this claim, for he always cited this counterintuitive se­quence of causality — from altered environments to changed habits to modi­fied form — as the linchpin of his entire system. In the Philosophie zoologique, he quotes his own earlier statement from the Recherches of 1802: "It is not the organs, that is to say, the nature and shape of the parts of an animal's body, that have given rise to its special habits and faculties; but it is, on the contrary, its habits, mode of life and environment that have in course of time controlled the shape of its body, the number and state of its organs and, lastly, the faculties which it possesses" (1809, p. 114). Lamarck then makes his threefold causal chain — environment to habits to form — even more explicit (1809, p. 126): "This is a fact that can never be disputed; since nature shows us in innumerable other instances the power of environment over habit and that of habit over the shape, arrangement and proportions of the parts of animals."

Causality might run from altered environment to changed organism, but Lamarck insisted that he did not view organisms as passive writing slates, ripe for inscription by the modifying hand of environment. Environmental change translates to adaptation of form only through the intermediary of or­ganic action expressed, in higher creatures at least, as altered habits: "What­ever the environment may do, it does not work any direct modification what­ever in the shape and organization of animals. But great alterations in the environment of animals lead to great alterations in their needs, and these al­terations in their needs necessarily lead to others in their activities. Now if the new needs become permanent, the animals then adopt new habits which last as long as the needs that evoked them" (1809, p. 107).

These statements about the responses of animals to "felt needs" (Lamarck used the word besoins) left Lamarck open to charges of mystical vitalism when distorted for rhetorical purposes by Cuvier, or approached with over­wrought caution by Darwin. One might caricature this part of Lamarck's sys­tem by saying that a giraffe felt a need for a long neck, stretched ever so hard, and then passed the results of these successful efforts directly to offspring. But a fair assessment of Lamarck's actual words shows that he advocated no inef­fable willing, but only the commonplace idea that a change in environment can, in an almost mechanical way, elicit an organic response in terms of al­tered habits: "Variations in the environment induce changes in the needs, habits, and mode of life of living beings . . . these changes give rise to modi­fications or developments in their organs and the shape of their parts" (1809, p. 45).

This first set of Lamarckian ideas contains nothing that should have of­fended Darwin, while several points embody the deeper functionalist and adaptationist spirit of the Darwinian view of life. Darwin did not grant such crucial emphasis to soft inheritance, although he accepted the principles of use and disuse and inheritance of acquired characters, and he awarded them a subsidiary role in his own theory. But two key items in this first set might be designated as decidedly Darwinian in spirit, if only because they advance and presage two of the half dozen most important ideas in Darwin's theory: the uniformity of environmental change,* and the functionalist first principle that change of habit sets the pathway to altered form. The mechanisms of change differ to be sure — altered habits establish new selection pressures for Darwin, but induce heritable modifications more directly for Lamarck — but both thinkers share a functionalist commitment.

I would argue that the structuralist-functionalist dichotomy precedes any particular theory of mechanism within either camp. Thus, we may view La­marck and Darwin as occupying the common ground of functionalism, with their differing mechanisms of natural selection and soft inheritance as ver­sions of the same deeper commitment. Therefore, if Lamarckism only encom­passed this first set of ideas, we might interpret Lamarck as the inception of a smooth transition to Darwin. But Lamarckism also includes a second set of concepts, which, when combined with the first set into Lamarck's full system, builds an evolutionary theory truly opposed to Darwin's chief theoretical concept and operational principle as well.

The second set: progress and taxonomy

The first set, by itself, leads to a logical dilemma for Lamarck's view of life and his professional commitments. Adaptation to changing local environ­ments may be well explained, but Lamarck's truly ahistorical uniformitarianism implies that life can manifest no progress, or no linear order at all, if ad­aptation matches creatures to an environmental history without direction. (This issue arose for many environmental determinists in both creationist and evolutionist camps. Buckland, and most of his catastrophist colleagues, maintained their allegiance to life's increasing perfection by positing a direc­tional history of environmental change — increasing inclemency, for exam­ple, requiring improvement in organic design to meet the growing challenge. This option was not open to Lamarck, who espoused a steady state, non-directionalist geology.)

Yet Lamarck firmly advocated a taxonomic ordering of organisms by the conventional scheme of increasing perfection in organization. This subject greeted him on a daily basis, for he held the post of curator for invertebrates at the Museum in Paris, and his yearly courses featured this organizing theme of linear order. (As a pedagogic device, Lamarck usually started with humans, as the "highest" creature, and then discussed the rest of nature as degrada­tion from maximal complexity. He defended this procedure, even in his evo­lutionary writings, as a method for teaching, even though historical order had actually moved from simple to complex — for he argued that one must under­stand the full and final possibilities before grasping the imperfect and incipi­ent beginnings.)

Lamarck argued that a second set of forces, distinct from the causal flow of environment to organism, produced nature's other primary pattern of advancing complexity. But this claim for an efficient and universal cause of progress engendered another dilemma: why, on our present and ancient earth, do some organisms still maintain the simplest anatomies? Why were these forms not pushed up the ladder of complexity ages ago? Lamarck resolved this problem with the last major argument of his full system — con­tinuous spontaneous generation. New life continues to arise from chemical constituents; these simple forms begin their march up the ladder, while re­placements at their lowly status continue to form anew. (Thus, in a curious sense, as Simpson and others have noted, Lamarck's evolutionary system op­erates as a grand steady state, even as any particular bit of protoplasm moves on a historical path up the sequence. The ladder of life really operates as a continuous escalator, with all steps occupied at all moments. The simplest forms continue to arise by spontaneous generation from chemical constitu­ents formed by the breakdown of higher creatures upon their individual deaths.)

Lamarck argued that his unconventional chemistry, emphasizing the role of fire and the motions of subtle fluids, engendered these two central phenom­ena — spontaneous generation and progress up the ladder — as consequences of deeper physical principles. Lavoisier had destroyed the old quadripartite taxonomy of air, water, earth, and fire in developing his theory of chemical el­ements. Lamarck opposed the "new chemistry" by asserting the old taxon­omy, and his own distinctive claim for the primacy of fire. Much of Cuvier's disdain focused not on Lamarck's biology, but on his allegiance to this anti­quated chemistry.

Lamarck, who excelled in crisp assertion but not in clear exposition, never fully specified why chemicals should aggregate to life, or what subtle motions of physical fluids would build the increasing complexity of anatomy. He held that the products of spontaneous generation arose as small, soft and un-differentiated primal forms. The complexifying force — which Lamarck usu­ally called le pouvoir de la vie or la force qui tend sans cesse a composer I'organisation — resides in the motion of fluids and their inevitable tendency to carve channels, sacs, and passageways in soft tissues. This process, ex­tended through time, gradually builds ever greater complexity. In the Histoire naturelle of 1815, Lamarck offers his most explicit statement about this pro­cess: "As the movement of fluids . . . accelerates, the vital forces would grow proportionately, and so will their power. The rapid motion of fluids will etch canals between delicate tissues. Soon their flow will begin to vary, leading to the emergence of distinct organs. The fluids themselves, now more elaborate, will become more complex, engendering a greater variety of secretions and substances composing the organs" (1815, in Corsi, 1988, p. 189).

Lamarck did clearly assert that these internal carvings of complexity main­tained a relentless and intrinsic causal basis separate from the apparatus of response to "felt needs" used in building adaptations to changing local environments. He contrasted the two sets of forces in writing: "There exists a variety of environmental factors which induces a corresponding variety in the shapes and structure of animals, independent of that special variety which necessarily results from the progress of the complexity of organization in each animal" (1809, p. 112). He also stated that the entire escalator of com­plexity could run a full course in a constant environment: "If nature had given existence to none but aquatic animals and if all these animals had al­ways lived in the same climate, the same kind of water, the same depth, etc., etc., we should then no doubt have found a regular and even continuous gra­dation in the organization of these animals" (1809, p. 69).

Lamarck therefore proposes two distinct sets of forces to construct what he regarded as the two preeminent features of life — progress in linear order, and adaptation to environment. The interactions of these sets — not the causes or properties of either one — establish the foundation of Lamarckism, properly defined in his own expansive terms.

Distinctness of the two sets

I shall argue in the next section that these two sets of concepts must be regarded as both logically distinct and opposed in Lamarck's system. My basis for regarding Lamarckism as a theory of hierarchy lies in this division. Lamarck, as we shall see, always presents the two sets as separate in his later evolutionary writing, and scholars of Lamarckism have accepted this contrast as crucial (Burkhardt, 1977; Mayr, 1972; Simpson, 1961). But Lamarck, as noted several times above, remains a frustrating figure for historians. His as­sertions are bold, even dogmatic; but his arguments tend to be sketchy, full of elisions, or even self-contradictory. These frustrations become most apparent in Lamarck's treatment of his two primary forces (as Corsi, 1988, has dis­cussed with great insight). The explicit assertions of his later works rank the two forces as distinct and opposed, but both the ontogeny and logic of Lamarck's argument shows more "leakage" than his words would suggest. Consider the following, as stressed by Corsi and Burkhardt:

Ontogeny. Although Lamarck presents the forces of adaptation as devi­ations from, and therefore secondary to, the primary causes that build com­plexity, he apparently developed his mechanism for progress from his previ­ously formulated ideas about adaptation (Corsi, 1988; and newly discovered evidence in Gould, 2000d). Still, the psychological source of a theory needn't map its eventual logical structure, and this point, while interesting, scarcely compromises the distinctness and ranking of the two sets.

Causation. At several points, Lamarck breaches the boundaries be­tween his sets in discussing causation.

(1) Soft inheritance works in both sets. Whether an organism becomes more complex because fluids carve channels by intrinsic chemistry, or be­comes better adapted because habits change in response to altered environ­ments, the acquired features must still be passed to offspring by direct inheri­tance. Still, a common mechanism may work in two modes, and this linkage does not compromise Lamarck's claim for distinctness.

(2) The style of action for soft inheritance in adaptation depends upon the state of complexity engendered by opposing forces of progress. Lamarck di­vided organisms into three ascending groups designated, in the old Aristote­lian terms, as insensitive, sensitive, and rational. The first group, too simple to mount a creative response to external change, reacts to environment not by altered habits, but by direct influence. The capacity for active response, Lamarck's famous sentiment interieur, only arises in the second group and unleashes the tripartite causal sequence of changed environment to altered habit to modified form.

(3) The real blurring occurs when we try to make sense of Lamarck's claim that forces of progress can build the entire sequence from infusorian to com­plex vertebrate without any environmental change. Lamarck surely makes this assertion explicitly, without hesitation (see citation on p. 187), and the distinctness of his two forces depends upon this potential independence. But Lamarck does not work out a consistent justification, and several frustrated historians have even argued that he could not have done so without con­tradiction — that his system, in other words, suffers from a true defect in logic of argument on this point.

The simplest organisms, Lamarck states, are carved out and complexified by "subtle" and "imponderable" fluids — caloric and electricity in his system. These fluids work in their intrinsic way to produce increased complexity. But as animals differentiate and harden, fluids must flow in preset channels; the weak imponderables then lose their power to mold, and the body's own pon­derable fluids must assume this role. (Lamarck locates this transition at about the echinoderm grade of organization.) At this level, the "power of life" should become inoperable without an impetus from environmental change — and the two sets of forces should therefore commingle. Protected inside a rigid body, and constrained to flow in preexisting channels, how can the ponderable fluids produce further advances in complexity unless changed en­vironments elicit altered habits, thus modifying form and permitting the pon­derables to flow in new ways (see Corsi, 1988, p. 200; and Burkhardt, 1977, p. 147).

Pattern. The "pure" distinction of progress and adaptation should pro­duce a single linear chain (for progress) with lateral deflections (for adapta­tion). Lamarck tried to construct such a topology, but could not carry his scheme to completion at two important places — the top and bottom of the ladder — where environment intruded upon the chain to blur the distinction of forces.

(1) Two sequences of spontaneous generation. Lamarck first proposed a single linear series of animals, starting with the spontaneous generation of infusorians (protistans) as free-living creatures in water. These unicells then aggregated to polyps and their relatives, and then to simple, bilaterally symmet­rical worms (see Fig. 3-1). However, Lamarck later discovered worms (the acoelous platyhelminths in modern terminology) without nerve cords. These worms ranked "higher" than polyps on grounds of their mobility, but could not be the descendants of polyps, unless the nerve cords of polyps had degen­erated and disappeared — impossibility under the "force that tends inces­santly to complicate organization." Thus, worms without nerve cords must represent part of a second and separate sequence of progress. Lamarck pro­posed an origin for this second sequence in the spontaneous generation of even simpler worms as parasites within the bodies of other organisms. If

different environments — a pond and the body of a complex creature — encour­age disparate inceptions for sequences of progress, then the two forces com­mingle (Fig. 3-2).

(2) Ramification at the top. Lamarck could not rank the vertebrates in lin­ear order. He followed the conventional path of fish to reptile, but could not convince himself that birds fell between reptiles and mammals in a genealogi­cal sense. He therefore permitted a fork, provoked by the environmental set of forces, at the very top of a ladder supposedly built by the unilinear impetus of progress (Fig. 3-3): "We cannot doubt," he wrote with characteristic cer­tainty (1809, p. 176), "that the reptiles by means of two distinct branches,

3-3. Lamarck allowed his linear sequence to branch at the apex of complexity (shown as the bottom in this figure because he begins with the lowest forms and works down by descent). Lamarck could not rank birds and mammals as part of the single sequence, and therefore allowed a branch after reptiles with birds on one side (left, culminating in egg-laying monotremes), and mammals to the right.

caused by the environment, have given rise, on the one hand, to the formation of birds, and, on the other hand, to the . . . mammals."

I doubt that we can take this analysis much further. Historians often err in trying to wrest consistency from great thinkers at all costs. Some issues are too difficult, too encompassing, too important, too socially embedded, or just too devoid of evidence, for resolution even by the finest scientists. Darwin never consolidated his contradictory ideas about progess (see Chapter 6), and Lamarck never found a thoroughly consistent way to fulfill his desired argu­ment for a full separation between two forces pulling evolution in orthogonal directions — up the ladder of progress, and sideways into lateral paths of adaptation. Lamarck may never have completed his scheme with success and consistency, but he made his desires clear to the point of redundancy. Lamarck's two-factor theory holds the distinction of being both the first evo­lutionary system in modern Western thought, and a strong argument for causal hierarchy. The two levels — in strong contrast with modern theories of hierarchy — are both causally distinct and contradictory for Lamarck, thus in­spiring Darwin's legitimate disparagement. Lamarck's distinction of levels, as discussed in the next section, unites hierarchy and evolution at the starting gate of the subject's modern history.

LAMARCK'S TWO-FACTOR THEORY: THE HIERARCHY OF PROGRESS AND DEVIATION

Lamarck had separated his sets of forces in order to account for the two pri­mary attributes of natural order — features that seemed to play off against, or even to contradict, each other. First, organisms form a progressive sequence from mo»ad to man, but the sequence abounds with gaps and deviations — so some other force must be disrupting a potentially smooth gradation. Second, organisms are well adapted to their environments, but most adaptations, from the tiny eyes of moles to the legendary necks of giraffes, represent particular specializations and departures from type (with many adaptations counting as losses or degenerations); therefore, adaptation cannot account for the sequence of progress.

Lamarck joined the two sets in a discordant union that operated more like a tug of war than a harmony. This partnership made no pretense to equality. A primary and dominating force — the march of progress — struggled to order organisms in a simple and sensible way; while a secondary and disrupting force — l'influence des circonstances, or adaptation to local environments — tore this order apart by pushing individual lineages into lateral deviations from the main track, thereby making the order of life rich, messy, and replete with clumps and gaps. This clear distinction of merit — the regular vs. the de­viant, the progressive vs. the merely fit — imparts the character of hierarchy to Lamarck's uneasy marriage of forces, with a primary factor doing its inexora­ble, underlying work at a higher level, while a secondary but more immediate factor of disruption plays upon the products of this higher level, pushing some forms into the side-channels of its influence. Burkhardt (1977, p. 87) captures both the hierarchy and conflict of forces in his epitome of Lamarck's system as an attempt to explain "how organisms would develop naturally" along a chain of progress "were it not for the constraining accidents of his­tory" pushing lineages into side channels of adaptation.

Lamarck worked his way slowly towards this final system of hierarchy and relative importance. The Floreal lecture of 1800 states that the "princi­pal masses" of major taxonomic units "are almost regularly spaced" (1800, 1984 edition, p. 416), but designates some peculiarly adapted species as "lat­eral ramifications" and "truly isolated points." But this lecture cites only environment as a trigger of change. The Recherches of 1802 adds the theme of "organic movements" forming new organs and faculties in an intrinsic se­quence of advance. By the time of his most famous work, the Philosophie zoologique of 1809, Lamarck "was explicit in portraying the diversity of ani­mal form as a result of two separate processes" (Burkhardt, 1977, p. 145), and he had formulated the arguments of hierarchy and relative importance as well. The Histoire naturelle of 1815-1822 then consolidates and advocates the hierarchical two-factor theory even more strongly.

In the Philosophie zoologique, Lamarck begins by claiming that, in an ide­ally simple world, a single sequence of progress would regulate all taxonomic order:

It may then be truly said that in each kingdom of living bodies the groups are arranged in a single graduated series, in conformity with the increas­ing complexity of organization and the affinities of the object. This series in the animal and vegetable kingdoms should contain the simplest and least organized of living beings at its anterior extremity, and ends with those whose organization and faculties are most perfect. Such appears to be the true order of nature, and such indeed is the order clearly disclosed to us by the most careful observation and an extended study of all her modes of procedure (1809, p. 59).

But this principle of progress remains insufficient in our actual world, where environmental change elicits adaptations off the main sequence: "It does not show us why the increasing complexity of the organization of ani­mals from the most imperfect to the most perfect exhibits only an irregular gradation, in the course of which there occur numerous anomalies or devia­tions with a variety in which no order is apparent" (1809, p. 107).

These "anomalies and deviations" are produced by a second, and clearly subsidiary, force — a "special factor" that thwarts the "incessantly working" source of general progress, and riddles the chain with gaps and lateral branches: "If the factor which is incessantly working toward complicating or­ganization were the only one which had any influence on the shape and or­gans of animals, the growing complexity of organization would everywhere be very regular. But it is not; nature is forced to submit her works to the influ­ence of their environment, and this environment everywhere produces varia­tions in them. This is the special factor which occasionally produces . . . the often curious deviations that may be observed in the progression" (1809, p. 69).

This special factor may be identified as environmental adaptation, initiated by changed habits and abetted by soft inheritance in the principles of use and disuse and the hereditary passage of acquired characters: "The environment exercises a great influence over the activities of animals, and as a result of this influence the increased and sustained use or disuse of any organ are causes of modification of the organization and shape of animals and give rise to the anomalies observed in the progress of the complexity of animal organiza­tion" (1809, p. 105).

As a primary sign of our estrangement from Lamarck's world, and our lack of understanding for his system, all "standard" textbook examples of Lamarckian evolution ignore his fundamental, higher-level principle of prog­ress, and only cite instances of lateral twigs built as highly specialized adapta­tions. We do this, I suppose, because adaptation and specialization constitute the major theme in our modern evolutionary vocabulary (in the altered guise of Darwinian causation), while the bulk of Lamarck's system has passed be­yond our notice into cognitive dissonance. In any case, every classical exam­ple — from eyeless moles, to webbed feet of water birds, to long legs of shore birds, to the blacksmith's strong right arm — ranks as a lateral deviation, not a stage on the main sequence. As for the greatest cliché and exemplar of all, the ubiquitous giraffe of our text-books, happily munching leaves at the tops of acacia trees, Lamarck provides only one paragraph of speculation — with no elaboration, no measurements, no data at all. An example can become a knee-jerk standard for many reasons, with cogent, complete documentation not always prominent among them (see Gould, 1991b, on the evolution of horses and the size of Hyracotherium). Nor does simple repetition enhance the probability of truth! Lamarck wrote this and only this about giraffes (even repeating a common error about differential lengths of fore and hind limbs):

It is interesting to observe the result of habit in the peculiar shape and size of the giraffe (Camelo-pardalis)': this animal, the tallest of the mam­mals, is known to live in the interior of Africa in places where the soil is nearly always arid and barren, so that it is obliged to browse on the leaves of trees and to make constant efforts to reach them. From this habit long maintained in all its race, it has resulted that the animal's fore­legs have become longer than its hind-legs, and that its neck is length­ened to such a degree that the giraffe, without standing up on its hind-legs, attains a height of six meters (1809, p. 122).

The final, complex order of life arises from an interplay of the two forces in conflict, with progress driving lineages up the ladder and adaptation forcing them aside into channels set by peculiarities of local environments: "The state in which we find any animal, is, on the one hand, the result of the increasing complexity of organization tending to form a regular gradation; and, on the other hand, of the influence of a multitude of very various conditions ever tending to destroy the regularity in the gradation of the increasing complexity of organization" (1809, p. 107). In his strongest characterization of the two forces as conflicting, Lamarck tells us in another passage that "nature's work [of progress] has often been modified, thwarted and even reversed by the in­fluence exercised by very different and indeed conflicting conditions of life upon animals exposed to them throughout a long succession of generations" (1809, p. 81).

Two additional statements in the Philosophie zoologique give dramatic expression to the absolute distinction of the forces, and to their hierarchical character, with progress as primary and regular, and diversity as secondary and disturbing. The first provides a vivid iconography of the two-factor theory: progress builds the regular and rising trunk; diversity snatches some items off this upward highway and pulls them into orthogonal blind alleys — "lateral ramifications" that peter out into "isolated points": "These irregu­larities ... are found in those organs which are the most exposed to the influ­ence of the environment; this influence involves similar irregularities in the shape and condition of the external parts, and gives rise to so great and singu­lar a diversity of species that, instead of being arranged like the main groups in a single linear series as a regularly graduated scale, these species often con­stitute lateral ramifications around the groups to which they belong, and their extremities are in reality isolated points" (1809, p. 59). The second features Lamarck's explicit statement about hierarchy, translated into differential taxonomic levels of attention. The broad forces of progress set relations among orders and classes; smaller and more immediate episodes of adaptation estab­lish species and genera:

Nature . . . has really formed a true scale ... as regards the increasing complexity of organization; but the gradations in this scale . . . are only perceptible in the main groups of the general series, and not in the spe­cies or even in the genera. This fact arises from the extreme diversity of conditions in which the various races of animals and plants exist; for these conditions have no relation to the increasing complexity of organi­zation; but they produce anomalies or deviations in the external shape and characters which could not have been brought about solely by the growing complexity of organization (1809, p. 58).

Lamarck's increasing conviction about the distinctness, hierarchical character, and conflicting nature of the two forces culminates in his last major work, the Histoire naturelle of 1815-1822. The force of progress has now be­come a "predominant prime cause," while adaptation ranks below as occa­sional and foreign, a disturbance strong enough to disrupt but not to efface nature's deeper law:

The plan followed by nature in producing animals clearly comprises a predominant prime cause. This endows animal life with the power to make organization gradually more complex . . . Occasionally a foreign, accidental, and therefore variable cause has interfered with the execution of the plan, without, however, destroying it. This has created gaps in the series, in the form either of terminal branches that depart from the series in several points and alter its simplicity, or of anomalies observable in specific apparatuses of various organisms (1815, in Corsi, 1988, p. 189).

ANTINOMIES OF THE TWO-FACTOR THEORY

We have seen how Lamarck formulated and intensified the two-factor theory from his first exposition of evolution in 1800 to his last and most comprehen­sive works. One might even say, following a developmental metaphor, that the two sets of forces differentiated from an originally more inchoate con­glomeration of evolutionary ideas, gradually becoming more different and more sharply defined. As the two sets grew along their orthogonal pathways, they became alternate centers of nucleation for the full realm of evolutionary ideas. All major items of this new conceptual world fell to one side or the other — as though two suns had entered an originally homogeneous universe, and all particles had to enter either one or the other gravitational system. Lamarck's two-factor theory separated the universe of evolutionary concepts into a set of dichotomies best characterized as antinomies, an unfamiliar word designating contradictions between two equally binding principles (and originally used to specify differences between ecclesiastical and secular law when both vied for domination in medieval states). The precipitation of ideas about Lamarck's two axes established a long list of antinomies that, in an im­portant way, has set the agenda of evolutionary biology ever since. Darwin opposed this structure of antinomies; others have advanced strong defenses, in whole or in part. The modern theory of hierarchy depends upon a selective defense, but in a manner radically different from Lamarck's formulation. Consider a few key items:

Ideal order (real) vs. disruption (disturbing). The interpre­tation of diversification by adaptation as lateral to, and disruptive of, an un­derlying lawful regularity marks an old tradition that Darwin fought fiercely by elevating the supposed "disturbing" force to the cause, by extrapolation, of all evolution. Curiously, since old traditions die hard, this antinomy re­mains potent (even under a Darwinian rubric) in the common claim that anagenesis, or evolutionary trends in lineages, should be viewed as distinct from cladogenesis, or diversification — and that speciation is, in Julian Hux­ley's words (1942, p. 389), "a biological luxury, without bearing upon the major and continuing trends of the evolutionary process."

Behind this issue, of course, and particularly well expressed in this first antinomy, stands the ancient credo of essentialism. Just as the essence or type never becomes fully incarnate in an actual object (because any material being must be subject to all the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune in our pal­pable world of accidents), so does the outside world of changing environ­ments deny full expression to the ideal march of progress.

Progress vs. diversity. Lamarck's expression of the fundamental vs. the disruptive; note Huxley's words above for a modern expression.

Internal vs. external, or intrinsic vs. interactive. The march of progress is intrinsically and internally generated as a consequence of the chemical properties of matter; this march represents the "essential" pro­cess of life, moving ever forward in the absence of any push or disturbance from external forces. Lamarck makes this contrast explicit in arguing that the march of progress would proceed to smooth completion even in an absolutely constant environment.

Immanence vs. unpredictability. The forces of progress, arising as consequences of chemical laws, generate a set of predictable products in­herent in the constitution of nature. Since the chain is constantly replenished by spontaneous generation, all stages exist at all times, and the entire se­quence constitutes a permanent part of nature. But the disturbing force of environmental change introduces the oddness and unpredictability of contin­gency. We can never know exactly what climatic change will occur, which lineage will be diverted into its channel, and how the resulting adaptation will form. Thus, our actual world becomes filled up with unique particulars. Gi­raffe necks do not arise by first principles of natural law, but as a contingency of dry climates and acacia trees at a particular time and place.

Timeless vs. historical. History requires distinctive moments that tell a story as a sequence of events. The force of progress may confer history upon any particular bolus of protoplasm as it mounts the ladder. But, in a larger sense, this force also cancels the usual meaning of history. Each step becomes predictable and repeatable; and each exists at every time (since spon­taneous generation continually replenishes the base). Thus, Lamarck's per­fecting force becomes essentially ahistorical. The rungs of the ladder are per­manent and always occupied; items pass up and through, but the forms are timeless. Genuine history enters via the disturbing force of environmental ad­aptation instead. A mole without eyes, a stork with long legs, a duck with webbed feet — all originate as nonrepeatable objects of a historical moment, triggered by a particular change of environment in a unique time and place.

Higher taxa vs. species and genera. Lamarck's two-factor the­ory is hierarchical. The force of progress — paramount, primary, and underly­ing — produces patterns of nature at the broadest scale, and therefore forges the relationships among higher taxa in our classifications. The force of adap­tation is secondary, disruptive, and subsidiary. It seizes individual lineages and pulls them from the main Sequence into side channels that always peter out as dead ends. This lower-level force produces the smaller units, the spe­cies and genera of our taxonomies.

Elusive vs. palpable. This last antinomy does not form part of La­marck's scheme, but becomes important in later interpretations, particularly in Darwin's refutation. The force of progress lies deeper within and operates at a higher level; the force of adaptation works palpably at the surface of things. One can, at least in principle, observe climates getting colder and ele­phants growing thick coats of fur in direct response; but advance up the lad­der lies further from our view in an abstract distance. Lamarck might have denied that the causes of progress posed any greater difficulty in recognition and observation; in his conceptual world, these forces arose from the chemi­cal nature of matter — and therefore became just as accessible as the immedi­ate causes of adaptation. But when Lamarck's theories of physical causa­tion collapsed, the force of progress became elusive — something operating so slowly, and at such high taxonomic levels, as to be effectively invisible in the here and now of testable science. Darwin based his theory upon a reformu­lation of this seventh antinomy — by arguing that palpable and immediate forces of adaptation did not oppose an inscrutable and untestable force of progress — but rather became the source of progress as well (and hence the only primary cause of all evolution) when extrapolated, by principles of uniformitarianism, into the immensity of time. All evolution therefore en­tered the realm of the testable.

Modern evolutionists may read this list with an odd feeling of deja vu — in the backward sense that we have already encountered all these issues in the modern debates of our own professional careers, but didn't know that our forebears had struggled over the same themes. Doesn't the late 20th cen­tury debate about micro and macroevolution raise the same questions about different causes at higher and lower taxonomic levels (the basis of Goldschmidt's argument, for example — see pp. 451–466); and don't extrapolationists still charge the defenders of higher level causality with proposing untestable theories of evolutionary change?

I do not find this persistence surprising at all (see Gould, 1977a). I have already cited (p. 58) A. N. Whitehead's famous remark that all later philosophy is a footnote to Plato. He did not mean to argue, by this statement, that no one (including himself) had thought anything new for more than two thou­sand years. Rather, he wished to defend the proposition that truly deep issues are few and not o obscure. The first great thinker should be able to lay out a framework and specify the primary questions. Later history must recycle the same issues, while offering new explanations in abundance (especially in em­pirical realms where truly novel information becomes available). Lamarck, for all his stubbornness and for all the idiosyncrasies of his theory, was a great thinker, and he did find a location for all major questions within his system. His theory therefore becomes a starting point, and later debate must engage the same issues. Given the central theorem of this book, I am especially gratified that Lamarck based the initiating system of our profession upon a theory of hierarchy — in a form that did not work, based on causes that we must reject for Darwin's good reasons; but a theory of hierarchy nonetheless. Evolutionary theory therefore set its roots, and cut its teeth, in the concept of hierarchical levels of causality.

An Interlude on Darwin's Reaction

In the flood of Darwinian scholarship unleashed after the centennial celebra­tions of 1959 and continuing unabated today, I regard no reform as more im­portant than the thorough debunking of the romantic myth that Darwin, alone and at sea, separated from the constraints of his culture, apprehended evolution as an objective raw truth of nature. This Galapagos myth, rooted in tortoises and finches, is demonstrably false in Darwin's particular case, and surely bankrupt as a general statement about human psychology and the soci­ology of knowledge.

Darwin saw many wonderful things on the Beagle; nature challenged him, broadened his view, and instilled flexibility. Darwin returned to England with the tools of conversion, but still as a creationist, however suffused with doubts and questions (Sulloway, 1982a; Gruber and Barrett, 1974; Schweber, 1977; Kohn, 1980; Desmond and Moore, 1991; Browne, 1995). As for the Galapagos, he had missed the story of the finches entirely, because he had been fooled by their convergences and had not recognized the underlying taxonomic unity (Sulloway, 1982b; Gould, 1985c). Darwin had been informed that the tortoises differed from island to island, but had failed to appreciate the significance of this claim. Naturalists then believed, falsely, that the Ga­lapagos tortoises were not indigenous but had been transported in recent memory by Spanish buccaneers and placed on the Galapagos as a source of food for revictualizing ships. Thus, Darwin must have reasoned, if the tor­toises had only been on the Galapagos for two or three centuries, differences among islands could not be consistent or meaningful. The Beagle had pro­visioned itself with several tortoises, stored live in the hold as meat on the hoof, so to speak. In a modern version of fiddling while Rome burned, Dar­win partook of the feasts but made no plea for conservation when his ship­mates then pitched the carapaces overboard.

Darwin became an evolutionist by returning to England and immersing himself in the scientific culture of London — by arguing with colleagues, by reading and pondering (mostly in the library of the Atheneum Club), by seek­ing good advice (learning from ornithologist John Gould, for example, that those diverse Galapagos birds were all finches). He exploited a broad range of humanistic Western culture in pursuing his struggle for intellectual reform in natural history. He read Plato, Milton, and Wordsworth. He constructed the theory of natural selection, as argued in the last chapter, in conscious analogy with the laissez-faire theories of Adam Smith and the Scottish economic school. Darwin, without the impetus and challenge of this intellectual envi­ronment, might have become a country parson, with a beetle collection main­tained by an ecclesiastical sinecure as the remnant of a childhood passion for natural history.

In this enlarged perspective on the origin of Darwin's evolutionary views, the importance of his precursors becomes greatly enhanced. Lamarck and Chambers* do not figure as irrelevancies to be ignored, or (even worse) as impediments to be overcome; they represent an essential part of his context for study, and they played a major role in shaping the radical and different char­acter of Darwin's distinctive theory.

I believe that Lamarck had a far greater influence on Darwin than tradition has allowed (a point advanced by other historians of science as well — see Corsi, 1978; Mayr, 1972, p. 90). I base this claim on Darwin's own contact with Lamarck's works, his private reactions as recorded in letters, and the eventual content of his theory. I don't claim that Darwin devised natural selection as a conscious point-by-point contrast or refutation of Lamarck, but I suspect that Darwin clearly recognized what he liked least in Lamarck and strove to formulate a theory of opposite import.

Darwin said little about Lamarck in his published works, with no explicit reference to Lamarck's evolutionary views in the first edition of the Origin, and grudging praise in the historical preface added to later editions. But we know that he studied Lamarck intensely, and didn't like what he read. Dar­win owned a copy of the 1830 printing of the Philosophie zoologique (see Hull, 1985, p. 802), and read the book while making heavy annotations at least twice. More important, perhaps, Lamarck had provided Darwin's intro­duction to evolution via Lyell's fair but critical exegesis in the Principles of Geology.

Lyell's characterization becomes particularly interesting because he empha­sizes, in his masterful prose, the very two points that Darwin would strive most mightily to correct. First, Lyell castigates Lamarck for making asser­tions without a shred of direct evidence. Note that Lyell directs his scorn not at the palpable forces of lateral adaptation, but at claims for the origin of new organs as increments of complexity wrought by the forces of progress:

We point out to the reader this important chasm in the chain of the evidence, because he might otherwise imagine that we had merely omitted the illustrations for the sake of brevity, but the plain truth is, that there were no examples to be found; and when Lamarck talks "of the effects of internal sentiment," "the influence of subtle fluids," and the "acts of organization," as causes whereby animals and plants may acquire new organs, he gives us names for things, and with a disregard to the strict rules of induction, resorts to fictions, as ideal as the "plastic virtue," and other phantoms of the middle ages (Lyell, 1832, p. 8).

Second, and more important for my argument, Lyell gives a crisp and accurate account of Lamarck's hierarchical view of evolutionary causality, emphasizing the contrast between the regular cause of progress, and the disrupting force of adaptation. The passage, worth quoting in extenso, probably repre­sents Darwin's first contact with this invalid style of hierarchical theory:

Nature is daily engaged in the formation of the elementary rudiments of animal and vegetable existence, which correspond to what the ancients termed spontaneous generations . . . These are gradually developed into the higher and more perfect classes by the slow, but unceasing agency of two influential principles: first, the tendency to progressive advancement in organization, accompanied by greater dignity in instinct, intelligence, etc.; secondly, the force of external circumstances, or of variations in the physical condition of the earth, or the mutual relations of plants and ani­mals ... Now, if the first of these principles, the tendency to progressive development, were left to exert itself with perfect freedom, it would give rise, says Lamarck, in the course of ages, to a graduated scale of being, where the most insensible transition might be traced from the simplest to the most compound structure, from the humblest to the most exalted degree of intelligence. But in consequence of the perpetual interference of the external causes before mentioned, this regular order is greatly inter­fered with, and an approximation only to such a state of things is exhib­ited by the animate creation, the progress of some races being retarded by unfavorable, and that of others accelerated by favorable, combina­tions of circumstances. Hence, all kinds of anomalies interrupt the conti­nuity of the plan, and chasms, into which whole genera or families might be inserted, are seen to separate the nearest existing portions of the series (Lyell, 1832, pp. 13-14).

Darwin's public silence (or mild approbation) is belied by his consistently negative attitude towards Lamarck, as recorded in private letters extending from the 1840's to post-Origin years. In 1844, he wrote to Hooker on the dearth of available evolutionary writing: "With respect to books on this sub­ject, I do not know of any systematical ones except Lamarck's, which is veri­table rubbish" (in F. Darwin, 1887, volume 2, p. 29). The most interesting post-Origin references occur in letters to Lyell, who criticized Darwin for not giving Lamarck sufficient credit. In responding to Lyell's first reaction to the Origin, Darwin wrote on October 11, 1859 (in F. Darwin, 1887, vol­ume 2, p. 215): "You often allude to Lamarck's work; I do not know what you think about it, but it appeared to me extremely poor; I got not a fact or idea from it." Perhaps, but I suspect that Darwin got many a concept against it.

Darwin's longest statement, a testy comment directed against Lyell's re­peated designation of Lamarck as a source (though mitigated at the end by Darwin's usual humor), conveys special insight in Darwin's stated rationale for rejecting Lamarck's theory so firmly:

Lastly, you refer repeatedly to my view as a modification of Lamarck's doctrine of development and progression. If this is your deliberate opin­ion there is nothing to be said, but it does not seem so to me. Plato, Buffon, my grandfather before Lamarck, and others, propounded the obvious view that if species were not created separately they must have descended from other species, and I can see nothing else in common be­tween the "Origin" and Lamarck. I believe this way of putting the case is very injurious to its acceptance, as it implies necessary progression, and closely connects Wallace's and my views with what I consider, after two deliberate readings as a wretched book, and one from which (I well re­member my surprise) I gained nothing. But I know you rank it higher, which is curious, as it did not in the least shake your belief. But enough, and more than enough. Please remember you have brought it down on yourself!! (in F. Darwin, 1887, volume 2, pp. 198-199).

Note the basis of Darwin's critique — "very injurious ... as it implies neces­sary progression." In other words, Darwin dismisses the higher-level cause of Lamarck's hierarchy. Darwin's own theory, of course, rested on the com­plete sufficiency, by extrapolation, of the lower-level force of adaptation in Lamarck's system (as produced by the different mechanism of natural se­lection).

Lamarck's hierarchical theory set a context (in opposition) for Darwin's distinctive single-level theory of extrapolation, based on uniformitarian assumptions, from the palpable and small-scale cases of adaptation that sur­round us to all evolutionary changes at all scales of time and magnitude. Nat­ural selection does not emerge from the raw observation of nature, but as a complex idea embedded both in observation and in Darwin's voracious study and trenchant analysis of contemporary ideas in biology and general culture. Lamarck's hierarchical theory formed an important, though not widely rec­ognized, part of the mix, distilled by Darwin to extract a theory that would change the world.

Darwin directed his anti-hierarchical theory against Lamarck's old and in­valid concept of hierarchy — different and opposed causes at distinct levels. Darwin labored mightily to encompass the entire domain of evolutionary causation within a single level — natural selection working on organisms. He knew what he wanted to do, and he pursued and extended the logic of his ar­gument relentlessly. Most of his supporters (including Wallace and Huxley) never understood the subtle logic of the single-level theory. Among the few who did, Weismann also made a strenuous effort to bring the system to com­pletion. I find the strongest historical support for modern versions of hierar­chy (same causes working in different ways at various levels, in direct con­trast with Lamarck's notion of disparate causes in opposition), in the intense intellectual struggle carried out by the two greatest selectionists of the 19th century — Weismann for lower levels, and Darwin himself for upper levels — to bring the nonhierarchical theory of selection to completion and sufficiency. Both men, as we shall see in the subsequent sections of this chapter, struggled valiantly, but could not prevail. (Chapter 5 will then discuss (in the saltationist context of his version) the other major hierarchical system of evolu­tionary thought before the Modern Synthesis — the fascinating and subtle early 20th century theory of de Vries on reintroducing selection at the species level after denying its central importance at Darwin's own level of the organ­ism.) Call it the bad penny that keeps cropping up, or the pearl of great price always found within, but hierarchy seems unavoidable. Could the basic rea­son for this persistence find an explanation in something so lovely, and so beautifully simple, as truth-value?

No Allmacht without Hierarchy: Weismann

on Germinal Selection

THE ALLMACHT OF SELECTION

In 1893, Herbert Spencer, who had a word (many of them) and a thought for nearly everything,* published a long critique in the Contemporary Review — "The Inadequacy of 'Natural Selection.'" He strongly supported the Lamarckian principle of use and disuse with inheritance of acquired charac­ters and, while not denying the importance of Darwin's principle, railed against the exclusivity claimed for natural selection by August Weismann and his school, variously labelled as "strict," or "ultra" or "neo" Darwinism. Weismann quickly rose to the challenge, choosing for his title a phrase that would become a motto for his approach. He called his rebuttal, in German, and parrying Spencer directly: Die Allmacht der Naturzuchtung — a title ren­dered by the English translator as "The All-Sufficiency of Natural Selection" (although I would prefer "Omnipotence," or the literal "All-Might").

This exchange (Spencer, 1893a and b; Weismann, 1893) became the focal point and most widely cited set of documents in the great debate between "neo-Darwinism" and "neo-Lamarckism," perhaps the hottest subject in evolutionary theory at the end of the 19th century (see Kellogg, who wrote, 1907, p. 134 — "The best known part of the general debate was that carried on directly by Weismann and Spencer in the Contemporary Review." These terms, as so often noted, bear little relation to the chief concerns of the name-bearers. Neo-Lamarckians bypassed Lamarck's central concept of materialis­tic progress and focused on a theory of heredity that Lamarck espoused as the folk wisdom of his day, not as anything distinctive in his system. Neo-Dar­winism referred to the panselectionism of Weismann and Wallace, an attitude explicitly and pointedly rejected by Darwin, who gave selection pride of place (hence the association), but granted other forces (including "Lamarckism") important, if lesser, roles in evolutionary change).

Passions ran high; I own Weismann's annotated copies of Spencer's articles, and his anger drips off the pages (Fig. 3-4). The two warriors thrusted and parried on both high and low roads, mixing some good arguments about the structure of evolutionary explanation with ad hominem charges of incompe­tence. Weismann (1893, p. 317) disparaged Spencer for being merely a phi­losopher, and not a true scientist: " [I] can only explain Mr. Spencer's ignoring such cogent instances by supposing that, as a philosopher, he is unacquainted with the facts by personal observation, and that therefore they appear less weighty to him than to a naturalist; for I would not for a moment suppose that he purposely evades the difficulties which face his opinion, as is the man­ner of popular orators and advocates — and alas! even of some scientists." Spencer, in his touché (1893, p. 23), replied, not entirely without justice as we shall see, that Weismann had hidden poor arguments under the cloak of au­thority as a practicing scientist: "Now it is doubtless true that as a naturalist he may claim for his 'opinion' a relatively great weight. Still, in pursuance of the method of science, it seems to me that something more than an opinion is required as the basis for a far-reaching theory."

This chapter explores the hints, inklings, and tentative formulations of hierarchical selection theory developed and published during Darwin's century. As a primary goal, I wish to bring to light the buried and forgotten discovery made by all strict Darwinians: that they could not carry through the logic of organismal selection to render all evolution without a crucial assist from se­lection at other levels. Hierarchy theory only became a major and explicit theme in evolutionary thought during the late 20th century, but a secret of history reveals that none of the great thinkers who struggled, with uncompro­mising respect for logic, to establish a general theory based on organismal se­lection alone could ever make the argument work without an appeal, some­times in frustration, to hierarchy.

Alfred Russel Wallace and August Weismann stand out as the two principal "neo-Darwinians" of the late 19th century, the men most strongly dedicated to the Allmacht of selection. They therefore become the test cases for my as­sertion that hierarchy cannot be avoided. I shall bypass Wallace, though he fits my claim that no pure selectionist could avoid hierarchy, because I find no

3-4. Weismann's personal copy (see his signature in upper right hand corner) of Spencer's reply to their first round of polemics. The two marginal comments on page 12 read (in translation of Weismann's German): "Impermissibly weak!" And (ironically): "As if that were certain!" (Author's collection.)

evidence that he ever clearly conceptualized the issue of levels in selection. Wallace felt entirely comfortable with selection on all levels (see Kottler, 1985) and never seemed to grasp either the logic of Darwin's central commit­ment to the organismal level, or the problems involved in claiming that selec­tion on other units (particularly higher "individuals") could be effective in the face of strong selection at the organismal level. Wallace maintained such an unshakable and primary commitment to the ubiquity of good design that he unhesitatingly invoked higher levels to preserve an argument for active se­lection whenever a focus on organisms raised the specter of nonadaptation (notably in his uncritical advocacy of species selection for sterility in interspe­cific crosses, rather than accepting Darwin's argument for infertility as a side consequence of accumulated differences in two diverging populations — see pp. 131–132).

But August Weismann represents the ideal test case for my assertion. Once he had declared war on "Lamarckian" inheritance, Weismann dedicated his professional life to promoting the Allmacht of selection. He grasped the logic of Darwin's argument in all its details and extensions. He recognized the centrality of selection on organisms, and he struggled to make Darwin's single-level theory work for all phenomena of evolution. His famous 1893 paper on the Allmacht of selection presents, as its central theme, an explicit defense for exclusivity of the organismal level — or "personal selection" in his terms.* Later, and largely in response to strong arguments made by Spencer, Weis­mann admitted that he could not rely on personal selection alone. He could continue to promote Allmacht only by recognizing another level of "germinal selection" for subcellular components of the germplasm.

Moreover, Weismann gradually extended the theory of germinal selection, from an ad hoc aid for personal selection (in the original formulation of 1895 and 1896) to a fully articulated theory of hierarchy replete with notions of independence and conflict between levels (1904 version). Finally, Weismann came to regard hierarchical selection as the linchpin and completion of his en­tire theory (see pp. 221–224) — though we have forgotten his cogent argu­ments, and usually depict him as the champion of conventional, organismic selection. Weismann's intellectual journey, his relentless probings and frequent reformulations, leading finally (and perhaps inexorably) to a full theory of hierarchy, provide an object lesson in the logic of evolutionary argument, and the needs imposed by completeness and coherence once we abandon the myopia of regarding "organized adaptive complexity" (Dawkins, 1986) as the only focus for evolutionary explanation (with all else arising by extrapolation therefrom).

WEISMANN'S ARGUMENT ON LAMARCK AND THE ALLMACHT OF SELECTION

I first learned about August Weismann in high school biology as the man who "disproved" Lamarckism by cutting off mouse tails for numerous genera­tions and noting the fully retained tails of all offspring (a good example of terrible teaching based upon the myth of crucial experiments as the source of all insight in science). Weismann did perform these experiments (1888, in 1891, pp. 431-461), but they (by his own admission) did little to combat Lamarckism, which is, as supporters parried, a theory about the inheritance of functional adaptations, not of sudden and accidental mutilations.

Weismann's strong anti-Lamarckian argument does not rest upon an experiment, or an empirical observation at all. The rejection of soft inheritance arises as a logical deduction from Weismann's most distinctive contribution — his theory of inheritance and the continuity of germ-plasm (1885, in 1891, pp. 163-256). If germ-plasm is "immortal" (by passage across generations) and soma-plasm limited in existence by the death of each multicellular organ­ism; and if germ-plasm is sequestered early in ontogeny ("locked away" as the guardian of posterity, and protected from all somatic influence); then Lamarckian inheritance becomes structurally impossible because acquired somatic adaptations cannot affect the protected germ plasm. Weismann wrote in his Allmacht paper (1893, p. 608): "Nature has carefully enclosed the germ-plasm of all germ-cells in a capsule, and it is only yielded up for the formation of daughter-cells, under most complicated precautionary con­ditions."

Once Lamarckian inheritance becomes impossible, Weismann's argument for the Allmacht of selection proceeds in four logical steps. This fourfold de­velopment will strike most modern scientists as curious and unsatisfactory, for the sequence not only requires no empirical contribution, but actively de­nies the possibility of effective input from this conventional source of scien­tific affirmation. The argument breaks no rules of logic, but several of its premises are (to say the least) not self-evidently true.

1. Adaptation is ubiquitous in nature; explaining adaptation therefore be­comes the chief goal of evolutionary theory. As "the greatest riddle that living Nature presents to us" (1909, p. 18), Weismann identified "the purposiveness of every living form relative to the conditions of its life, and its marvelously exact adaptation to these" (loc. cit.).

I believe it can be clearly proved that the wing of a butterfly is a tablet on which Nature has inscribed everything she has deemed advantageous to the preservation and welfare of her creatures, and nothing else (1896, p. 5).

Everything we see in animals is adaptation, whether of today, or of yesterday . . . Every kind of cell... is adapted to absolutely definite and specific functions, and every organ which is composed of these different kinds of cells contains them in the proper proportions, and in a particu­lar arrangement which best serves the function of the organ . . . The or­ganism as a whole is adapted to the conditions of its life, and it is so at every stage of its evolution" (1909, pp. 64-65. This statement comes from Weismann's contribution to the "official" centennial celebration of Darwin's birth. Thus, Weismann chose to honor Darwin by stressing panselection.)

2. Adaptation must be attributed either to some materialistic cause, or to teleology (in the classic sense of spiritually directed purpose). The validity of science depends upon our ability to supply explanations in the former mode.

3. Among materialistic proposals, only Lamarckism and natural selection can explain adaptation — for adaptation is ubiquitous and clearly too com­plex to ascribe to chance or to render as a side consequence of any process serving unrelated ends.

4. Since Lamarckism is logically impossible (under the doctrine of continu­ity of germ-plasm), selection must be correct. To assert the Allmacht of selec­tion, we need no evidence beyond the disproof of Lamarckism. In fact, given the complexities of nature, and our inability to reconstruct past conditions in detail, we probably could not supply adequate direct evidence in any sin­gle case.

We accept it, not because we are able to demonstrate the process in de­tail, not even because we can with more or less ease imagine it, but sim­ply because we must, because it is the only possible explanation that we can conceive. For there are only two possible a priori explanations of adaptations for the naturalist — namely, the transmission of functional adaptations [i.e. Lamarckism] and natural selection; but as the first of these can be excluded, only the second remains . . . We are thus able to prove by exclusion the reality of natural selection, and once that is done, the general objections which are based on our inability to demonstrate selec­tion-value in individual cases, must collapse, as being of no weight... It does not matter whether I am able to do so or not, or whether I could do it well or ill; once it is established that natural selection is the only princi­ple which has to be considered, it necessarily follows that the facts can be correctly explained by natural selection (1893, pp. 336-337).

In 1893, when he made this bold assertion to counter Spencer's claim for the "inadequacy of natural selection," Weismann advocated a kind of double exclusivity — for natural selection over Lamarckism, and for selection upon organisms as the only mode of Darwinian action. As a terminological matter, Weismann equated the general phrase "natural selection" with selection upon organisms alone ("personal selection" in his words. For example, he wrote (1903, vol. 2, p. 126): "It is upon this that the operation of natural selection, that is, personal selection, must depend"). However, spurred by Spencer's cri­tique, he soon expanded the boundaries of selection to include other levels of nature's hierarchy.

THE PROBLEM OF DEGENERATION AND WEISMANN'S IMPETUS

FOR GERMINAL SELECTION

As discussed in the last chapter, the primary and standard refutation of Dar­winism by late 19th century evolutionists held that natural selection could eliminate, but not create — and that some other factor must therefore be iden­tified to explain the origin of adaptations and species. For example, T. H. Morgan wrote in 1905, before he became a Darwinian: "It appears that new species are born; they are not made by Darwinian methods, and the theory of natural selection has nothing to do with the origin of species, but with the survival of already formed species" (in Kellogg, 1907, p. 95).

Darwinians, of course, understood this challenge, and responded with the argument that differential survivals, long cumulated, produce gradual and substantial changes meriting the designation "creative." Weismann himself, for example (1896, p. 1), spoke of "the opposition of our own day, which contends that selection cannot create but only reject, and which fails to see that precisely through this rejection its creative efficiency is asserted."

On this contentious question of creativity, several standard anti-Darwinian arguments invoked the earliest stages of features easily recognized as adaptive in their perfected form, for selection can preserve and accentuate a feature fully in place, but how can an organism move from an initial "there" to a fully functional "here"? Two claims predominated (see Mivart, 1871, for the classic statement that provoked Darwin's own response in later editions of the Origin): first, that initial steps are too small to provide any conceivable benefit in selection; and second, that earliest stages cannot initiate the final function in any sense (a bird cannot fly with 5 percent of a wing).

Darwinians developed satisfactory responses to both arguments about incipient stages of useful structures — the palpable value of tiny benefits for the first, and the principle of functional shift (preadaptation) for the second (see extensive discussion in Chapter 11, pp. 1218–1246). But the same problem seemed far more acute for the opposite dilemma of degeneration. Incipient stages of useful structures posed enough difficulties, although ultimate adaptiveness did suggest a Darwinian solution. But what conceivable pressure of natural selection could account for gradual stages in the disappearance of a functionless organ — for loss of function should remove a structure from the domain of selection entirely, and knowledge about an eventually adaptive state could not be invoked to guide an explanation for intermediary stages along such a functionless path.

(We might designate this problem by its classic example — the complete disappearance of eyes in some cave fishes. Despite a century of adequate Darwinian explanation, this issue continues to provide a rallying point for vernacular Lamarckism. I can testify to this in a personal way. As a result of writing more than 300 popular monthly essays on evolutionary topics during the past 25 years, I have become a statistically adequate sampling point, through thousands of letters received from lay readers, for both the fre­quency and intensity of standard confusions about our profession. I can tes­tify that three items top the list of puzzlement: (1) evolution seen as ana­genesis rather than branching ("if humans evolved from apes, why are apes still around"); (2) panselectionism ("what is the adaptive significance of male nipples"); and (3) Lamarckism and the failure of natural selection ("doesn't the blindness of cave fishes imply a necessary space for Lamarckian evolution by disuse").)

The problem of incipiency in degeneration poses more difficulty than the opposite issue of construction — for what can mediate the sequence if selec­tion does not regulate the final outcome? Weismann struggled to encompass this issue with his favored apparatus of Allmacht for selection — and he failed. Degeneration acted as the lever that pried Weismann from his panselec­tionism, and led him through a chronological series of honorable changes that must be read, in one sense, as retreats from a former pugnacious insis­tence on Allmacht, but that also represents a complexification and strength­ening of his original views.

Consider the example that Spencer raised with such effectiveness against Weismann, and that eventually prompted the theory of germinal selection — reduction of hind limbs in some whales to tiny vestiges with no exterior ex­pression at all. Two classical explanations had been invoked by panselectionists: (1) the limbs became so reduced by ordinary negative selection, as a consequence of the hindrances they imposed upon efficient, streamlined swimming; (2) the limbs are not, in themselves, harmful, but energy invested in any useless structure must handicap a creature relative to conspecifics with fewer vestiges and neutral organs.

Weismann invoked these standard arguments, but he became convinced (long before his debate with Spencer) that only part of the puzzle could be re­solved thereby. Selection would reduce the limbs to some degree (perhaps considerably), but surely the increments of further reduction soon become too small for granting a continuing, believable role to selection. Consider the figures that Spencer presents (1893b, p. 25), based on the efforts of a Dr. Struthers of Aberdeen, who had "kindly taken much trouble in furnishing the needful data, based upon direct weighing and measuring and estimation of specific gravity." Spencer cites a Greenland Right Whale, weight 44,800 pounds, femur weight, 3-1/2 ounces; and a Razorback at 56,000 pounds, with a femur weight of 1 ounce — "so that these vanishing remnants of hind limbs weighed but 1/896,000th part of the animal." Could one possibly be­lieve that a profound relative, but inconsequential absolute, reduction — from a two-ounce to a one-ounce femur, for example — might materially aid stream­lining (especially since external expression had disappeared long before) or conserve meaningful energy? Weismann accepted the implausibility of such a claim and recognized that he would have to seek an explanation beyond organismal selection for such late stages in the reduction of degenerate or­gans. "To use Herbert Spencer's striking illustration, how could the balance between life and death, in the case of a colossus like the Greenland whale, be turned one way or another by the difference of a few inches in the length of the hind-leg, as compared with his fellows, in whom the reduction of the hind-limb may not have gone quite so far? . . . Further reduction to their modern state of great degeneration and absolute concealment within the flesh of the animal cannot be referred even to negative selection" (Weismann, 1903, vol. 2, p. 114).

This example, and the general phenomenon of degeneration, deeply trou­bled Weismann because common sense seemed to demand that his Lamarckian bugbear and bogeyman — so recently and, as he thought, finally and effec­tively buried — be disinterred to explain reduction as inheritance of features shriveled by disuse. Spencer himself raised this example in order to defend a Lamarckian explanation prima facie:

Thus, the only reasonable interpretation is the inheritance of acquired characters. If the effects of use and disuse, which are known causes of change in each individual, influence succeeding individuals . . . then this reduction of the whale's hind limbs to minute rudiments is accounted for. The cause has been unceasingly operative on all individuals of the species ever since the transformation began. In one case see all. If this cause has thus operated on the limbs of the whale, it has thus operated in all crea­tures on all parts having active functions (Spencer, 1893b, p. 26).

Weismann first attempted to resolve the difficulties posed by degeneration with his hypothesis of panmixia (not the later Fisherian definition now famil­iar to evolutionists). By panmixia, Weismann referred to the effect of recom­bination in sexual reproduction (amphimixis in his vocabulary) upon organs no longer subject to selection. When selection operates, Weismann argued, organs will be actively maintained, with constant vigilance and no relaxation, at the peak of their potential size and complexity by elimination of individu­als bearing substandard parts. But as soon as selection ceases to act, formerly "substandard" attributes will no longer be eliminated; they now mix freely with "good" parts, and the organ slides, by continuous dilution, down an in­clined plane towards total elimination. In a poignant example (since poor eyesight plagued his own career), Weismann wrote (1903, pp. 114-115). "If this conservative action of natural selection secures the maintenance of the parts and organs of a species at their maximum of perfection, it follows that these will fall below this maximum as soon as the selection ceases to operate ... Those with inferior organs of vision will, ceteris paribus, produce as good offspring as those with better eyes, and the consequence of this must be that there will be a general deterioration of eyes, because the bad ones can be transmitted as well as the good, and thus the selection of good eyes is made impossible."

By his own admission and explicit defense (see p. 201), Weismann's argument for Allmacht, and against Lamarckian inheritance, rested upon a log­ical structure of inferences from premises, not upon observation — for an em­pirical approach, Weismann held, could not achieve resolution, given the impossibility of "seeing," at their minute sizes, the material bearers of hered­ity. Panmixia did compromise Allmacht in a sense, for this process yielded evolutionary change without selection. But following Kellogg's key distinc­tion of auxiliary from contradictory hypotheses (see pp. 163–169), panmixia worked as an adjunct and aid — a mopping-up operation for organs fallen below the purview of selection, and, more importantly, a moat to prevent the incursion of a true enemy, the antiselectionist forces of Neo-Lamarckism. (Lamarck battled against Darwin for the common ground of universal adap­tation, while panmixia only worked to finish what selection had started, and only in the limited domain of degeneration.)

But Weismann's panmixia, having no support beyond the internal logic of the argument itself, could not survive the detection and exposure of crucial flaws. Spencer was not the first writer to illustrate the weaknesses of pan­mixia, but the debate of 1893 does mark Weismann's last attempt to explain degeneration by panmixia alone, and therefore contains the seeds for his next and final attempt — the theory of germinal selection.

Spencer, referring to "the vexed question of panmixia" (1893b, p. 22), of­fered three major rebuttals. "When from the abstract statement of it we pass to a concrete test, in the case of the whale, we find that it necessitates an un­proved and improbable assumption respecting plus and minus variation; that it ignores the unceasing tendency to reversion; and that it implies an effect out of all proportion to the cause" (1893b, pp. 28-29). The second point, based on Galton's principle of regression to the mean, denies that "minus" varia­tions can continue to accumulate differentially; the third brands panmixia as too weak a force to secure the total elimination of a useless organ. The first argument, however, proved to be not only decisive in itself, but unusual in sci­entific discourse by accusing Weismann (correctly) of conflating linguistic us­age with biological reality.

Weismann continually argued that selection maintained an organ "at its highest level." Relaxation of selection might then impel an accumulation of previously eliminated variation in the minus direction only. But, as Spencer and others protested, why should selective optimization hold an organ at the summit of its potential size and complexity. Shouldn't optimality lie some­where in the middle of a possible range, with selective elimination of both plus and minus variations? "Take the case of the tongue," Spencer argued (1893b, pages 23-24). "Certainly there are tongues inconveniently large, and probably tongues inconveniently small. What reason have we for assuming that the inconveniently small tongues occur more frequently than the incon­veniently large ones?" Without the invalid metaphor of selective summits, panmixia cannot reduce an organ to oblivion, for release from selection does not impart an inexorably downward trend to preserved variation.

All these objections can be combined into a single claim, which Weismann found so compelling that he eventually surrendered panmixia as a fully adequate explanation of degeneration. Panmixia is a genuine, but weak, force; it can reduce the average value of an organ to a state somewhat below its for­mer functional size. But panmixia cannot solve the central question of degen­eration: what propels a useless organ all the way down the slide and into his­tory's dumpster? Weismann admitted his failure (1896, p. 22), and later summarized this ultimately unsuccessful episode in his quest to understand degeneration:

As my doubts regarding the Lamarckian principle grew greater and greater, I was obliged to seek for some other factor in modification, which should be sufficient to effect the degeneration of a disused part, and for a time I thought I found this in panmixia, that is, in the mingling of all together, well and less well equipped alike. This factor does cer­tainly operate, but the more I thought over it the clearer it became to me that there must be some other factor at work as well, for while panmixia might explain the deterioration of an organ, it could not explain its decrease in size, its gradual wearing away, and ultimate total disappear­ance. Yet this is the path followed, slowly indeed, but quite surely, by all organs, which have become useless (1903, vol. 2, p. 115).

Weismann therefore needed another kind of auxiliary hypothesis to pre­serve the Allmacht of selection against resurgent Lamarckism. He had tried the mechanics of inheritance as expressed in the doctrine of panmixia; now he would expand the domain of selection itself. He would depart from Dar­win's distinctive focus on struggle among organisms, and attempt to identify a source of directional variation in an analogous competition among determi­nants of heredity within germ cells — a "germinal selection." Weismann de­vised a truly ingenious argument: if natural selection can produce trends in the morphology of phenotypes, then an intracellular, germinal selection might yield directionality in the variation presented to conventional selec­tion upon organisms. If the determinants of a useless organ predictably lose in an intracellular struggle for existence, then a trend to complete elimina­tion — an apparent example of Lamarckian inheritance by the principle of dis­use — might still be attributed to selection. This new mechanism could not be equated with Darwinian selection upon struggling organisms, but "germinal selection" did represent a process of the same form and logic, but applied to replicating objects at a subcellular scale rather than to entire organisms.

Weismann first proposed the theory of germinal selection as a brief note in his last rebuttal to Herbert Spencer, thus marking Britain's Victorian pun­dit as a chief source (in reaction) to the first explicit theory of hierarchical selection. (Neue Gedanken zur Vererbungsfrage, eine Antwort an Herbert Spencer, Jena, 1895). Weismann then elaborated the theory in 1896 (pre­sented to the International Congress of Zoology at Leiden on September 16, 1895; first published in The Monist in January, 1896, then as a separate pamphlet, translated into English later that year). Weismann's fullest develop­ment, with some remarkable changes by extension, appeared in his most im­portant book, Vortrage iiber Descendenztheorie (1902), translated into English by J. Arthur and Margaret R. Thomson as The Evolution Theory in 1903. A comparison of the original 1896 version with the fullest exposi­tion of 1902 provides a fascinating exercise in itself, and also becomes a cru­cial argument for this book — for Weismann moved from a limited hypothe­sis proposed only as an adjunct to natural selection to a fully articulated theory of hierarchy, including concepts of independence and conflict between levels.

SOME ANTECEDENTS TO HIERARCHY IN GERMAN

EVOLUTIONARY THOUGHT

Germinal selection certainly finds its immediate source in Weismann's war with Lamarckism, his debate with Spencer, and his severe, longstanding dif­ficulty with the problem of degeneration. But Weismann's eventual embrace of hierarchy as an ultimate argument against Lamarckism also grew from a deeper foundation in German evolutionary thought. This lineage of argument is virtually unknown to English-speaking evolutionists, for the roots lie in the two most important untranslated documents of 19th century German evolu­tionary biology — the Generelle Morphologie (1866) of Ernst Haeckel and the Jugendwerk of a man who eventually made his considerable mark in an­other area of biology, Wilhelm Roux's (1881) Der Kampf der Theile im Organismus (The Battle of Parts in the Organism). Neither Haeckel nor Roux proposed a theory of causal hierarchy across levels of selection; both, in fact, spoke in the name of reductionism. Yet by denying, in very different ways, the exclusivity, or even the privileged status, of the organism as a causal agent in evolution, and by focusing attention on a structural hierarchy of lev­els, both Haeckel and Roux provided central ingredients to Weismann's the­ory of evolutionary hierarchy.

Haeckel's descriptive hierarchy in levels of organization

Generelle Morphologie der Organismen (1866), Haeckel's first book, repre­sents an eclectic mixture of militant reductionism and old-fashioned idealis­tic morphology; all united to an evolutionary theory every bit as idiosyn­cratic. (Haeckel dedicated volume two, jointly, to Darwin, Lamarck, and Goethe — and its central argument represents an odd fusion of their disparate ideas.) Haeckel's later notoriety rested almost entirely on the second volume, with its celebrated evolutionary trees (so often reproduced in modern text­books), based largely on his "biogenetic law," ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny (Gould, 1977b). The first volume, entitled "Allgemeine Anatomie" and dedicated to Carl Gegenbaur, has largely been forgotten. This first volume consists of two major parts, each attempting to establish a formal science for morphological study and each, following Haeckel's invariable practice, stud­ded with a baroque terminology of his own construction. (Haeckel, with a sure sense of what R. K. Merton (1965) would later call the eponymous strat­egy for renown, coined new terms shamelessly, recognizing (I suspect) that a few would probably hang on to bear his legacy (an r-selection approach to the courting of fame). The vast majority quickly succumbed to the negative selection of incomprehensibility, but survivors include ontogeny, phylogeny, heterochrony, ecology, and Monera.)

The second science, "promorphology," tried to establish a physical, or crystallographic basis for organic form. Haeckel created a forest of terms illustrated in two complex plates, but never established any useful connections with physical or chemical principles. (Haeckel promoted his much vaunted mechanistic reductionism more by verbal proclamation than by deed, but the influence of a well-articulated philosophy consonant with social trends of an age must never be doubted.) The first science, "tectology," tried a different approach to reductionism — not subsumption under physical laws, but break­down to component parts.

As the "basic principle" of tectology, Haeckel stated that all organic ob­jects must be built from components in a structural hierarchy of six ascending levels. But, in applying this pronouncement to actual cases, Haeckel makes a fascinating intellectual move, proving that his allegiance lay as much with ho­listic traditions of an older idealistic morphology, as with the militant physi­cal reductionism that won his lip service and fit with many of his social and political goals (Gasman, 1971). For Haeckel did not argue, in the manner of most 19th century reductionists, that his first and lowest level stands as fun­damental and basic (also "closer" to physics), with subsequent levels only treated as amalgamations based on principles of joining. Instead, Haeckel proclaimed a form of equality among the six levels (while not denying the compositional theme that lower units join to build higher entities). He re­ferred to tectology as the "doctrine of organic individuality" (Lehre von der organischen Individuality), and insisted that the objects at each of the six levels be designated as "individuals" in their own right — "individuals of the first order," "individuals of the second order," etc. He placed "plastids" (cells and cell components) on the first rung, organs (including tissues and organ systems) on the second, antimeres or Gegenstiicke (symmetrical parts, includ­ing rays or body halves of bilateral creatures, literally "counterparts") on the third, metameres or Folgestucke (body segments, literally "following pieces") on the fourth, persons (or vernacular "individuals") on the fifth as "morphologische Individuen funfter Ordnung," and colonies or "corms" on the sixth and last plane.

This equalization of status prompted the interesting consequence, with reference to natural selection, of denying to organisms their privileged Darwin­ian role as exclusive evolutionary agents. Natural selection surely ascribed evolutionary change to a struggle among individuals for reproductive success. But Haeckel insisted that objects at all six levels counted as "individuals," and that no level could claim any special status as evolutionary agent. Organ­isms represent only one waystation in the ascending hierarchy. Perched on the fifth rung, they are made of metameres and aggregate into corms — just as or­gans are made of plastids and aggregate into antimeres. In an insightful state­ment on the role of language in prejudicing thought, Haeckel wrote of his fifth level (1866, vol. 1, pp. 318-319):

An unbiassed and more deeply probing conception of organic individu­ality shows that these "true" or absolute individuals are, in fact, only rel­ative . . . Although these "true" individuals are, in most higher plants and coelenterates, only the subordinate components of a higher-standing unity (the colony), nonetheless the individuality of humans and higher animals leads us to the erroneous conception that morphological indi­viduals of the fifth order are the "true" organic individuals. This concept has become so general, and has been so strongly fixed in both scientific and vernacular consciousness, that we must mark it as the major source of the numerous and varied interpretations and debates that prevail on the subject of organic individuality.

Haeckel's concept of structural levels and the non-distinctive status of or­ganisms entered Weismann's argument in two crucial places — first, very gen­erally, when Weismann used the same style of thinking to establish a hierar­chy of (hypothetical) entities as the physical bearers of heredity within germ cells (see p. 214); and, second, quite specifically, when Weismann invoked Haeckel's six-part hierarchy (1896, p. 42) to argue that the struggle for exis­tence starts within germ cells, but then extends up through all Haeckelian cat­egories to colonies at the top.

Roux's theory of intracorporeal struggle

Wilhelm Roux's Der Kampf der Theile im Organismus evoked a wide range of reactions. Roux's teacher, Gustav Schwalbe, warned him against ever pub­lishing such a "philosophical" book again. Haeckel, another teacher, liked the work for its consonance with his own ideas, while Darwin himself, during the last year of his life, became greatly intrigued, writing to G. J. Romanes on April 16, 1881:

Dr. Roux has sent me a book just published by him ... It is full of rea­soning, and this in German is very difficult for me, so that I have only skimmed through each page; here and there reading with a little more care. As far as I can imperfectly judge, it is the most important book on Evolution which has appeared for some time ... Roux argues that there is a struggle going on within every organism between the organic mole­cules, the cells and the organs ... If you read it, and are struck with it (but I may be wholly mistaken about its value), you would do a public service by analyzing and criticizing it in 'Nature' (in F. Darwin, 1887, vol. 3, p. 244).

(Note how, contrary to the prevalent historical myth of the aged Darwin as the reclusive "sage of Down," he actually (and actively) kept his ears alert, and his fingers right on the pulse of evolutionary debate. Romanes repre­sented just one among several younger colleagues and supporters whom Dar­win often recruited, both overtly and nonsubtly, to carry forth his interests in both the public and the professional arena.)

Obviously, Roux had adopted Darwinian language for his title. Just as obviously, he hoped to apply the Darwinian apparatus at a level below its conventional locus of organisms. Roux's book surely occupies a place in the history of hierarchy theory, if only because its verbal image of struggling parts led many evolutionists, notably Weismann himself, to consider multiple levels of selection. But, curiously, as several critics soon noted (Plate, 1905; Kellogg, 1907; and even, with some ambiguity, Weismann, 1904, as well), Roux's the­ory does not really treat descent at all. Weismann's germinal selection, as we shall see, is a true theory of suborganismal selection and inheritance; but Roux's battle of the parts includes no statement about heredity, and ranks in­stead as a theory of functional adjustment in development.

Roux argued that the construction of a harmonious and well-designed organism emerges from a struggle among parts competing for limited nutri­ment. Lung cells compete with liver cells, and bone cells battle with other bone cells for best locations in the flow of nutriment. To cite Roux's favorite example, made even more famous by D'Arcy Thompson's later analysis (1917, and see Chapter 11, pp. 1195–1196), the bony trabeculae in the head of a hu­man femur form a virtual diagram of forces imposed on the bone during loco­motion, and must therefore be optimally designed to counter stress. But no one can argue that details of the arrangement in any single bone represent an evolutionary adaptation, if only because the trabeculae of a broken, and im­properly mended, femur reform along the new stress lines of a limping walk.

Roux argued that stresses establish lines of preferred flow for nutriment. Bone cells that happen to lie in the stream prosper and proliferate; others in less advantageous positions wither and die — leading to a functional honey­comb of struts and empty spaces. Roux used this argument to explain the functional design of tissues and organs in general, but he focused upon such complex and exquisite examples of optimal form as the barbules on bird feathers, the hairs that cover the spiracles of many insects, the arrangement of muscle fibers in the walls of blood vessels, and the bony trabeculae discussed above.

This "battle of the parts" may account for the flexible construction of opti­mal form in each organism. Indeed, such a principle, appropriately modern­ized, remains essential for a developmental biology that cannot invoke a specially tailored gene for each villus on an intestinal surface. But Roux's pro­posal cannot operate as a theory of evolutionary change for two reasons. First, the struggling parts do not vary in heritable ways, and victory cannot lead to beneficial changes in future generations. Bone cells that prosper on the growing trabeculae cannot be designated as superior to, or even in any sense intrinsically different from, the losing cells that die for lack of nutriment in the spaces between. The winners owe their success only to the good fortune of a favorable location. Kellogg (1907, p. 207) wrote: "This competition de­pends chiefly on the hazard of position ... Not the best qualified but the best situated fibers have vanquished the others by robbing them of food and thus finally destroying them." Second, Roux's Kampf der Theile includes no theory about inheritance. No matter how exquisite or optimal the outcome for any one organism, the results of the struggle cannot be imparted to offspring. (The capacity for functional adaptation might, of course, be heritable and might evolve by ordinary natural selection, but Roux never discusses this quite different issue.)

Weismann reacted to Roux's theory in a complex and ambiguous manner. He always credited Roux as an antecedent of germinal selection (a reasonable attribution, if only because an explicit metaphor of struggling parts can direct another scientist's thinking to a truly selectionist theory, even if the original proposal operated in a different domain). Weismann, particularly in his early work, seems to credit Roux — incorrectly — as a true suborganismal selection­ist: "Functional adaptation is itself nothing else than the efflux of intrabiontic selective processes" (1896, p. 15). Roux's theory, he argues in several passages, rests upon a variational base, and is therefore Darwinian.

But, by 1904, Weismann had recognized that Roux's suborganismal strug­gle could not operate as a theory of evolutionary change: "There is an essen­tial difference between personal and histonal selection, inasmuch as the latter can give rise to adaptive structural modifications corresponding to the needs of the tissue at the moment, but not to permanent and cumulative changes in the individual elements of the tissue" (1904, volume 1, p. 248). "No one will be likely to suppose that the distorted position of the spongiosa of a badly healed fracture could reappear in the straight bone of a descendant" (ibid., p. 251).

Moreover, Weismann added, even the metaphorical linkages of Roux to Darwin cannot be logically sustained. Most of Roux's examples do not in­clude competition among members of the same cell population (as in bone cells within the developing femur), but between entirely different organs: liver cell with lung, or kidney or heart. This process cannot be viewed as a struggle for existence at all, but only as a sorting out of different "species" into their appropriate places: "The struggle for existence and for descendants, in this case, is between two kinds of cell which were different from the beginning, and of which one has the advantage at one spot, another at another" (1904, volume 1, p. 248). Weismann then drew a striking analogy* between different tissues in an organism, and different species of birds in a broad geograph­ical region:

The case may be compared to that of a flock of nearly allied species of bird, of which one species thrives best in the plains, another among the hills, and a third among the mountain forests, all mingled together in a vast new territory to which they had migrated, and in which all three kinds of conditions were represented. A struggle would arise among the different species, in which in every case the particular species would be victorious which was best adapted to the local conditions ... This would be the result of a struggle between the three species, not between individ­uals within each species, and it could not therefore bring about an im­provement of a single species, but only the local prevalence of one or an­other (1904, volume 1, pp. 248-249).

Weismann's strong and valid critique of Roux leaves us with a puzzle: why did Darwin, who understood the nature of selection so much better than any­one else (see next section), become so intrigued with Roux's book, if Kampf der Theile does not really develop a selectionist, or even a truly evolutionary, theory at all? Several resolutions may be suggested. Most mundanely, Darwin was no German scholar, and he may not, as he himself suggested to Romanes, have properly understood the theory in his cursory reading. Secondly, Darwin was not a strict selectionist, and may simply have valued Roux's insights on functional adaptation, including the Lamarckian implications for a theory of heredity by extension. But, in a third and intellectually more intriguing hy­pothesis, perhaps Darwin valued Kampf der Theile for two genuine benefits or consonances that Roux's book granted to natural selection — one practical, the other metaphorical.

In a practical sense, Roux explicitly provided the resolution of a paradox that had plagued natural selection — the problem of too much adaptation ("organs of extreme perfection" in Darwin's designation in Chapter 6 of the Origin). Can we really believe that organismal selection constructs each barbule on every feather — even with the immensity of geological time and the hecatomb of deaths in each generation? Roux offered Darwin a sensible exit from such an untenable implication: selection builds the capacity for an auto­matic functional response that can directly shape each organism in minutely adaptive ways during growth: "Through the capacity of the struggle of parts, a much higher perfection, the purposefulness of the functioning part down to the last molecule, can arise, and occur much more rapidly, than if it had to originate, by the Darwin-Wallace principle, through selection of variation in the struggle for existence among individuals" (Roux, 1881, p. 239).

But Roux offered even more, by way of metaphor, to Darwin's cardinal vision — the paradox of higher stability arising through struggle among lower elements. Functional adaptation might not rank as an evolutionary theory, but such a process does produce internal order within a body by struggle — just as natural selection engenders the external harmonies of adaptive design and ecological balance: "As the struggle of parts [Kampf der Theile] yields purposefulness within an organism ... so does the analogous struggle for ex­istence [Kampf urn's Dasein] among individuals yield purposefulness with re­spect to external conditions of existence" (Roux, 1881, p. 238). Roux also echoed Darwin's most general and most important philosophical principle:

To many, the direction of this book may well seem very strange — for it holds that, in an animal, in which everything is so exquisitely ordered, in which all the different parts interlock with such excellence, and work to­gether in such perfected coordination, that a struggle of parts occurs, so that in one place, where everything works together according to firm principles, a conflict among the individual parts exists. But how can an entity [ein Games] exist, whose parts are at variance? ... How shall the good and the stable arise from struggle and battle?... All good can only arise from struggle [alles Gute nur aus dem Kampfe entspringt] (1881, p. 64).

Darwin himself could not have penned a better epitome for his most radical claim.

GERMINAL SELECTION AS A HELPMATE TO PERSONAL

SELECTION

Weismann proposed the theory of germinal selection as a logical solution to the problem of degeneration in a non-Lamarckian world. But germinal se­lection only makes sense under Weismann's concept of inheritance — yet an­other theory of structural hierarchy, and explicitly linked by Weismann to Haeckel's 6-fold sequence as a further breakdown and elaboration (for germ plasm) of categories within Haeckel's lowest unit of "plastids," or cellular constitutents (1896, p. 42).

In Weismann's admittedly hypothetical system, the fundamental sub-microscopic particles of heredity are called "biophors." Biophors aggregate to "determinants," the key unit for the theory of germinal selection. The logic of panselectionism requires a high degree of easy dissociability among genetic "particles" responsible for "traits" that can be individually optimized to con­struct well-adapted organisms — for if "particles" become too tightly linked or coordinated, then each change entails too many consequences for other traits, and constraints begin to prevail over adaptation. "Determinants" play this necessary role in Weismann's panselectionist theory of heredity. Each de­terminant builds an organ or a particular part of the body — in other words, an "item" of the phenotype that selection can mold independently.

Determinants, like their constituent biophors, are invisible and hypotheti­cal. They aggregate into the first observable unit, the "id" — an earlier use of a term that Freud coopted for a much different role and purpose (just as pale­ontologists had coined and developed a meaning for "mutation" (Waagen, 1869) before the new science of genetics outcompeted us with a later and altogether different definition). Each id contains a determinant for every trait, and can therefore build a body. Weismann identified ids with the disk-like microsomes, recently observed as linearly ordered on chromosomes. The chromosomes themselves, or "idants" in Weismann's system, carry ids in rows, and stand atop the hierarchy of hereditary units.

Germinal selection rests upon the notion that determinants within germ cells may be analogized to organisms within habitats. Just as organisms strug­gle for limited resources (and not all can survive), determinants battle for the restricted flow of nutriment available to any cell. The winners grow and pro­liferate; the losers wither or disappear entirely. The strength of determinants governs the phenotypic expression of their resulting trait. Thus, if the deter­minants of a particular trait decrease or wither by germinal selection within cells, the trait will suffer in expression by exhaustion of its molecular base.

Weismann viewed germinal selection as an analog to interspecific struggle, rather than to competition among members of a single population — that is, determinants for one organ battle for limited nutriment with determinants for other parts of the body. But, unlike Roux's Kampfder Theile, Weismann's germinal selection does operate as a theory of altered heredity, and therefore as a potential evolutionary mechanism — for determinants weakened by ger­minal selection not only build a diminished body part; they also pass fewer (and debilitated) offspring determinants to germ cells of the next generation.

The ingenuity of this argument lies in its capacity to take the most serious potential challenges to the Allmacht of selection — a group of overt phenom­ena that seem to lie outside the possible control of organismal selection, and therefore within the domain of Lamarckism or orthogenesis — and to reinter­pret them as consequences of selection acting at a lower level. For if organis­mal selection can produce directional trends in phenotypes during geological time, then germinal selection can forge trends in strengthening or weaken­ing determinants (and their phenotypic expressions) across generations. The gradual and unidirectional shriveling to oblivion of an organ not subject to personal selection certainly suggests Lamarckian inheritance and evolution­ary loss by disuse; but if we descend a level and peer within the germ cells, we may envision (though we cannot directly see) a constant competition and se­lection among determinants, with losers paying the usual price of gradual and inexorable elimination. The Allmacht of strict Darwinism may be sacrificed, as organismal selection loses its exclusivity; but selection itself remains pre­eminent by expansion:

Powerful determinants in the germ cell will absorb nutriment more rap­idly than weaker determinants. The latter, accordingly, will grow more slowly and will produce weaker descendants than the former . . . Since every determinant battles stoutly with its neighbors for food, that is, takes to itself as much as it can, consonantly with its power of assimila­tion and proportionately to the nutriment supply, therefore the unimpoverished neighbors of this minus determinant will deprive it of its nu­triment more rapidly than was the case with its more robust ancestors (1896, p. 24).

Weismann offered the same pugnacious defense for germinal selection that he had long championed for the Allmacht of organismal selection; the argu­ment must hold, lest we be driven either to mysticism or to the patently false Lamarckian mechanism:

No one who is unwilling to accept germinal selection can be compelled to do so, as he might be to accept the Pythagorean propositions. It is not built up from beneath upon axioms, but is an attempt at an explanation of a fact established by observation — the disappearance of disused parts. But when once the inheritance of functional modifications has been dem­onstrated to be a fallacy ... he who rejects germinal selection must renounce all attempt at explanation. It is the same as in the case of per­sonal selection. No one can demonstrate mathematically that any varia­tion possesses selection value, but whoever rejects personal selection gives up hope of explaining adaptations, for these cannot be referred to purely internal forces of development (1903, volume 2, p. 121).

Weismann, at least for public consumption, insisted that germinal selection represented the advancing wave of triumphant Neo-Darwinism. (In the late 19th century, "Neo-Darwinism," a term coined by Romanes, referred to the panselectionist school of Wallace and Weismann, not to the pluralism of Dar­win himself. The modern meaning, associated with the evolutionary synthesis of the 1930's and onward, is not genealogically linked to this earlier defini­tion.) Many critics responded by charging that this invisible process repre­sented little more than an ad hoc hypothesis invented to save selection from the otherwise unexplainable phenomenon of degeneration. Kellogg (1907) provided, I believe, the most balanced perspective. He labelled germinal selec­tion as "a new and radically un-Darwinian theory" (1907, p. 134) — recog­nizing that Darwin's own theory of "natural selection" specified organisms as the locus of selection. But he respected the theory, recognized its similarity with the selectionist logic of classical Darwinism, and regarded germinal se­lection as a credible attempt to explain, in expanded Darwinian terms, the apparently un-Darwinian property of directional variation. He wrote: "Obvi­ously Weismann in his theory of germinal selection has preserved the ac­tuality of the struggle and the selection, but with a 'rehabilitation' of natural selection in the real Darwinian meaning and only fair application of the phrase, the new theory has nothing to do. It is, much more, a distinct admis­sion of the inadequacy of natural selection to do what has long been claimed for it. It is the first serious attempt at a causomechanical explanation of a theory of orthogenesis, that is, variation along determined lines" (Kellogg, 1907, p. 199).

I particularly value Kellogg's interpretation because the logic of his argu­ment correctly represents, in my view, the relationship of modern hierarchical selection theory to classical Darwinism and to the Modern Synthesis as well. Hierarchy should be viewed as an expansion of Darwinism in its continuing reliance on selection as the primary mechanism of evolutionary change. But, at the same time, hierarchical selection does not merely extend Darwin's exclusively organismal version in a simple, comfortable, or inexorable manner. Rather, in fracturing Darwin's reliance on organisms as evolutionary agents, and in rendering evolutionary variation and change by interaction among lev­els, the theory of hierarchical selection introduces enough conceptual novelty, and disperses enough inadequate orthodoxy, to rank as a new, and in some respects radical, formulation, rather than a fully comfortable expansion.

Kellogg also grasped the weaknesses of germinal selection (which, of course, would soon become irrelevant when the codification of Mendelism disproved Weismann's conjecture about the physical mechanism of heredity). He asked (1907, pp. 200-201) (1) why measured variation so often con­formed to a normal distribution if germinal selection could act so powerfully to promote directional variation; (2) why species generally displayed such geological stability if germinal selection provided such a strong mechanism for orthogenesis; and (3) why, if determinants wage such constant battle, each against all others, severe deprivation of food often produced a proportion­ately dwarfed organism, rather than a creature lacking phenotypic expression for particular losing determinants in such intensified struggle.

Weismann originally developed germinal selection to explain the disappearance of degenerate organs, once he recognized that panmixia could only yield a partial reduction. But he soon expanded the scope of his new theory into the domain of positive selection as well, hoping to resolve thereby most of the remaining dilemmas in classical Darwinism. The main promise of germinal selection lay in its capacity to explain a phenomenon that could scarcely be more inconvenient for Darwinism — directed variation. Darwin had emphasized the "random" or undirected character of variational raw material as a prerequisite for advocating natural selection as the cause of evo­lutionary change (see previous discussion of this crucial principle on pp. 144–146). For directed variation, if sufficiently powerful, would demote natural selection to a negative force for eliminating the unfit (while the fit arise auto­matically by differential variation), and a minor accelerator of trends origi­nating for internal reasons (since random mortality can sustain an evolution­ary direction imparted by biased variation).

But germinal selection could now explain directed variation by differential survival of struggling components within germ cells. Weismann therefore made a sweep through evolutionary problems that might be resolved by his new and selectionist theory of directed variation. In his original formulation of 1896, Weismann identified three possible roles for germinal selection in positive adaptation.

1. Fleeming Jenkin (1867) had troubled Darwin with his analogy of poten­tial variation within a species to a rigid glass sphere. Selection could be effec­tive along any radius, but the movement of a modal form from center to surface exhausted all possible variation, and positive selection must there­fore damp itself to oblivion before achieving any substantial change. But, Weismann argued, germinal selection of successful determinants establishes a highway for new variation, and any positive natural selection can automati­cally engender, by germinal selection, a wave of increasing variation ahead of the advancing mean.

2. Spencer (1893a and b) had invested his major defense of Lamarck in the phenomenon of co-adaptation. How could natural selection, working sepa­rately on each trait, produce an intricate coordination of numerous parts, all changing in the same direction? But Weismann now argued that any positive organismal selection will strengthen the determinants of all traits involved, thereby triggering a coordinated trend in germinal selection. Co-adaptation becomes less puzzling if all positively selected traits achieve such a strong boost from germinal selection: "As soon as utility itself is supposed to exer­cise a determinative influence on the direction of variation, we get an insight into the entire process and into much else besides that has hitherto been re­garded as a stumbling block to the theory of selection ... as, for example, the like directed variation of a large number of already existing similar parts, seen in the origin of feathers from the scales of reptiles" (1896, p. 39).

3. In his furthest extension — a remarkable claim given his previous faith in the Allmacht of purely organismal selection — Weismann now argued that any intricately precise adaptation probably requires a boost from germi­nal selection to reach a pinnacle of exquisite design. Writing of mimicry in Lepidoptera, he argued:

It would have been impossible for such a minute similarity in the design, and particularly in the shades of the coloration, ever to have arisen, if the process of adaptation rested entirely on personal selection ... In such cases there can be no question of accident, but the variations presented to personal selection must themselves have been produced by the princi­ple of the survival of the fit! And this is effected, as I am inclined to be­lieve, through such profound processes of selection in the interior of the germ plasm as I have endeavored to sketch ... under the title of germinal selection (1896, p. 32).

This list, while granting broad scope and power to the newly formulated domain of suborganismal struggle, also illustrates the strictly limited concep­tual role that Weismann envisaged for germinal selection when he first formu­lated the concept in 1895 and 1896. The action of germinal selection must al­ways be synergistic with conventional organismal selection. In degeneration, the "type" example if you will, germinal selection "finishes off" what natural selection began but could not complete. In all other cases of evolutionary construction (maintenance of variation, co-adaptation, and "extreme perfec­tion"), germinal selection works hand in hand with organismal selection, ei­ther to supply positive variation, or to accelerate change by supplying an im­petus in the same direction from another level.

Over and over again, Weismann emphasizes the purely synergistic action of germinal with organismal selection. Thus, for example, ordinary natural se­lection can initiate the decline of an organ rendered useless by environmental change. In fishes that have migrated into dark caves, organismal selection against eyes must lead to differential survival of animals with weakened de­terminants for these organs. Once debilitated, these determinants continue to lose battles of germinal selection, and phenotypic expression sinks below the threshold that organismal selection could regulate: "In short, only by this means are the determinants of the useless organ brought upon the inclined plane, down which they are destined slowly but incessantly to slide towards their complete extinction" (1896, p. 25).

The case for synergism becomes even clearer when selection acts for the increasing complexity of an organ — for the two levels need not engage in a relay, but may now work continuously together in the same direction. Organ­ismal selection favors a stronger part, thereby preserving organisms with more powerful determinants for the part, and unleashing a necessarily synergistic germinal selection: "As soon as personal selection favors the more pow­erful variations of the determinant ... at once the tendency must arise for them to vary still more strongly in the plus direction . . . From the relative vigor or dynamical status of the particles of the germ plasm, thus, will issue spontaneously an ascending line of variation, precisely as the facts of evolu­tion require" (1896, p. 27).

Weismann explicitly identified this inherent and automatic synergism as a major insight, and a logical completion of his argument for the Allmacht of selection. Noting "the harmony of the direction of variation with the require­ments of the conditions of life" (1896, p. 38), Weismann continues: "The de­gree of adaptiveness which a part possesses itself evokes the direction of vari­ation of that part. This proposition seems to me to round off the whole theory of selection and to give to it that degree of inner perfection and com­pleteness which is necessary to protect it against the many doubts which have gathered around it on all sides like so many lowering thunderclouds . . . The principal and fundamental objection that selection is unable to create the variations with which it works, is removed by the apprehension that a germi­nal selection exists." And, more succinctly for the centennial of Darwin's birth, Weismann reduced this theme to a celebratory aphorism (1909, p. 39): "Germinal selection supplies the stones out of which personal selection builds her temples and palaces: adaptations" — thus amalgamating the synergistic link of levels, the Allmacht of selection, and the primacy of adaptation (as re­corded in a metaphorical linkage with the noblest of buildings, both spiritual and temporal).

GERMINAL SELECTION AS A FULL THEORY OF HIERARCHY

Weismann had granted an important role to germinal selection in his initial formulation, but he had not yet developed a full theory of hierarchy, for germinal selection could only walk the same paths established by ordinary natural selection — at most accelerating or intensifying the journey. But when Weismann wrote the major book and summation of his later career, Vortrage iiber Descendenztheorie (1902; English translation, 1903), he devoted two full chapters to germinal selection and, without explicitly acknowledging the change or extension, radically altered his conception into a full selectionist theory of hierarchy, the first such proposal in the history of evolutionary thought.

Taking an opposite tack from his original formulation, Weismann now proposed to define the scope of germinal selection by what such a process could accomplish without and beyond organismal selection: "We shall at­tempt to gain clearness as to what it can do, and how far the sphere of its in­fluence extends, and, in particular, whether it can effect lasting transforma­tions of species without the cooperation of personal selection, and what kind of variations we may ascribe to it alone" (1903, vol. 2, p. 126).

Weismann now recognized that he could use germinal selection to escape the straitjacket of Panglossian adaptation. He could finally admit the non-adaptive character of some phenotypic features without straying from the Allmacht of selection, or giving comfort to Lamarckism — for traits arising by germinal selection may be neutral or even harmful to survival in the Dar­winian world of competition among organisms. Weismann recognized two classes of nonadaptive features potentially ascribable to germinal selection.

Neutral features of small or no importance. Since germinal selection can promote changes invisible to organismal selection, Weismann wondered whether such minor variations as human racial differences — attributed by Darwin to sexual selection based on disparate standards of beauty arising for capricious reasons in various societies — might actually arise as effects of germinal selection: "It cannot be denied that there are char­acters which have no special biological significance [although] ... it is dif­ficult and often impossible to point these out with certainty. The shape of the human nose and the human ear, the color of the hair and the iris, may be such indifferent characters whose peculiarities are to be referred solely to germinal selection" (1903, vol. 2, p. 134).

Orthogenetic drives that may yield harmful features and even lead to extinction. In a remarkable departure from the al­most strident panselectionism of his earlier years, Weismann now approved certain claims for orthogenesis, and admitted the existence of harmful trends (based on directionality in variation) that organismal selection could not re­verse. He even accepted the classic examples of the anti-Darwinian schools as orthogenetic and harmful prima facie — the antlers of Irish Elks, and the mas­sive canines of saber-toothed cats (1903, vol. 2, p. 139). He embraced the best cases of his opponents because germinal selection — once he reversed his original view and grasped its power to work against organismal selection — could convert these enemy troops to the doctrine of Allmacht. For when ger­minal selection acts with sufficient power, then all the determinants favored by organismal selection may be eliminated entirely, leaving only the vigorous determinants of harmful orthogenetic features, and rendering conventional selection impotent for lack of raw material: "In this case the variation-direc­tion which had gained the mastery in all ids could no longer be sufficiently held in check by personal selection, because the variations in the contrary di­rection would be much too slight to attain to selective value" (1903, vol. 2, p. 139).

Following the early 20th century vogue for eugenics, Weismann used this argument to promote a positive program of breeding to save the human race. Germinal selection must be responsible for any decline of the human stock engendered by relaxation of natural selection — for panmixia lacks sufficient strength to produce such an effect, while Lamarckian inheritance does not ex­ist. This orthogenetic deterioration by germinal selection can only be reversed by a reimposition of Darwinian competition in the organismal mode, with re­productive success to the victors. Arguing that military service might operate as a good filter for identifying bodies well suited for success in organismal se­lection, Weismann suggested (1903, vol. 2, p. 147): "It would indeed be well if only those who had gone through a term of military service were allowed to beget children" (thus adding another example to the compendium of social nonsense advanced by prominent evolutionists in the name of Darwinism — see Chapter 7, and Fisher, 1930).

But, far more important than merely extending the domain of germinal selection to explain potentially nonadaptive organismal traits, Weismann also enlarged the conceptual realm of levels in selection from a narrow mechanism for synergism to a full theory of hierarchy. Weismann had now worked his way through the logic of multi-level selection theory, and had recognized the two key ingredients of any full account.

Independence of levels and potential for conflict. The attribution of orthogenesis to germinal selection implies that suborganismal selection can act separately from conventional Darwinian selection, and even work in a contrary direction to decrease phenotypic adaptation. Thus, the process that Weismann had originally promoted to make natural selection even more effective had become, by honest probing into all corners and impli­cations of the argument, a separate cause that could work either with or against the canonical Darwinian mode. In fact, Weismann now argued that potential independence from the Darwinian level of organismal selection es­tablishes the primary significance for germinal selection in evolutionary the­ory (1903, vol. 2, p. 119): "In this fact lies the great importance of this play of forces within the germ-plasm, that it gives rise to variations quite indepen­dently of the relations of the organism to the external world. In many cases, of course, personal selection intervenes, but even then it cannot directly ef­fect [sic, and correctly; he means 'cause,' not just 'affect'] the rising or falling of the individual determinants — these are processes quite outside of its influ­ence."

In his most revealing change, Weismann even reinterprets his type case of degeneration. He had previously tried to explain degeneration as a result of germinal selection completing a process that natural selection had started but could not finish. Now, without any change in evolutionary mechanics, he speaks of germinal selection working differently and independently. He even claims that degeneration offers the purest case for potential independence of levels — for germinal and organismal selection usually act together, thus ren­dering their individual contributions operationally inseparable. But we know that organismal selection has disappeared in the final stages of degeneration, and we can therefore observe the unsullied action of germinal selection alone! "In one direction variation can be proved to go on without limit, and that is downwards, as is proved by the fact of the disappearance of disused organs, for here we have a variation-direction, which has been followed to its utmost limit, and which is completely independent of personal selection; it proceeds quite uninterfered with by personal selection, and is left entirely to itself" [Weismann's italics] (1903, vol. 2, p. 129). At England's major centennial cel­ebration of Darwin's birth, Weismann presented an even stronger statement (1909, p. 38): "Useless organs are the only ones which are not helped to as­cend again by personal selection, and therefore in their case alone can we form any idea of how the primary constitutents behave, when they are subject solely to intragerminal forces."

Such independence of levels implies potential conflict, with stability achieved through balance, or by the victory of one level. Natural selection, as a powerful force operating directly on phenotypes, usually prevails in its own domain of visible form. If germinal selection weakens a useful organ, natural selection can intervene in an antagonistic mode (except in degenera­tion, where natural selection ceases to act, and germinal selection reigns un­checked). "If a struggle for food and space actually takes place, then every passive weakening must lead to a permanent condition of weakness and a lasting and irretrievable diminution in the size and strength of the primary constituent concerned, unless personal selection intervenes, and choosing out the strongest among these weakened primary constituents, raises them again to their former level. But this never happens when the organ has become use­less" (1903, vol. 2, p. 122).

Similarly, if germinal selection initiates an orthogenetic trend, natural selection can impose a halt by eliminating organisms with traits exaggerated beyond utility, thereby removing their positive determinants from the germinal population. (This basic antagonism, Weismann finally concluded in his stron­gest recognition of potential conflict between levels, may be virtually omni­present in nature, and therefore fundamental to evolution, because positive organismal selection almost always elicits an upward trend in determinants by Weismann's earlier argument for synergism. Most stable species may not be quiescent with respect to selection, but balanced by a policing of germinal selection with opportune removals based upon Darwinian organismal com­petition.) "In the majority of cases the self-regulation which is afforded by personal selection will be enough to force back an organ which is in the act of increasing out of due proportion to within its proper limits. The bearers of such excessively increased determinants succumb in the struggle for existence, and the determinants are thus removed from the genealogical lineage of the species" (1903, vol. 2, p. 130).

But germinal selection can also triumph, and such victories may not be infrequent in nature. All orthogenetic and nonadaptive traits may record the potency of suborganismal processes in conflicts between levels of selection: "All excessive or defective hereditary malformations may be referred to ger­minal selection alone, that is, to the long-continued progressive or regressive variation of particular determinant-groups in a majority of ids" (1903, vol. 2, p. 138).

Expansion of the hierarchy both up and down from a Darwinian focus on organisms. Weismann devised germinal se­lection as an ad hoc hypothesis to resolve his longstanding embarrassment over the problem of degeneration. In 1896, he applied selection throughout Haeckel's hierarchy of "individuals," extending from cell constitutents to clonal colonies (1896, p. 42), and recognizing three primary levels — Darwin's conventional struggle for existence among organisms, Roux's histonal selec­tion, and his own germinal selection.

But by 1903, in a statement that I regard as wonderfully prophetic of cur­rent concerns, Weismann had proceeded beyond his immediate theoretical needs to full generality. He had used germinal selection to break through the Allmacht of exclusivity for Darwin's level. But now he recognized the inexo­rable logic of a fully developed and extended theory of hierarchy — reaching right up to species selection at the top.

I have called these processes which are ceaselessly going on within the germ-plasm, Germinal Selection, because they are analogous to those processes of selection which we already know in connection with the larger vital units, cells, cell-groups and persons. If the germ-plasm be a system of determinants, then the same laws of struggle for existence in regard to food and multiplication must hold sway among its parts which hold sway between all systems of vital units — among the biophors which form the protoplasm of the cell-body, among the cells of tissue, among the tissues of an organ, among the organs themselves, as well as among the individuals of a species and between species which compete with one another (1903, vol. 2, p. 119).

If Weismann had presented this full elaboration of hierarchy only as a foot­note, a flash of insight in a book devoted to other goals, I could not claim him as an intellectual forebear of our modern excitement. Good ideas originate in fair abundance, and we must look to development and application for our main criteria of sustained scientific worth. If Weismann had even devoted an isolated chapter to hierarchy, I would note his insight with praise, but grant him limited success for failing to recognize the power of this theme as an or­ganizing framework for evolutionary mechanisms. But, in fact, Weismann did fully grasp the fundamental difference between classical Darwinism and the expanded theory of interacting levels of selection — and he regarded his expo­sition of hierarchy as both the central feature of his mature thinking, and the unifying concept of all evolution: "This extension of the principle of selection to all grades of vital units is the characteristic feature of my theories; it is to this idea that these lectures lead, and it is this — in my own opinion — which gives this book its importance. This idea will endure even if everything else in the book should prove transient" (1903, in preface, vol. 1, p. ix).

How ironic that a man who so explicitly promoted the centrality of hier­archy should be remembered today primarily for his earlier advocacy of Allmacht at the traditional level of organismal struggle alone! A study of Weismann's intellectual ontogeny should lead us to respect the logic and power of hierarchy, whatever our eventual judgment about merit and utility. Weismann, by far the most thoughtful of Darwinians in the first generation after the founder himself, could not "cash out" the exclusivity of organismal selection when he pushed the theory to the edges of its necessary application. He then invented an auxiliary theory of suborganismal selection to rescue himself from an uncomfortable corner; but he eventually followed the relent­less logic of his own argument to a full theory of hierarchy.

The theory of hierarchical selection does not constitute either a small and merely incremental nuance, or a modern concoction and exaggeration of bored Darwinians trying to stir up some trouble. Hierarchy has accompanied the theory of selection from its very inception — if only because no truly tena­cious and thoughtful Darwinian could ever avoid its appeal and logic, while at least one of the wisest and the most committed adherents, August Weis­mann, came to regard hierarchy as the implied and necessary centerpiece of any evolutionary theory fully rooted in selectionist principles, and truly com­prehensive in explanatory range. We have largely forgotten Weismann's intel­lectual journey today. But we should recover his chain of argument — for his motives and insights retain full validity, even if later discoveries about the physical basis of heredity invalidated his particular form of suborganismal selection.

Hints of Hierarchy in Supraorganismal Selection: Darwin on the Principle of Divergence

DIVERGENCE AND THE COMPLETION OF DARWIN'S SYSTEM

Charles Darwin cannot be judged as a consistently felicitous writer, but he could turn a phrase with the very best of craftsmen. As noted before, many of his lines, particularly his wonderful metaphors, have become parts of our cul­ture — the image of the "entangled bank" at the very end of the Origin, or the "tree of life" that closes Chapter 4 on natural selection. His posthumously published autobiography contains many memorable and oft-quoted state­ments, including his description of intellectual eureka: "I can remember the very spot in the road, whilst in my carriage, when to my joy the solution oc­curred to me" (in F. Darwin, 1887, vol. 1, p. 84).

Poll our biological colleagues, and most will tell you that this horse-drawn epiphany describes Darwin's Malthusian insight of September 1838, and the resulting formulation of natural selection. But the passage refers to a much later event, and this error of attribution may be the most common in all Dar­winian exegesis. The statement recounts an insight — the "principle of diver­gence" in his own description — that Darwin ranked as equal in importance with natural selection itself, an idea whose formulation sometime in the early to mid 1850's (the true date of the carriage ride) allowed him to complete his theoretical structure and begin writing his magnum opus.

Darwin describes the phenomenon that a principle of divergence must resolve, and states his surprise at his own obtuseness before the fateful car­riage ride:

But at that time [after the Malthusian insight of 1838 and his composi­tion of the sketches of 1842 and 1844] I overlooked one problem of great importance; and it is astonishing to me, except on the principle of Columbus and his egg,* how I could have overlooked it and its solution. The problem is the tendency in organic beings descended from the same stock to diverge in character as they become modified. That they have di­verged greatly is obvious from the manner in which species of all kinds can be classed under genera, genera under families, families under sub­orders, and so forth (in F. Darwin, 1887, vol. 1, p. 84; the carriage state­ment directly follows).

Darwin (loc. cit.) then epitomizes the solution that he named "the principle of divergence" and ranked with natural selection as a foundation of his theory: "The solution, as I believe, is that the modified offspring of all dominant and increasing forms tend to become adapted to many and highly diversified places in the economy of nature."

Darwin's principle of divergence has puzzled many biologists: why did Darwin rank the concept so highly, and as a principle separate from natu­ral selection? May we not view divergence as a logical consequence or sim­ple spin-off from natural selection itself? Yet when one considers the issue in Darwin's terms, both his separation of divergence from natural selection, and his joy in resolution, make excellent sense. Natural selection, as formu­lated under the Malthusian insight of 1838, states a principle of anagenetic change within phyletic lines — an argument about adaptation to local cir­cumstances (biotic and abiotic). This principle says nothing, by itself, about diversification, or splitting of one lineage into two or several descendant taxa. So much of what Darwin needed to explain — plenitude in ecology, branching models in phylogeny, the hierarchical structure of taxonomy, to name just a few items of obvious centrality — rested upon the fact of diversi­fication, not adaptation (see Mayr, 1992, on Darwin's several theories of evo­lution).

One might say — indeed many of us do say, thus leading us to downgrade and misinterpret Darwin's explanation of diversity — that "divergence of character" requires no separate principle beyond adaptation, natural selec­tion, and historical contingency. After all, the earthly stage of evolution pro­vides ecological and biogeographical prerequisites for diversification. Cli­mates alter; topography changes; populations become isolated, and some, adapting to modified environments, form new species. What more do we need? Insofar as Darwin considered the issue at all between 1838 and the early 1850's, his thinking followed this general line (Sulloway, 1979; Ospovat, 1981). But Darwin grew dissatisfied with a theory that featured a general principle to explain adaptation, but then relied upon historical acci­dents of changing environments to resolve diversity. He decided that a fully adequate theory of evolution required an equally strong principle of diversity, one that acted intrinsically and predictably. If adaptation and diversification specify the central phenomena of evolution, each must have its principle, and their union would then define his complete theory.

(In modern evolutionary parlance, we may relate the growing intensity of Darwin's search for a general, "law-of-nature" explanation of divergence to his changing views about allopatric and sympatric speciation. During the 1840's, when diversity did not greatly trouble him as a theoretical issue, Dar­win tended to view speciation as allopatric, and therefore as a consequence of historical accidents in geography and ecology. When a population becomes spatially isolated, he reasoned, natural selection can act independently upon it, and eventually accumulate enough divergence from the ancestral form to establish a new species. But Darwin's preferences then shifted to sympatric views of speciation — and he therefore developed a conviction that some gen­eral law, and not just historical accidents of isolation, must promote the mul­tiplication of species. A complete theory of natural selection required that this elusive "law" of speciation or divergence also be based on the predictable op­eration of organismic selection. In the light of our current preferences for allopatric speciation, Darwin's shift may seem ironic, but our opinions and certainties, as presently defined, must be deemed irrelevant to such historical analysis.)

In the context of this book and its principal theme of hierarchical selection, I stress the centrality of Darwin's changing views on divergence because I think that I have made a small discovery about the structure of his argument. I shall try to show that this most brilliant of all theorists, this rigorously hon­est thinker who worked so diligently to explain all evolution as a conse­quence of organismic struggle, tried mightily to render his second touchstone, his "principle of divergence," by ordinary natural selection — and he failed. He could not succeed because the logic of his argument demands a major role for sorting and selection at the species level — and Darwin, with characteristic honesty, faced his distress head on.

I am fascinated that the exegetical literature on Darwin's attitude to supra-organismal selection (Ghiselin, 1974; Ruse, 1980, for example) has focused entirely on putative cases of group selection (sterility in plant hybrids; neuter castes in Hymenoptera) and has quite properly concluded that Darwin, with a possible exception for invoking family or clan selection to explain human moral traits, doggedly and consistently carried through his program for the exclusivity of organismic selection (see Chapter 2, pp. 125–137). In so doing, these scholars have missed the one area — the heart of Darwin's argument about diversity — where his logic falters because he needs (but hesitates to em­brace in his distress) the apparatus of species selection. I suspect that the in­ternal problems in this centerpiece of Darwin's thought have not been ad­dressed, or even recognized, because species selection itself did not become a subject of importance (or even an acknowledged subject at all) until recently, while debate about conventional group selection has long raged. Darwin has therefore been well combed for comments about interdemic selection, while his main engagement with supraorganismal selection on species went un­noticed.

In any case, whatever our attitude or ignorance today, Darwin clearly regarded his solution to the problem of divergence as his second great achieve­ment (after natural selection), and as the capstone to his theory. As Ernst Mayr notes (1985, pp. 759-760): "He referred to it always with great excite­ment, as if it had been a major departure from his previous thinking." On June 8,1858, Darwin wrote to Hooker after completing his extended discus­sion of the principle of divergence for Chapter 6 of Natural Selection (the "big species book" that would never be completed because Wallace's paper, arriving within 10 days of this letter to Hooker, derailed his leisurely plans and led him to compose the "abstract" (in his own description) that we call The Origin of Species). "I am confined to the sofa with boils," he begins, "so you must let me write in pencil." He then goes on to describe "the 'Principle of Divergence,' which, with 'Natural Selection,' is the keystone of my book" (in F. Darwin and Seward, 1903, volume 1, p. 109).

A year before, in September 1857, Darwin wrote his first complete account of the principle of divergence in a famous letter to Asa Gray at Harvard University. Gray had explicitly asked Darwin for an epitome of his evolution­ary theory (previously revealed only to Darwin's closest confidants, Hooker and Lyell in particular): "It is just such sort of people as I that you have to sat­isfy and convince and I am a very good subject for you to operate on, as I have no prejudice nor prepossessions in favor of any theory at all" (quote in Kohn, 1981, p. 1107). Darwin responded positively with a lucid summary of his theory in six points:

• The power and effect of artificial selection.

• The even greater power of natural selection working on all characters at once and over vastly longer spans of time.

• The operation of natural selection at the organismal level, powered by the Malthusian principle that all species produce far more offspring than can possibly survive.

• A description of how natural selection works in nature.

• A defense of gradualism as the solution to standard problems in accept­ing the factuality of evolution.

• An explication of the principle of divergence.

This account of the principle of divergence also became the first published version because Lyell and Hooker included this letter to Gray among the documents published in the Linnaean Society's journal for 1858 — the "delicate arrangement" that presented Darwin and Wallace jointly, stressing Darwin's priority but publishing Wallace's paper on the independent discovery of natu­ral selection in toto. Darwin's sixth point neatly summarizes his ideas on di­vergence:

Another principle, which may be called the principle of divergence, plays, I believe, an important part in the origin of species. The same spot will support more life if occupied by very diverse forms. We see this in the many generic forms in a square yard of turf, and in the plants or in­sects on any little uniform islet, belonging almost invariably to as many genera and families as species. We can understand the meaning of this fact amongst the higher animals, whose habits we understand. We know that it has been experimentally shown that a plot of land will yield a greater rate if sown with several species and genera of grasses than if sown with only two or three species. Now, every organic being, by prop­agating so rapidly, may be said to be striving its utmost to increase its numbers. So it will be with the offspring of any species after it has be­come diversified into varieties, or sub-species, or true species. And it fol­lows, I think, from the foregoing facts, that the varying offspring of each species will try (only a few will succeed) to seize on as many and as di­verse places in the economy of Nature as possible. Each new variety or species, when formed, will generally take the place of, and thus extermi­nate its less well-fitted parent. This I believe to be the origin of the classi­fication and affinities of organic beings at all times; for organic beings al­ways seem to branch and sub-branch like the limbs of a tree from a common trunk, the flourishing and diverging twigs, destroying the less vigorous — the dead and lost branches rudely representing extinct genera and families (from the 1858 published version, often reprinted, as, for example, in Barrett et al., 1987).

Darwin continually awarded his principle of divergence the central role specified in this letter to Gray. Nearly half of the key chapter in the Origin of Species (number 4 on "Natural Selection") treats the principle of divergence, closing with the celebrated metaphor of the tree of life, sketched out at the end of point 6 to Gray. The only figure in the entire Origin of Species occurs in chapter 4. The intent of this famous diagram (reproduced here as Fig. 3-5 on p. 242) has almost always been misunderstood by later commentators. Darwin did not draw this unique diagram simply to illustrate the generality of evolutionary branching, but primarily to explicate the principle of diver­gence.

After more than a century in limbo, Darwin's principle of divergence has been exhumed and subjected to careful scrutiny by historians of science. No subject in Darwinian studies has been more actively pursued during the past 25 years, and many excellent analyses have been published on the genesis and utility of the principle of divergence (Limoges, 1968; Sulloway, 1979; Browne, 1980; Schweber, 1980, 1985, 1988; Ospovat, 1981; Kohn, 1981, 1985). Therefore, the importance of this principle has finally been recognized. Ospo­vat, for example, writes (1981, pp. 170-171): "Darwin's 'principle of diver­gence' [is] the most important addition to his theory between 1838 and 1959 [sic, for 1859] and the one most intimately associated with the transforma­tion of his theory after 1844." In all this literature, however, only Schweber has grasped Darwin's difficulties with divergence as an unresolved struggle between levels of explanation. Yet this theme, particularly Darwin's inability to "cash out" his usual argument about organismal struggle at the level of species birth and death, holds, I believe, the key to Darwin's treatment.

Darwin's argument about divergence begins with an unquestioned premise that strikes us as curious today (for we are immediately tempted to mount a challenge), but resonates with a central theme of Darwin's century — the clear and inherent "good" of maximizing the amount of life in any given region, and the consequent necessity for a cause to insure this natural goal. Maximi­zation, Darwin argues, arises by diversification: the more taxa in a given area (and the more different), the greater the total quantity of life. This theme can be traced to Darwin's earliest "transmutation notebooks" of the 1830's, the primary documents of his quest to formulate evolution: "The end [that is, goal] of formation of species and genera is probably to add to quantum of life possible with certain pre-existing laws — if only one kind of plant not so many" (C Notebook, p. 146 — in Barrett et al., 1987).

In the fullest discussion within Natural Selection (written in early 1858), Darwin firmly links maximization of life to diversification of taxa: "I con­sider it as of the utmost importance fully to recognize that the amount of life in any country, and still more that the number of modified descendants from a common parent, will in chief part depend on the amount of diversification which they have undergone, so as best to fill as many and as widely different places as possible in the great scheme of nature" (p. 234 of Stauffer edition, 1975).

Darwin proposes that the vague concept of "amount" or "maximization" of life be quantified chemically as total metabolic flow through a given area in a given time — and he illustrates the primary dependence of this quantity on diversification:

The fairest measure of the amount of life [is] probably the amount of chemical composition and decomposition within a given period. Imagine the case of an island, peopled with only three or four plants of the same order all well adapted to their conditions of life, and by three or four insects of the same order; the surface of the island would no doubt be pretty well clothed with plants and there would be many individuals of these species and of the few well adapted insects; but assuredly there would be seasons of the year, peculiar and intermediate stations and depths of the soil, decaying organic matter etc., which would not be well searched for food, and the amount of life would be consequently less, than if our island had been stocked with hundreds of forms, belonging to the most diversified orders (ibid., p. 228).

Darwin then provides examples from agriculture and domestication. Sev­eral varieties of wheat, sown together on a plot, will yield more grain per acre than a monoculture. In one experiment, two species of grass yielded 470 plants per square foot, while a plot of 8 to 20 species produced a thousand plants per square foot (ibid., p. 229): "I presume that it will not be disputed that on a large farm, a greater weight of flesh, bones, and blood could be raised within a given time by keeping cattle, sheep, goats, horses, asses, pigs, rabbits and poultry, than if only cattle had been kept" (ibid., p. 229).

But why was Darwin so wedded to a principle of maximization that would strike most of us today as both metaphysical and indefensible (ecosystems, af­ter all, can work perfectly well with far fewer species and lower chemical "yield" per spot)? Schweber (1980), I think, has provided the correct answer by stressing Darwin's allegiance to one of the most popular philosophical ap­proaches of his day — the "Benthamite optimization calculus" promoted by Jeremy Bentham, and many other prominent thinkers in several disciplines, as the utilitarian principle in philosophy and political economy, the "greatest good for the greatest number." William Paley, the intellectual hero of Dar­win's youth (see p. 116), spoke for a utilitarian consensus in writing (quoted in Schweber, 1980, p. 263): "The final view of all rational politics is, to pro­mote the greatest quantity of happiness in a given tract of country ... and the quantity of happiness can only be augmented by increasing the number of percipients or the pleasure of their perceptions." In other words, make more objects and make them better. Nature achieves this desired maximization and progress by diversifying the number of species in each region of the globe.

Darwin explicates and defends the maximization of life with his favorite rhetorical device — analogy — and by invoking another fundamental tenet in the political economy of his era: the division of labor. As taxa specialize ever more precisely to definite and restricted roles in local ecologies, more species can be supported (leading to maximization of life as measured by chemical throughput). In a note of September 23, 1856, Darwin drew a direct parallel between diversification in nature and the economic principle of division of la­bor: "The advantage in each group becoming as different as possible, may be compared to the fact that by division of labor most people can be supported in each country." For the public presentation in the Origin three years later, Darwin retained the centrality of division of labor, but chose a biological analogy drawn from the French zoologist Henri Milne Edwards (who had, himself, credited Adam Smith and the political economists, and who charac­terized his own view as an extension of their principle):

The advantage of diversification in the inhabitants of the same region is, in fact, the same as that of the physiological division of labor in the or­gans of the same individual body — a subject so well elucidated by Milne Edwards. No physiologist doubts that a stomach by being adapted to di­gest vegetable matter alone, or flesh alone, draws most nutriment from these substances. So in the general economy of any land, the more widely and perfectly the animals and plants are diversified for different habits of life, so will a greater number of individuals be capable of there support­ing themselves (Darwin, 1859, pp. 115-116).

Consider the form of the classic argument in Darwin's two analogical sources. Adam Smith began the Wealth of Nations by discussing pinmaking to illustrate the advantages of division of labor. Smith states the basic argu­ment in the very first words of his classic book: "The greatest improvement in the productive powers of labor, and the greater part of the skill, dexterity, and judgment with which it is anywhere directed or applied, seem to have been the effects of the division of labor." Pinmaking, Smith tells us, may be "a trifling manufacture," but "18 distinct operations" are still needed to make the final product. If a single worker performed all these tasks, he "certainly could not make twenty" pins in a day, but allocation of separate tasks to 10 people (with some individuals continuing to perform 2 or 3 of the 18 opera­tions) allowed one small factory to make 48,000 pins per day, or 4800 per man. Now who benefits from this division of labor? In part, the workers who hone their skills and participate in the resulting prosperity. But primarily the larger polity — the factory through profits, or society itself in the availability of moderately priced goods. Similarly, in Milne Edwards' physiological divi­sion of labor, the prime beneficiary cannot be the organ (an omnivore's stom­ach works perfectly well qua stomach), but again the larger polity, in this case the organism.

Applying the same logic to Darwin's analog, the beneficiary of life's diversification through division of labor is not the individual, or even the species, but the larger polity — or life itself through the principle of maximization. Thus we can grasp the link between division of labor as a pervasive structural principle, and Darwin's goal in application — the summum bonum of maximi­zation of life, achieved through division of labor with the larger polity, or life itself, as the beneficiary.

The logic in this chain of reasoning also illustrates why the coupling of maximization with division of labor cannot validate Darwin's "principle of divergence." These arguments may indicate why maximization should occur, but do not explain how such a plenteous state of nature arises. In other words, this chain of reasoning does not propose a cause for maximization. Above all else, Darwin clearly understood that his distinctive style of evolu­tionary argument demanded an explanation for any higher level phenome­non as a consequence of struggle among individual organisms for reproduc­tive success. Maximization and division of labor represent phenomenological statements about the constitution of life and ecology not claims about the efficient causes of diversity. Such statements provide, in other words, a basic description of diversity, but emphatically not a "principle of divergence." Darwin's insight in his carriage did not merely systematize the notions of maximization and division of labor; Darwin had known and used these con­cepts for years. The transforming insight — the argument worthy of being called a "principle of divergence" and becoming a keystone of his entire evo­lutionary theory — occurred when Darwin recognized how he could apply his distinctive style of argument, based on organismal selection, to the higher-level phenomenology of diversity. In other words, the "principle of diver­gence" embodies Darwin's argument for how and why ordinary natural selec­tion must, as a predictable consequence, yield divergence of character, leading to multiplication of successful taxa, extinction of others, ecologic plenitude, maximization of life, and the hierarchical structure of taxonomy.

THE GENESIS OF DIVERGENCE

This perspective on the jelling of Darwin's principle of divergence resolves a recent debate among historians about the timing and reason for Dar­win's formulation. Proposals for timing have ranged from the late 1840's to 1858, with cardinal inspirations from biogeography (Sulloway), systematics (Limoges, Ospovat), the "botanical arithmetic" of chapter 2 in the Origin, leading Darwin to defend the greater evolutionary potential for diversifi­cation in large genera (Browne), inspiration from the arguments of politi­cal economy (Schweber) and switch from allopatric to sympatric models of speciation (Kohn). All these influences surely played their parts, for the prin­ciple of divergence calls upon a wide and complex range of convictions, spanning many years and much turmoil in Darwin's mind. But Darwin's for­mulation and formalization of the "principle of divergence" records his con­viction, and his great pleasure, that he could encompass all these ideas as predictable consequences of natural selection working by struggle among organisms — that he could, in other words, bring all the higher-level phenom­enology of maximization, division of labor, and so forth, into his own distinc­tive explanatory framework.

Schweber dates the first full formulation to 1856 and writes (1988, p. 135): "That Darwin had the 'keystone' of the argument by January 1855 is proba­bly correct, but I would also suggest that the argument was still not com­plete in an important way — at least insofar as an explicit presentation is con­cerned. All the arguments up to that point referred to levels of descriptions above individuals: varieties, species, and higher taxa. Natural selection oper­ated on individuals, and the linkage by which diversity is accomplished had to be explicitly stated." Using this insight, Schweber regards the fol­lowing note of September 23, 1856, as the first explicit formulation.* Just as unfettered individual competition yields the best social order in Adam Smith's world, so too will natural selection among organisms lead to max­imization by division of labor: "The advantage in each group becoming as different as possible, may be compared to the fact that by division of labor most people can be supported in each country. — Not only do the individuals in each group strive against the others, but each group itself with all its members, some more numerous, some less, are struggling against all other groups, as indeed follows from each individual struggling" (Dar­win, September 23, 1856, cited in Schweber, 1988). (This consistent stress on the role of individuals as primary causal agents also characterizes the writings in political economy that so influenced Darwin. For example, I omitted by ellipsis an intermediary passage in the statement from Smith quoted above on p. 124. It reads: "Although we speak of communi­ties as sentient beings; although we ascribe to them happiness and misery, desires, interests, and passions; nothing really exists or feels but individu­als. The happiness of a people is made up of the happiness of single per­sons.")

This proper characterization of Darwin's argument also overturned the most sensational charge ever based on the principle of divergence, and made with such attention in the public arena by Brackman (1980) — the claim that Darwin received Wallace's paper from Ternate earlier than the "official" date (June 18,1858), and then proceeded to steal the principle of divergence from him, thus formulating his complete theory by ripping off Wallace and cover­ing up the evidence. This charge, which can only be supported by ignorance of detail (see the analysis of Kohn, 1981), falls apart once we recognize Dar­win's full principle of divergence as an explanation of maximization by natu­ral selection through division of labor. Darwin clearly formulated this com­plete argument in 1856, and sent a lucid epitome to Asa Gray in 1857. Thus, a possible receipt of Wallace's paper earlier in June, or even in late May of 1858, cannot affect this chronology.

Brackman, of course, does not deny these facts. He must therefore claim that Darwin had been spooked by Wallace for years, that he pinched the ini­tial idea of diversification from Wallace's 1855 paper, and that he then moved faster (and stealthily) when the firmer statement arrived in 1858. But if we turn to Wallace's 1855 paper, we note that this article contains nothing relevant to a principle of divergence properly defined as a set of complex arguments for linking natural selection on organisms with the phenomenol­ogy of higher levels of biological organization. At most, Wallace's 1855 paper includes a passing description of the simple property of divergence itself — a fact well recognized by Darwin, who had been noting the centrality of this theme since the transmutation notebooks of the late 1830's (see quote on p. 229). (We shall also see, at the close of this section (p. 248), that even Wallace's 1858 paper contains only a cursory statement about divergence with no hint of the central feature of bridging levels.) Brackman has con­fused the noting of a fact with the development of an explanation. He has also failed to recognize Darwin's long awareness of the fact and its impor­tance.

DIVERGENCE AS A CONSEQUENCE OF NATURAL SELECTION

In Chapter 2, I noted the radical character and intellectual power of Darwin's primary argument as embedded in the Malthusian insight about natural se­lection. In an irony that overturned the entire tradition of natural theology, Darwin held that all the higher order "harmonies" of good design and eco­logical balance arose as side consequences of a process — struggle among or­ganisms for personal reproductive success — that would demand an opposite interpretation if we sought moral messages in nature. Now, in the mid 1850's, Darwin attempted the same philosophical coup to accomplish for diversity exactly what he had done for adaptation in the initial formulation of natural selection — that is, to render a higher level "good," the maximization of life through division of labor, as a side consequence of organismic struggle. In January 1855 (in the note that Schweber views as the genesis of the principle of divergence), Darwin takes this fateful repeat step into the philosophical radicalism of rendering higher harmonies by individual struggle (quoted in Schweber, 1988): "On Theory of Descent, a divergence is implied and I think diversity of structure supporting more life is thus implied ... I have been led to this by looking at heath thickly clothed by heather and a fertile meadow both crowded, yet one cannot doubt more life supported in second than in the first; and hence (in part) more animals are supported. This is the final cause but mere result from struggle (I must think out last proposition)."*

So Darwin recognized in early 1855 that maximization would have to be explained by natural selection (a "mere result from struggle"); he also stated that development of such an argument would be complex and difficult ("I must think out last proposition"). The "principle of divergence of character," or more succinctly the "principle of divergence," emerged as the result of this intellectual labor. How, then, did Darwin finally render maximization of life as a consequence of struggle, or ordinary natural selection?

Darwin's solution, embedded as Kohn notes (1985) in his increasing will­ingness to accept sympatric speciation, holds that natural selection will gener­ally favor the most extreme, the most different, the most divergent forms in a spectrum of variation emanating from any common parental stock. Thus, each vigorous and successful stock produces a cone of varying forms about its own modal design (see Fig. 3-5 on p. 242). If natural selection generally fa­vors extreme variants in such arrays — the core claim of the "principle of di­vergence of character" — then vigorous ancestors will generate two or more descendant taxa fanning out towards maximally different form and adapta­tion. Two sequelae now complete the argument by drawing both ecological plenitude and taxonomic structure from the principle of divergence: First, the process of divergence must continue (see Fig. 3-5), impelling each vigorous descendant to produce still more advantageous extremes — thereby entraining phyletic trends of constantly increasing specialization. (The full extension ele­vates subspecies to species, species to genera, etc. — as extreme variants prolif­erate and diversify. The taxonomic tree of life emerges as an ultimate result.) Second, descendants will, in general, be competitively superior to parents, and must therefore tend to exterminate them in competition — for the number of species cannot increase indefinitely, and some ecological mechanism for re­placement of ancestors must exist.

In the Origin, Darwin begins, in his characteristic fashion, by analogy to artificial selection. Breeders, he argues, tend to favor extreme variants when trying to improve a stock; nature must follow suit (1859, p. 112). For the breeder's conscious aim, Darwin substitutes the natural advantages of ex­treme variants: "The more diversified the descendants from any one species become in structure, constitution, and habits, by so much will they be better enabled to seize on many and widely diversified places in the polity of nature, and so be enabled to increase in numbers" (1859, p. 112). With a botanical example, Darwin then strongly argues that divergence occurs because natural selection tends to favor extreme variants:

We well know that each species and each variety of grass is annually sowing almost countless seeds; and thus, as it may be said, is striving its utmost to increase its numbers. Consequently, I cannot doubt that in the course of many thousands of generations, the most distinct varieties of any one species of grass would always have the best chance of succeeding and of increasing in numbers, and thus of supplanting the less distinct varieties; and varieties, when rendered very distinct from each other, take the rank of species (1859, pp. 113-114).

Parental forms will then tend to succumb because natural selection favors their extreme and divergent descendants in competition: "As in each fully stocked country natural selection necessarily acts by the selected form having some advantage in the struggle for life over other forms, there will be a con­stant tendency in the improved descendants of any one species to supplant and exterminate in each stage of descent their predecessors and their original parent" (1859, p. 121).

All evolutionists know that the Origin of Species contains only a single fig­ure. This statement has been endlessly repeated in textbooks and lectures, but the true significance of this figure remains obscure, because we nearly always misinterpret the diagram (Fig. 3-5). We read this sole figure as Darwin's basic illustration of evolution as a branching process. But Darwin did not construct his diagram for such a general purpose. Rather, he devised this unique figure to provide a surgically precise description of the principle of divergence, ac­companied by several pages of explanatory text (pp. 116-126). Note how only two species of the original array (A—L) ultimately leave descendants — the left extreme A and the near right extreme I. Note how each diversifying species first generates an upward fan of variants about its modal form, and how only the peripheral populations of the fan survive to diversify further. Note that the total morphospace (horizontal axis) expands by divergence, even though only two of the original species leave descendants. Darwin writes (1859, p. 121): "In each genus, the species, which are already ex­tremely different in character, will generally tend to produce the greatest number of modified descendants; for these will have the best chance of filling new and widely different places in the polity of nature: hence in the diagram I have chosen the extreme species (A) and the nearly extreme species (I), as those which have largely varied, and have given rise to new varieties and spe­cies." Darwin also states that the success of extremes records the action of natural selection in its usual mode of organismic struggle: "And here the im­portance of the principle of benefit being derived from divergence of charac­ter comes in; for this will generally lead to the most different or divergent variations (represented by the outer dotted lines) being preserved and accu­mulated by natural selection" (1859, p. 117).

THE FAILURE OF DARWIN'S ARGUMENT AND THE NEED FOR

SPECIES SELECTION

I apologize to readers for this laborious (though, I trust, not uninterest­ing) exposition of Darwin on divergence, but I have now reached the crux both of this argument and, in one sense, of this entire book as well. I am ad­vocating both the necessity and importance of a hierarchical expansion of the theory of natural selection, defending this position by combining the stan­dard techniques of validation in science and scholarship: empirical example, the logic of argument, and historical illustration. Why, then, should so much space be accorded to Darwin's views on divergence of character — especially since I have just documented Darwin's attempt to render this second keystone of his theory as a consequence of ordinary natural selection at the organismic level?

I have proceeded in this way for a simple reason: Darwin's argument doesn't work, and he came to recognize this failure in the face of his brave at­tempt. Darwin struggled mightily to render this second keystone of his full theory by natural selection alone, but he could not carry the logic to comple­tion. He failed because his full argument demands a major contribution from species level selection (or, at the very least, strong attention to explicit sorting at the species level). I don't know that Darwin ever grasped this need in a fully explicit way, committed as he was to the exclusivity of selection on organ­isms. But he recognized the crucial difficulty at several places in his exposi­tion; and, with his usual honesty, he made his distress palpable again and again.

I perceive his discomfort in the labored description of divergence given in the Origin — 15 pages for a few points repeated many times, first in one way, then in another, all in a book so compressed that Darwin wanted to include the word "abstract" in the title. (John Murray, his publisher, demurred on ob­vious practical grounds). I sense Darwin's malaise in the fact that for this con­cept alone (among all the complex ideas developed in the Origin) he supplied both a figure and a meticulous "caption" (as it were), running for nearly ten pages. I note his dissatisfaction in the frequent shifting of attribution within his text — from consequences of organismic struggle (his usual and distinctive argument) on the one hand, to advantages for higher level units (usually spe­cies) on the other. In my reading, these shifts cannot be interpreted as com­fortable transitions rooted in a confident reduction of higher level phenomen­ology to lower level causality (as he had achieved in explaining adaptation by natural selection), but must instead be regarded as genuine gropings and confusions. Finally, Darwin recorded his distress in explicit exclamations of doubt — from his "I must think out [this] last proposition" of the 1855 note, to his description of divergence as "this rather perplexing subject" in the Ori­gin (1859, p. 116).

If the founder of the non-hierarchical organismal view, this doggedly persistent, fiercely honest and brilliant thinker, tried so hard to make the canoni­cal argument of natural selection work for the central higher-level phenome­non of species diversity — and could not bring the logic of his argument to a satisfactory completion — then perhaps his failure tells us something about the necessity of hierarchical selection. Darwin, by his own formulation, faced two great issues — adaptation and diversity. He tried to render both by natural selection based on struggle among organisms — adaptation by the Malthusian insight of 1838, diversity by the principle of divergence formulated in the mid 1850's. His explanation worked well, or at least sprung no logical holes, for adaptation. But he could not carry the same argument through, despite exten­sive and valiant attempts, for diversity — the primary domain of species selec­tion, as all modern advocates hold (see, for example, Gould and Eldredge, 1988, replying to Maynard Smith's 1988 misconception).

Schweber (1980, 1985, 1988) noted Darwin's trouble with discordance between levels, though he does not provide the technical arguments detailed be­low. In Schweber's view, Darwin was driven to formulate an argument that "does not cohere" (Schweber, personal communication) because his century's ignorance of hereditary mechanisms drove him to describe variation within species and varieties treated as units, while the causal structure of natural se­lection rested upon individual organisms. Arguments about organisms and species are not comfortably intertwined or mutually supporting within Dar­win's conceptual structure: rather, the two levels remain discordant and inad­equately (if not illogically) bridged. "This difference in the 'units' used is im­portant. It accounts for the fact that at times levels of description were interchanged and some confusion necessarily crept in" (Schweber, 1980, p. 240). "There was no link between adaptation and speciation, except what­ever could be supplied by a quasi-historical developmental idea of optimizing the amount of life" (ibid., pp. 287-288). "The problem of the different levels of descriptions was confined to how the properties of variations in individuals ... were responsible for the assumed variability characteristic of varieties and species. This problem Darwin never solved" (ibid., p. 288).

We can exemplify Schweber's perceptions about Darwin's incoherence of argument by dissecting the logic of Darwin's attempt to use ordinary natural selection as the basis of divergence. For three basic reasons, his attempt to in­voke selection among organisms as an explanation for patterns in speciation and extinction — the heart of the "principle of divergence," and the primum desideratum for a complete theory of natural selection — fails because the level of species must be addressed both directly and causally, while Darwin's rationale for explanation from below includes gaps and fatal weaknesses.

The calculus of individual success

Darwin treats the principle of divergence in two extensive discussions — the long and even labored account of chapter 4 in the Origin of Species (1859, pp. 111-126), and the even more detailed exposition intended for the "big species book" that Wallace interrupted and Darwin never published because he rushed to compose the Origin instead. The manuscript for most of this larger project survives, including the full discussion of divergence intended for chapter 6 "On Natural Selection." This text, published under R. C. Stauffer's editorship in 1975, treats the principle of divergence on pages 227-251.

When, in the 1970's, I first read the Origin with the notion of hierarchical selection in mind, I was fascinated by Darwin's struggle to bridge the levels, and his ultimate lack of success. Schweber speaks of "incoherence"; I would rather describe Darwin's "moves" of argument as an oscillation between one mode and the other. In some passages (including those cited above), Darwin speaks of ordinary natural selection and the advantages enjoyed by extreme variants. In others, he judges the success of a parental form not by the vigor or competitive prowess of offspring, but by the number of descendant species emanating from a rootstock.

These themes could, of course, be complementary. One perspective might imply and grade into the other; the two levels could represent alternate solu­tions of the Necker cube (see Dawkins, 1982) — that is, views of the same con­figuration from different vantage points. The individual success of extreme organisms may simply imply, ipso facto and necessarily, the ultimate multipli­cation of species, and success measured by number of descendant taxa might therefore act as a surrogate for, or simple extension of, natural selection. (For this reason, I assume, Darwin includes the principle of divergence as the larg­est section of chapter 4, entitled natural selection.)

But this argument does not cohere, and I think that any careful reader must be struck by Darwin's discomfort as he mixes and juggles the argument for success of extreme organismal variants with the calculus of advantage mapped by number of descendant taxa. Darwin's argument falters because the use of a lower level (success of extreme variants, in this case) to explain a phenomenon at a higher level (multiplication of species) can only work if "perfect transfer" can be defended — that is, if the lower level entails the higher as a direct consequence without any intervention (even a synergistic boost, not to mention a contrary force) from causes at the higher level itself. Darwin understood this principle perfectly well. Indeed, he was probably the only man who, in this infancy of evolutionary science, had carefully and con­sistently thought the logic of selection through to this correct interpretation. Thus, Darwin tried to construct an argument for perfect transfer — but he failed. Darwin advanced these claims in Natural Selection, but ultimately dropped them from the Origin, because (I suspect) he recognized their weak­nesses. (I criticize the arguments for perfect transfer in points two and three below; in this subsection, I document Darwin's bold claim for a higher level calculus of individual success.)

Consider Darwin's first hypothetical example of the principle of divergence in the Origin (1859, p. 113). He speaks of a "carnivorous quadruped" that, by ordinary natural selection, has expanded in population to the limits of lo­cal environments. To do even better in the struggle for life, this form must now diversify into several descendant taxa. But how can the canonical argu­ment for natural selection be cashed out in terms of multiplicity of descen­dant species? The logic of individual struggle carries no implications about the splitting of populations (especially for an in situ sympatric splitting that implies general predictability rather than the simple good fortune of geo­graphic isolation).

Take the case of a carnivorous quadruped, of which the number that can be supported in any country has long ago arrived at its full average. If its natural powers of increase be allowed to act, it can succeed in increasing (the country not undergoing any change in its conditions) only by its varying descendants seizing on places at present occupied by other ani­mals: some of them, for instance, being enabled to feed on new kinds of prey, either dead or alive; some inhabiting new stations, climbing trees, frequenting water, and some perhaps becoming less carnivorous. The more diversified in habits and structure the descendants of our carnivo­rous animals became, the more places they would be enabled to occupy (Darwin, 1859, p. 113).

Darwin continually invokes the calculus of individual success by number of descendant taxa (see also 1859, p. 116, and Stauffer, ed., 1975, p. 228): "As a general rule, the more diversified in structure the descendants from any one species can be rendered, the more places they will be enabled to seize on, and the more their modified progeny will be increased" (Darwin, 1859, p. 119).

Often, he mixes both criteria — the adaptive success of extreme variants in struggle, and the calculus of descendant taxa — in a single statement.

Here in one way comes in the importance of our so-called principle of divergence: as in the long run, more descendants from a common parent will survive, the more widely they become diversified in habits, constitution and structure so as to fill as many places as possible in the polity of nature [organismic level], the extreme varieties and the extreme species will have a better chance of surviving or escaping extinction, than the in­termediate and less modified varieties or species [taxon level]. But if in a large genus we destroy all the intermediate species, the remaining forms will constitute sub-genera or distinct genera, according to the almost ar­bitrary value put on these terms (in Stauffer, ed., 1975, p. 238).

But are these two statements really equivalent? Does the lower level claim for organismic advantage imply the higher level phenomenon of species prolifer­ation without reference to any higher level causes?

In his most striking passage, indicating that he did grasp the need for higher level sorting based upon such group properties as the range of varia­tion, Darwin attributes the success of introduced placentals in Australia not, as we might anticipate from ordinary natural selection, to the adaptive biomechanical superiority of placental design (honed in the refiner's fire of more severe competition in Eurasia and America), but to a greater range of placen­tal variation across taxa, produced by their later stage in the historical pro­cess of divergence.

A set of animals, with their organization but little diversified, could hardly compete with a set more perfectly diversified in structure. It may be doubted, for instance, whether the Australian marsupials, which are divided into groups differing but little from each other, and feebly repre­senting, as Mr. Waterhouse and others have remarked, our carnivorous, ruminant, and rodent mammals, could successfully compete with these well-pronounced orders. In the Australian mammals, we see the process of diversification in an early and incomplete stage of development (Dar­win, 1859, p. 116).

The causes of trends

Trends represent the primary phenomenon of evolution at higher levels and longer time scales. Trends therefore pose the key challenge, the ultimate making or breaking point, for extrapolationist theories that seek the causes of macroevolution in microevolutionary processes centered upon organismic selection. Darwin understood and accepted this challenge; his principle of divergence marks his attempt to depict trends as extrapolated results of natural selection. (The principle of divergence attempts to explain morphological trends by specialization and progressive departure from ancestral form, and also to account for numerical trends by multiplication of some taxa at the ex­pense of others within a clade.)

Advocates of species selection hold that trends must be described as the differential birth and death of species (not the simple anagenetic extrapolation of change within a population), and that the causes for such differentials must be sought, at least in part, in irreducible species-level fitness (see Chap­ter 8). The standard extrapolationist rejoinder invokes two arguments: (1) Differential death and survival rather than differential birth (of species) usu­ally fuels trends. The death and persistence of groups can be reduced more easily to organismic competition, while differential production of species more often demands irreducible causes, for an organism cannot speciate by itself, while the death of a population may represent no more than the accu­mulated demise of all organisms. (2) The cause of differential survival or death must be reducible to ordinary natural selection.

Darwin did not offer his principle of divergence as a rejoinder to any explicitly developed theory of species selection, for no such formulation existed when he wrote. But he understood the logical requirements of his theory so well that he provided the necessary rationale without the spur of a formally stated alternative. He also, and uniquely, reinforced his argument with an il­lustration of the need for differential survival of certain kinds of variants within random arrays. In Natural Selection, Darwin presents his case as a second figure (reproduced here as Fig. 3-6) that he did not include in the abridged Origin of Species in 1859. (Virtually no one knew about the exis­tence of this figure or argument until Stauffer published the manuscript of Natural Selection in 1975.)

The basic figure of both Natural Selection and the Origin illustrates Dar­win's claim that only a few vigorous species will produce the variants leading to the "recruitment" of new species. (These vigorous species are the extreme forms favored by ordinary natural selection — A and M in Natural Selection, A and I in the Origin, see Figs. 3-5 and 3-6.) The variants of these vigorous species radiate in an even fan, or random array, about the modal form of their ancestor. A trend then arises because ordinary natural selection favors ex­tremes within the fan. Darwin recognizes that a trend to specialization and diversity cannot be generated only by the greater vigor of extreme species in the initial array; he must also defend a second proposition about differential survival among offspring of these favored extremes.

The second figure of Natural Selection now comes into play (Fig. 3-6). Darwin shows us what happens under a regime of random survival within the fan of variants generated by the favored vigorous species at ecological extremes, as opposed to a regime of selection positively directed towards extreme members

3-5. The famous and only diagram published by Darwin in the Origin of Species, 1859. Darwin did not construct this much misunderstood diagram as a simple and general model of branching phylogeny, but quite specificaiiy as an illustration of his Principle of Divergence. Note that each species tends to produce a fan of variants and that the most successful forms tend to emerge from extreme positions of each fan. See text for details.

3-6. The expanded version of Darwin's figure, drawn in preparation for the long version, Natural Selection, that was never published because Darwin hurried to complete the shorter Origin of Species after receiving Wallace's manuscript. This version was not published until 1975 (see Stauffer, 1975). Here, Darwin shows us how the expectation of enhanced success for extreme variants within each fan, as predicted by his Principle of Divergence, will lead to trends (upper part of diagram); whereas random survival of variants (lower part of diagram) yields no trend and no ecological expansion. See text for details.

of each fan. The trend to diversification halts in the random regime. The final products need not become any more distinct than the initial parents (f10, h10, and l10 lie right under ancestor A, while m10 does not differ from parental M). On the other hand, differential survival of extremes within the fans will produce trends (also seen in Fig. 3-6). Darwin writes of the second diagram (the lower half of Fig. 3-6), where variation to the left and right of A repre­sents greater or lesser adaptation to drought in plants: "Everything is the same as in diagram I... except that it is left to mere chance in each stage of descent, whether the more or less moisture loving varieties are preserved; and the result is, as graphically shown, that a10 and l10 [sic, he has no a10 in the drawing, but represents the leftward extreme as f10] differ in this respect; and so in other respects, hardly more than did the first varieties (a1l1) which were produced" (in Stauffer, ed., 1975, p. 244).

The argument for a trend that can be reduced to natural selection therefore hinges upon reasons for differential survival of extremes within the fans of varying species; for the trend cannot emerge simply from the greater evolu­tionary vigor of the ancestral extremes themselves. (Interestingly, Darwin never considers the alternative, more congenial to species selection, of greater production of variants at the extremes, with random survival within fans.) Darwin now makes his crucial move for ordinary natural selection, using his principle of divergence: extremes enjoy differential survival within the fans of variants, because natural selection favors adaptation to peripheral, over ad­aptation to central, "stations" in any region. (We must remember that all members of the fan are well adapted to their own local bits of the environ­ment). Now, at the crux of his development, Darwin tries to defend his posi­tion on the differential value of extreme stations, and his argument falls apart — to be rescued only with a forced and self-contradictory ad hoc hypothesis (explicitly stated in Natural Selection, but wisely omitted from the Origin).

Darwin provides two potential reasons for differential success of organ­isms adapted to extreme environmental stations. The first remains perfectly acceptable, and would pass muster today as a standard ecological argument featured in all textbooks — reduced competition in less "crowded" extreme environments: "From our principle of divergence, the extreme varieties of any of the species, and more especially of those species which are now ex­treme in some characters, will have the best chance, after a vast lapse of time, of surviving; for they will tend to occupy new places in the economy of our imaginary country" (in Stauffer, ed., 1975, p. 239).

If Darwin had stopped here, his argument would have remained consistent, if dangerously weak. But his relentless probing would not permit such a course — for he knew that a key problem remained unsolved:* extreme vari­ants may be favored in their own extreme environments, but why should they prevail over other variants in more central environments? After all, the more central ancestor continues to survive after the extreme variant buds off. The ancestor should therefore be favored in its own central environment, and the descendant in its new peripheral station. Why, then, should the descendant ever replace the ancestor — so long as central environments persist along with marginal places? In all his writing on divergence, Darwin recognized that trends to specialization could not occur unless extreme descendants tended to wipe out more central ancestors in competition: trends, in other words, re­quired a pattern of differential extinction as well, for the number of species in a region cannot increase indefinitely.

And here, after so much effort and careful development, Darwin bogged down. For this most resolutely higher level phenomenon of the supposed differential success of extreme vs. central species, Darwin could not provide a tenable argument based upon natural selection. With evident discomfort, Darwin resorted to an ad hoc assumption: he argued that while extreme vari­ants adapt to their marginal stations, they also retain all the adaptations of their parents for the original central habitats. Thus, the descendant extremes remain as good as their parents in the ancestral environment, while adding a capacity for survival in marginal habitats.

But how can such a proposition be defended? Why should a species that has left one environment, and explicitly adapted to another, still retain all its prowess in an environment no longer inhabited (and from which it has ac­tively diverged)? Not only does this proposition make no sense prima facie; such a claim also contradicts the canonical argument (often embraced by Darwin and his contemporaries) that specialization leads to "locking in" and decreased flexibility. In short, Darwin knows that he has run into a severe log­ical problem in trying to justify a central implication of his general argument: the differential survival of extreme taxa with a consequently preferential ex­tinction of central species. How can such a pattern be explained — for central and marginal species should not, after all, be in overt competition, and cen­tral environments cannot be regarded as generally more evanescent than ex­tremes? Darwin therefore invokes his ad hoc argument (described just above) for an expanded range of adaptation in extreme species, in order to place the organisms from these extremes into competition with their parents, thus gen­erating a hypothetical explanation for differential parental death in terms of natural selection.

Darwin begins by stating his ad hoc assumption: "As m1 tends to inherit all the advantages of its parent M [see right side of Fig. 3-6], with the additional advantage of enduring somewhat more drought, it will have an advantage over it, and will probably first be a thriving local variety, which will spread and become extremely common and ultimately, supplant its own parent" (in Stauffer, ed., 1975, p. 239).

But Darwin immediately senses a problem and recognizes that descendants might not retain the parental range, and that ancestors might survive the on­slaught of their phyletic children by living in a different station, thereby avoiding competition. "If m1-10 had been produced, capable of enduring more drought, but not at the same time enduring an equal amount of moisture with the parent M, both parent and modified offspring might co-exist: the parent (with perhaps a more restricted range) in the dryer stations, and m1-10 in the very driest stations" (ibid., p. 240).

Darwin then rejects this reasonable but debilitating scenario with his ad hoc assumption, though he senses the weakness of his proposal and salvages his argument almost apologetically, especially at the end:

In the imaginary case of the varieties m1-10 which are supposed to inherit all the characters of M, with the addition of enduring more drought; these varieties would inhabit stations, where M could not exist, but in the less dry stations m1-10 would have very little power of supplanting their parent M; nevertheless during unusually dry seasons m1-10 would have a great advantage over M and would spread; but in damper sea­sons M would not have a corresponding advantage over m1-10 for these latter varieties are supposed to inherit all the characters of their parent. So there would be a tendency in m1-10 to supplant M, but at an exces­sively slow rate. It would be easy to show that the same thing might oc­cur in the case of many other new characters thus acquired; but the sub­ject is far too doubtful and speculative to be worth pursuing (ibid., pp. 241-242).

Species selection based on propensity for extinction

Relentlessly probing as usual, Darwin now identifies another weak point in his argument. If divergence follows this predictable and necessary pattern, given the propensity of natural selection to favor extreme variants in all direc­tions, then what prevents this inexorable process from reaching absurdity in a final state of such precise and extended diversification that each species con­tains but a single individual? (This issue became important for Darwin when he moved from his earlier allopatric view of speciation to embrace a largely sympatric model with an intrinsic and predictable "motor" for the generation of species by selection of extreme variants): "But if the time has not yet ar­rived, may it not at some epoch come, when there will be almost as many spe­cific forms as individuals? I think we can clearly see that this would never be the case" (in Stauffer, ed., 1975, p. 247).

Darwin proposes three reasons for nature's avoidance of such an absurd outcome, the first conventional, but the second and third invoking species se­lection on population properties of size and variability. For the first reason, Darwin cites ecological notions that have since become standard — limiting similarity and a restricted number of "addresses" in the economy of nature. Diversity does beget more diversity, and the physical environment sets no strict a priori upper bound. But limits imposed by "inorganic conditions" will eventually cause selection to rein in the intrinsic process of ever finer diversi­fication:

Firstly, there would be no apparent benefit in a greater amount of modification than would adapt organic beings to different places in the polity of nature; for although the structure of each organism stands in the most direct and important relation to many other organic beings, and as these latter increase in number and diversity of organization, the conditions of the one will tend to become more and more complex, and its descen­dants might well profit by a further division of labor; yet all organ­isms are fundamentally related to the inorganic conditions of the world, which do not tend to become infinitely more varied (ibid., p. 247).

But Darwin also recognizes that ecological limits may not be sufficient to restrain diversification, and he advances two other mechanisms, based on species selection against traits of small populations. First, Darwin argues that long before diversity reaches a physical limit (as quoted just above), species selection against finely divided taxa with consequently small populations will balance ordinary natural selection for further diversification: "If there exist in any country, a vast number of species (although a greater amount of life could be supported) the average number of individuals of each species must be somewhat less than if there were not so many species; and any species, repre­sented by but few individuals, during the fluctuation in number to which all species must be subject from fluctuations in seasons, number of enemies, etc., would be extremely liable to total extinction" (ibid., pp. 247-248).

Finally, Darwin cites another reason for species selection against popu­lations of unusually small size. Such populations are not only more prone to extinction; they are also less subject to further speciation because such a re­stricted number of individuals per population implies an insufficiency of op­portunity for the origin of rare favorable variants: "Lastly we have seen . . . that the amount of variations, and consequently of variation in a right or ben­eficial direction for natural selection to seize on and preserve, will bear some relation within any given period, to the number of individuals living and lia­ble to variation during such period: consequently when the descendants from any one species have become modified into very many species, without all be­coming numerous in individuals, . . . there will be a check amongst the less common species to their further modification" (ibid., p. 248).

In a lovely closing metaphor, Darwin provides a fine description of the cen­tral hierarchical concept of balance produced by negative feedback between levels. Number of species will equilibrate at a stable level of diversification when positive selection at the organismal level (Darwin's argument for the advantages of extreme variants) becomes balanced by negative selection at the species level (disadvantages of small population size): "the lesser number of the individuals," Darwin writes, "serving as a regulator or fly-wheel to the increasing rate of further modification, or the production of new specific forms" (ibid., p. 248).

In summary, I have documented both Darwin's discomfort with his forced attempt to explain the primary species-level phenomenon of diversity by nat­ural selection of extreme organismal variants, and his inability to complete the argument without an explicit invocation of species selection against taxa with small populations. His attempt to render his "principle of divergence" by organismal selection alone founders on three bases, the first two negative in logical barriers forced by the premise of organismal exclusivity, and the third positive in a potential "rescue" sought by acknowledging a necessary role for species selection: (1) He promotes a calculus of ultimate organismal success in terms of number of descendant taxa, but cannot extend his argu­ment for diversification by selection of extreme variants to achieve the re­quired perfect transfer to the species level. (2) In order to explain trends, he backs himself into a contradictory and ad hoc explanation for the elimination of ancestral forms by natural selection in competition with descendants. (3) Faced with the logical dilemma of runaway diversification under natural se­lection alone, he advocates negative species selection based upon small popu­lation sizes to bring the process of divergence into equilibrium.

POSTSCRIPT: SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM OF THE

"DELICATE ARRANGEMENT"

The power of a new framework often becomes most apparent in its capa­city to solve small and persistent puzzles. I therefore end this section with a solution to an old conundrum, and with another refutation for Brakeman's (1980) claim that Darwin pinched the principle of divergence from Wallace, and then lied to cover up the theft. What did Wallace say about divergence? Did he really develop the principle in useful ways that Darwin had not an­ticipated, and might have coveted as his own? When we turn to Wallace's celebrated Ternate paper (sent to Darwin in 1858), we find only a cursory statement about divergence. Wallace only discusses anagenetic trends of de­scendants away from ancestors. He does not even consider the production of multiple taxa from single sources: "But this new, improved, and populous race by itself, in course of time, gives rise to new varieties, exhibiting several diverging modifications of form, any of which, tending to increase the facili­ties for preserving existence, must, by the same general law, in their turn become predominant. Here, then, we have progression and continued diver­gence deduced from the general laws which regulate the existence of animals in a state of Nature, and from the undisputed fact that varieties do frequently occur" (Wallace, 1858, in Barrett et al., 1987).

We must conclude that Wallace regarded a principle of divergence as "no big deal." He grasped the idea in outline and apparently found no problem therein. His short statement could not possibly have taught Darwin anything useful, for Darwin had already carried the argument far beyond this basic comment. Why then did Wallace fail to share Darwin's puzzlement, excitement and sense of complexity about the principle of divergence? I can imagine two explanations. Either Wallace simply didn't think the issue through to all the difficulties and implications that Darwin recognized. (After all, malarial fits on Ternate are less conducive to deep thought than years of protracted strolling around the sandwalk at Down.) Or he did think the issue through and, finding nothing problematical, therefore devoted little attention to the subject. If the second alternative is correct, then my framework for considering the principle of divergence as a problem in levels of selection can resolve Wallace's puzzling lack of appreciation.

As Kottler (1985) has shown, Wallace and Darwin were not identical peas from the pod of natural selection. They battled long and hard on several cru­cial issues, mostly involving Wallace's panselectionism vs. Darwin's more sub­tle view of adaptation (Gould, 1980d). One key area of disagreement cen­tered upon the target of natural selection. Darwin labored to work out a consistent theory that virtually restricted selection to struggles among organ­isms (see Chapter 2 for his interesting reasons). Wallace, as Kottler shows, never grasped the centrality, or even the importance, of the issue of levels and agency for a theory of natural selection. He moved from level to level as the situation seemed to imply, choosing whatever target of selection would best support his panselectionist leanings. (For example, he ascribed hybrid steril­ity to species selection in order to preserve his conviction that features of such importance must originate as active adaptations; whereas Darwin, committed to a consistent theory of organismal selection, regarded hybrid sterility as an incidental side consequence of accumulated differences arising by ordinary selection in two initially isolated lineages — see p. 131.) Thus, if Wallace ever pondered the principle of divergence to the point of recognizing an issue in levels of selection, he would not have responded, as Darwin did, with such a sustained, almost impassioned, quest for resolution. Wallace would not have identified any problem at all, for he never grasped the thorny issue of a need to specify levels in the first place. A simple statement about divergence would have sufficed — as Wallace indeed provided. Darwin, in his over reliance upon organismal selection, may never have reached the finish line in explicating the principle of divergence; but Wallace scarcely got off the blocks.

Coda

No one would argue that persistence in history makes anything right or even worthy — lest cruelty, murder and mayhem win our imprimatur by a misplaced criterion of longevity. Still, in the world of ideas, long pedigrees through disparate systems, and recurrence in the face of attempted avoid­ance; usually signify something about the power of an idea, or its necessary place in the logic of a larger enterprise.

Causal — and not merely descriptive — accounts of hierarchy have infused evolutionary biology in this way from the beginning of our subject. Lamarck initiated this conceptual rubric with a version in the invalid mode of causal differences based on opposition between levels. Darwin knew what he didn't like about this style, and his theory — preserved unchanged to our own ortho­dox commitments today — sinks a strong foundation in an active rejection of hierarchy in this inherently combative mode. Weismann and Darwin him­self — the two greatest evolutionists and deepest thinkers with an explicit commitment to the single-level theory of natural selection — tried to extend the logic of this idea to encompass every important issue in evolution. Both became stymied, and eventually surrendered, with pleasure in Weismann's case at least, to the need for hierarchy in devising any complete system for the logic of evolutionary explanation in selectionist terms — Weismann on subcellular selection for explaining trends, Darwin on species selection for encompassing diversity. Both men accepted causal hierarchy in the modern and valid sense of similar forces working in distinct ways at different levels.

Very few evolutionists know anything about this history, and may there­fore doubt the importance of the subject. But downgrading on this criterion would represent a great mistake rooted in the conservative premise that any­thing vital must be easily visible in all contexts. Anyone tempted to accept such a basis for dismissal should consider the conventional tales of rulers and conquerors — virtually the only subject matter of so many secondary school and undergraduate history courses — and recognize what modern scholars have taught us by probing the hitherto invisible pathways of daily life among ordinary people. Compare the overt and conventional history of diplomacy with the often more potent, but academically invisible, history of technology.

Evolutionary thought began with hierarchy, wrongly conceived. Our canonical theory of natural selection arose as an attempted rebuttal. The most brilliant practitioners of that theory could not bring the argument to comple­tion; so both Weismann and Darwin brought hierarchy back, in a valid style this time, to render the theory of selection both coherent and comprehensive. I previously offered a choice of proverbs: you may view hierarchy as a bad penny or a pearl of great price. But hierarchy, like the poor, has always been with us (and, perhaps, shall inherit the earth as well!). This situation can only recall James Boswell's famous statement about one of Dr. Johnson's col­leagues who lamented that he had tried to be a philosopher, but had failed be­cause cheerfulness always broke through. Too many of us have tried to be good Darwinian evolutionists, and have felt discouraged because hierarchy always breaks in. I suggest that we rejoice — with good cheer — and welcome an under appreciated and truly indispensable old friend.
