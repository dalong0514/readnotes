The Timeless Physics of Evolved Function





STRUCTURALISM'S ODD MAN OUTSIDE





In a famous passage from the Introduction to the Origin of Species, Darwin identified the intricately adaptive character of most anatomical features as the primary phenomenon that any theory of evolutionary mechanisms must ex­plain. Many other sources of information, he states, can easily prove evolu­tion's factuality, but we will not understand the causes of change until we can explain “how the innumerable species inhabiting this world have been modi­fied so as to acquire that perfection of structure and coadaptation which most justly excites our admiration” (1859, p. 3).

Darwin felt that this striking and pervasive functionality of organic design required an explicit functional theory of evolutionary causes rooted in the proposition that adaptive structures originate “for” their utility. As function­alist theories, both Lamarckian soft inheritance and Darwinian natural selec­tion share a defining premise that environmental information about adaptive design somehow passes to organisms, and that organisms then respond by fashioning traits to enhance their competitive ability within these environ­ments. (Above all, functionalist theories require explicit interaction of organ­ism and environment in the service of improving local adaptation. The pure imposition of one side upon the yielding properties of the other side does not qualify.)

The strikingly different mechanisms of the two major functionalist theo­ries — organic response to felt needs for Lamarck, natural selection upon isotropic variation for Darwin — should not obscure their agreement on the key functional principle that adaptation drives evolution as organisms change to secure better fit to their environments. We prefer Darwin and reject Lamarck because nature's mechanisms of heredity and variation validate the efficacy of natural selection and disprove the existence of soft inheritance, not because we can specify any basic difference in their shared commitment to a function­alist account of evolutionary mechanics.

Structuralist or formalist theories, on the other hand, generally seek to ex­plain the origin of adaptive design in terms of such internal forces as con­straint and directed variability. In the strictest versions of these theories, ex­ternal causes can only act as editors to distill the most workable phenotypes from the full range of potential shapes that structural rules engender. Func­tion may therefore determine what lives and what dies, but not what can (and does) originate.

Chapters 4 and 5 discussed the two major structuralist theories that we now reject for their operation as strict alternatives and denials of Darwin­ian functionalism: (1) orthogenesis, with its central claim that evolutionary trends follow internal drives in variation, and that selection can only acceler­ate or retard these inherent and inevitable pathways; and (2) saltation, with its premise that occasional fortuitous discontinuities in variation create new species all at once, and that selection can only intensify the process by pre­serving lucky sports and eliminating old, superseded designs.

Chapters 4 and 5, and much of Chapter 10 as well, also discuss more acceptable forms of structuralism that do not attempt to replace natural selec­tion, but rather work in concert with known Darwinian mechanisms to chan­nel possible directions of evolutionary change “from the inside” along path­ways of variation that record constraints of history or principles of physical construction. I shall return to this theme of internal constraints in the last two sections of this chapter, where I discuss the important structural principle of non-adaptive origin followed by cooptation for a descendant's utility.

This initial section of Chapter 11, however, represents an interlude be­tween historical constraints (Chapter 10) and structural constraints based on mechanically forced (or, at the opposite end of this spectrum, simply inher­ited) correlations with actively selected features (Sections II and III of this chapter). This interlude also discusses a form of structural constraint — but of a markedly different nature: direct molding by physical laws and forces act­ing upon the developing organism. This “maverick” theme has played only a small role in the history of evolutionary thought (a fact that should elicit no judgment about actual importance, for we all recognize that today's ignored or ridiculed theme can become the centerpiece of tomorrow's revolutionary theory).

If adaptive phenotypes originate directly and immediately from the imposi­tion of physical forces upon the “yielding putty” (if you will) of organic mate­rial, then we need no functionalist account of “that perfection of structure and coadaptation” — for good form emerges automatically from the nature of physical reality (by external forces imposed upon the organism, or internal forces exerted from within as the organism grows). We get, in Kauffman's memorable phrase (1993) “order for free,” and need not posit any explicit organismal mechanisms, as functionalist theories propose (Darwinian selection or Lamarckian inheritance), for “reading” the selective requirements of local environments and responding by evolutionary change.

Put another way, this structuralist theory of direct imposition asks nothing of organic matter beyond its malleability for passive shaping by physical forces. (One might argue that the malleability itself arose by a functionalist mechanism like natural selection, but the discussion of this section focuses upon current modes of change, not the origin of preconditions that make such changes possible.)

This theory of adaptive design by direct imposition differs from most for­malist accounts of evolutionary change in two major ways (while agreeing on the central premise — the basis for my taxonomy of theories in the first place — that structural rules, rather than functional responses, generate organismal phenotypes):

1. Most structuralist theories identify the sources of adaptive order as residing largely “inside” the organism in the form of constraining genetic and developmental homologies, or the allometric and consequential rules that Darwin called “correlations of growth.” (For this reason, I have used “formalist,” “structuralist,” and “internalist” as virtually synonymous terms throughout this book.) But the structuralist theory of direct imposition lo­cates the causes of adaptive order in physical laws of nature lying “outside” (and prior to) the specific architectural blueprints of each particular Bauplan (even though these physical laws may impose their shaping powers “from the inside” during growth).

2. In an even more iconoclastic claim (discussed previously on pp. 1053–1055 as the defining peculiarity of this way of thought), proponents of adap­tive design by direct imposition tend to ignore, and often to devalue quite ex­plicitly, the role of phylogeny, or any kind of historical analysis, in setting the Bauplane or developmental rules that channel and constrain patterns of evo­lution in any particular group. If physical forces shape organisms directly, then their prior histories don't matter, and we need only consider the immedi­ate impress of current circumstances upon malleable organic materials. After all, we don't invoke any aspect of history or genealogical connection to ex­plain why Cambrian quartz from Asia exhibits the same crystal structure as Recent quartz from America. So why should we not attribute the logarithmic spirals of Paleozoic and modern gastropods to the same spatiotemporal in-variance of physical laws?

One might say, in epitome, that the first argument opposes this theory to all other, and more conventional, forms of structuralist thought; whereas the second statement, far more radical in scope, opposes this theory to the central concept of evolutionary biology itself (in both structuralist and functionalist accounts): the role of history, and the importance of phylogeny in under­standing both present forms and future prospects.

I doubt that this theory of adaptive design by direct physical imposition could ever stand as a complete, or even a dominant, explanation of evolution. (We shall see that even the most celebrated exponent of this view, D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson in On Growth and Form, ultimately ceded the major turf of explanation, at least for complex organisms, to phylogeny and heredity rather than to immediate physical imposition.) But I suspect that direct physical assembly or imposition may supply an important, perhaps even a controlling, theme in two major and rather different arenas of evolutionary theory: (1) The origin of life and the initial assembly of basic and universal components of cellular organization and genetic structure. Do we not sense that much of life's initial history falls into the domain of “universal chemis­try” and the general physics of self-organizing systems, whereas the actual, divergent pathways of metazoan phyla then fall under the control of histor­ical contingency? (2) Broad predictabilities of life's pattern through time, transcending the contingent particularities of any individual lineage. The structure of ecological pyramids must display some physical predictability, whereas the occupation of the top carnivore apex by lions or tigers or bears (or phorusrhachids or borhyaenids) demands knowledge of historical partic­ulars. The increasingly right skewed distribution of life's complexity, with stability of the bacterial mode throughout (Gould, 1996a), speaks more to the general physics of reflecting boundaries (of minimal complexity in this case), the physically necessary origin of life at this minimal complexity, and the stochasticity of random walks, than to any historical detail of uniquely earthly existence.

I am a historian at heart, and although the theme of immediate physical assembly intrigues me — and no one with literary pretensions could remain un­moved by the coincidence that D'Arcy Thompson's Growth and Form, the most stylish book in the history of anglophonic biology, also happens to be the “Bible” of this particular view of life — I don't think that the hypothesis of direct physical construction will play a large part in the expansion of Darwin­ian theory advocated as my central argument in this book. I therefore view this section as a “place holder” in the logic of my case, and not at all as a complete or even adequate account of an important subject. I will occupy this particular place in an idiosyncratic manner by analyzing D'Arcy Thompson's great work (1917, 1942) and then discussing, much more briefly, the most important modern expressions of this view of life in the works of Goodwin (1994) and Kauffman (1993). But method does lie in the sanity of this choice, for one could not ask for a better vehicle than D'Arcy Thompson's brilliant argument and stunning prose. His magisterial (if idiosyncratic and, at times, even cranky) book embodies an entire worldview within its ample scope. His specific examples may be wrong or dated, but no one has ever presented a more complete and coherent version of this approach to the explanation of evolution, including explicit discussion of all major implications for general theory. In this sense, an exegesis of D'Arcy Thompson may well represent the most modern and relevant way to discuss this important corner of evolution­ary thought.





D'ARCY THOMPSON'S SCIENCE OF FORM





The structure of an argument


In 1945, the Public Orator of Oxford lauded D'Arcy Thompson as unicum disciplinae liberations exemplar (the outstanding example of a man of liberal education — at the ceremony for his receipt of an honorary degree as Doctor in Civil Law). In 1969, the Whole Earth Catalog, the commercial bible of the “green” movement in America, called his major work “a paradigm classic.” Few people can list such diverse distinctions in their compendium of honors. But then, few people have displayed so wide a range of talent. D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson (1860-1948), Professor of Natural History at the Scot­tish universities of Dundee and St. Andrews, translated Aristotle's Historia animalium, wrote glossaries of Greek birds and fishes, compiled statistics for the Fishery Board of Scotland and contributed the article on pycnogonids to the Cambridge Natural History.

But D'Arcy Thompson's current reputation rests almost entirely upon a book of a thousand pages, revered by artists and architects as well as by engi­neers and biologists — the “paradigm classic,” On Growth and Form (1917, 2nd edition, 1942). P. B. Medawar (1967, p. 232) lauded this volume as “be­yond comparison the finest work of literature in all the annals of science that have been recorded in the English tongue.” G. Evelyn Hutchinson (1948, p. 579) regarded Growth and Form as “one of the very few books on a scien­tific matter written in this century which will, one may be confident, last as long as our too fragile culture.”

Although I have studied D'Arcy Thompson's wonderful book throughout my career (see Gould, 1971b, for my first, and in retrospect embarrassingly puerile, publication in a journal of the humanities), I originally made a major error in siting him within the history of biology. All intellectuals love a coura­geous loner, and I had been beguiled by D'Arcy Thompson's seemingly anach­ronistic peculiarities — his flowery, sometimes overblown, but often soaring and powerful, Victorian prose; his expertise at fully professional levels in Latin and Greek; even his lifelong residence in an outlying region that, in my false mental geography, might well have been located above the Arctic Circle. In retrospect, I had unthinkingly conflated my sense of his intellectual dis­tance from conventional thought with an assumption about physical isola­tion as well. When I finally visited the University of St. Andrews (for the hum­bling experience of receiving an honorary degree in D'Arcy Thompson's own bailiwick), I recognized its proximity to Edinburgh, and its easy access by rail. (As a further confirmation of St. Andrews's central location within the contemporary world, I began to write this section on the very day that Tiger Woods won the British Open on the world's original, and still most famous, golf course of St. Andrews.)

I had therefore viewed D'Arcy Thompson as the ultimate man out of time — a Greek geometer and classical scholar, a Victorian prose stylist at the dawn of modernism's lean and cynical attitude (for the first edition of Growth and Form appeared in 1917 in the midst of Word War I, while an­other and even more destructive war greeted the second edition of 1942; many historians have noted that, in a meaningfully ideological, rather than an arbitrarily calendrical, reckoning, the 20th century really begins with World War I and the end of illusions about progress and the benevolent hege­mony of European control).

I shall not try to rob D'Arcy Thompson of his genuine singularities, but when we place his biological views into the context of evolutionary debate in his own time, we find, underneath his quirky stylistic uniqueness, a standard critique of Darwinism based upon the common argument that natural selec­tion cannot fashion novel features, but can only eliminate the unfit, bolstered by a claim for saltation as a common mode in the origin of highly distinct taxa and anatomical groundplans. D'Arcy Thompson did link this standard critique to an uncommon solution — his central claim that physical forces shape adaptive form directly — but we should regard his theory as an unusual solution to the standard conundrums of his time, and not as an anachronistic importation from Pythagorean Greece, clothed in the prose of Dickens or Thackeray.

On Growth and Form is a weighty tome (793 pages in the original edition of 1917, enlarged to 1116 pages in 1942), but D'Arcy Thompson presents his central thesis as a tight argument, expressed in clear logical order, with proper attention to inherent difficulties — and, above all, artfully developed throughout. (My analysis here, with two labeled exceptions, follows the first edition.)

In a common conceit (in the non-pejorative sense of a fanciful device), sci­entists often clothe a truly radical idea in the falsely modest garb of merely useful technicality. Thus, D'Arcy Thompson asserts that he wrote Growth and Form only to make biologists a bit more comfortable with the mathemat­ical description of morphology. He states in his epilog (1917, p. 778):

The fact that I set little store by certain postulates (often deemed to be fundamental) of our present-day biology the reader will have discovered and I have not endeavored to conceal. But it is not for the sake of polemi­cal argument that I have written, and the doctrines which I do not sub­scribe to I have only spoken of by the way. My task is finished if I have been able to show that a certain mathematical aspect of morphology, to which as yet the morphologist gives little heed, is interwoven with his problems, complementary to his descriptive task, and helpful, nay es­sential, to his proper study and comprehension of Form. Hie artem remumque repono.*



Beginning his assault upon biological traditions of explanation, D'Arcy Thompson reminds us that we feel no discomfort in ascribing the elegant and well-fitting forms of inorganic objects to physical forces that can mold them directly, and that also embody the advantage (for our comprehension) of sim­ple mathematical description. Why, then, when organic forms display equally elegant and simple geometries, and when these biological shapes also match the expected impress of physical forces, do we shy from invoking the same explanation of direct production that we apply without hesitation to identical forms in nonorganic nature? (1917, pp. 7-8):

The physicist proclaims aloud that the physical phenomena which meet us by the way have their manifestations of form, not less beautiful and scarce less varied than those which move us to admiration among living things. The waves of the sea, the little ripples on the shore, the sweeping curve of the sandy bay between its headlands, the outline of the hills, the shape of the clouds, all these are so many riddles of form, so many prob­lems of morphology, and all of them the physicist can more or less easily read and adequately solve: solving them by reference to their antecedent phenomena, in the material system of mechanical forces to which they belong, and to which we interpret them as being due...

Nor is it otherwise with the material forms of living things. Cell and tissues, shell and bone, leaf and flower, are so many portions of matter, and it is in obedience to the laws of physics that their particles have been moved, molded and conformed . . . Their problems of form are in the first instance mathematical problems, and their problems of growth are essentially physical problems, and the morphologist is, ipso facto, a stu­dent of physical science.



Our reluctance, D'Arcy Thompson claims, arises largely from conventional beliefs about the “special” character of life, based on a traditional assump­tion that organic shapes embody purposes and therefore demand teleological explanation, whereas inorganic forms exert no action of their own, and can only be explained as passive records of physical forces. We assert organic uniqueness by invoking both an active and passive argument. The passive ar­gument sets living things apart, without specifying any uniquely biological causes or processes (p. 2):

The reasons for this difference lie deep, and in part are rooted in old tra­ditions. The zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining, in mathe­matical language, even the simpler organic forms. When he finds a sim­ple geometrical construction, for instance in the honey-comb, he would fain refer it to psychical instinct or design rather than to the operation of physical forces; when he sees in snail, or nautilus, or tiny foraminiferal or radiolarian shell, a close approach to the perfect sphere or spiral, he is prone, of old habit, to believe that it is after all something more than a spiral or a sphere, and that in this “something more” there lies what nei­ther physics nor mathematics can explain. In short he is deeply reluctant to compare the living with the dead, or to explain by geometry or by dy­namics the things, which have their part in the mystery of life.



Biologists then advance the active argument to posit a set of distinctively organic causes that, in their outcomes, mimic the same forms that physical forces, left to their own devices, would impose upon any plastic material. At this point, D'Arcy Thompson introduces his critique of Darwinism and of functionalist evolutionary thought in general. In the paragraph following the last citation, D'Arcy Thompson identifies the two main culprits in our errone­ous convictions about special biological forces behind good organic design: phyletic solutions (or any kind of historical explanation), and adaptationist speculation leading to false assumptions about the need for such functionalist mechanisms as natural selection (pp. 2-3):

He [the morphologist] has the help of many fascinating theories within the bounds of his own science, which, though a little lacking in precision, serve the purpose of ordering his thoughts and of suggesting new objects of enquiry. His art of classification becomes a ceaseless and an endless search after the blood relationships of things living, and the pedigrees of things dead and gone. The facts of embryology become ... a record not only of the life-history of the individual but of the annals of its race . . . Every nesting bird, every anthill or spider's web displays its psychologi­cal problems of instinct or intelligence. Above all, in things both great and small, the naturalist is rightfully impressed, and finally engrossed, by the peculiar beauty, which is manifested in apparent fitness or “adapta­tion,” — the flower for the bee, the berry for the bird.



For all its Victorian amplitude, D'Arcy Thompson usually imposes ade­quate restraint upon his literary talents. But he does occasionally soar “over the top,” and nothing incites this tendency more than his aversion to Dar­winian speculation in the adaptationist mode — as in the following example (pp. 671-672):

Some dangerous and malignant animals are said (in sober earnest) to wear a perpetual war paint. The wasp and the hornet, in gallant black and gold, are terrible as an army with banners; and the Gila Monster (the poison-lizard of the Arizona desert) is splashed with scarlet — its dread and black complexion stained with heraldry more dismal. But the wasp-like livery of the noisy, idle hover-flies and drone-flies is but stage armour, and in their tinsel suits the little counterfeit cowardly knaves mimic the fighting crew.

The jewelled splendour of the peacock and the humming-bird, and the less effulgent glory of the lyrebird and the Argus pheasant, is ascribed to the unquestioned prevalence of vanity in the one sex and wantonness in the other.

The zebra is striped that it may graze unnoticed on the plain, the tiger that it may lurk undiscovered in the jungle; the banded Chaetodont and Pomacentrid fishes are further bedizened to the hues of the coral reefs in which they dwell. The tawny lion is yellow as the desert sand; but the leopard wears its dappled hide to blend, as it crouches on the branch, with the sun-flecks peeping through the leaves...

To buttress the action of natural selection the same instances of “adaptation” (and many more) are used, which in an earlier but not distant age testified to the wisdom of the creator and revealed to simple piety the high purpose of God.



At this turning point in his argument, D'Arcy Thompson calls upon his ex­pertise in classics to invoke Aristotle's exegesis of causality in his favor. We may acknowledge that biological forms embody “purposes” expressed as adaptive utility in the Darwinian struggle for life (“final causes” in Aristotle's terminology, with “final” referring to utilitarian, not temporal, ends). The Darwinian functionalist, D'Arcy Thompson then claims, makes his key er­ror in assuming that the identification of utility (final cause) automatically specifies the process by which such utility originates — a false inference from purpose to mechanism. But, as Aristotle pointed out, a full explanation for natural objects and phenomena requires the identification of several distinct kinds of causes. In particular, the final cause (utility) of an object does not specify the efficient cause, or mechanism, that actually (and actively) con­structed the object (“efficient,” that is, in the technical sense of making or “effecting,” rather than the more restricted vernacular sense of doing some­thing well).

When we identify “not sinking into the mud” as the adaptive value (final cause) of webbing on the feet of shore birds, we have not proven thereby that the efficient cause of webbing must be functionalist in nature, and explicitly tied to the purpose (final cause) now served by this feature. After all, web­bing might have arisen by any one of numerous, and entirely plausible, non-functionalist mechanisms (or by functionalist mechanisms unrelated to cur­rent utility for standing on mud) — and then been happily and fortuitously available for cooptation to its current purpose. D'Arcy Thompson preferred efficient causes of direct physical imposition (an improbable alternative in this particular case), but his general point cannot be gainsaid. The correct de­scription of a final cause does not, by itself, identify the mechanism by which this utility originated (p. 5):

The use of the ideological principle is but one way, not the whole or the only way, by which we may seek to learn how things came to be, and to take their places in the harmonious complexity of the world. To seek not for ends but for “antecedents” is the way of the physicist, who finds “causes” in what he has learned to recognize as fundamental properties, or inseparable concomitants, or unchanging laws, of matter and of en­ergy. In Aristotle's parable, the house is there that men may live in it; but it is also there because the builders have laid one stone upon another: and it is as a mechanism, or a mechanical construction, that the physicist looks upon the world. Like warp and woof, mechanism and teleology are interwoven together, and we must not cleave to the one and despise the other.



Moving from Aristotle to his own nation's greatest philosopher at the dawn of modern science, D'Arcy Thompson then cites Bacon's famous dis­paragement of final causes (as vestal virgins with empty downturned cups) falsely cited to explain mechanisms of production (pp. 5-6) — and he blames a knee-jerk style of Darwinian adaptationism for this common conflation in evolutionary science (that is, for erroneous assumptions that functional utili­ties automatically identify structural or mechanical origins by natural selec­tion):

Nevertheless, when philosophy bids us hearken and obey the lessons both of mechanical and of teleological interpretation, the precept is hard to follow: so that oftentimes it has come to pass, just as in Bacon's day, that a leaning to the side of the final cause “hath intercepted the severe and diligent inquiry of all real and physical causes,” and has brought it about that “the search of the physical cause hath been neglected and passed in silence.” So long and so far as “fortuitous variation” and the “survival of the fittest” remain engrained as fundamental and satisfac­tory hypotheses in the philosophy of biology, so long will these “satisfac­tory and specious causes” tend to stay “severe and diligent inquiry,” “to the great arrest and prejudice of future discovery.”



D'Arcy Thompson's citation of Bacon's famous critique does not imply any personal distaste for the subject of excellent adaptation or final causation in general. Quite to the contrary, D'Arcy Thompson's focus on geometric beauty and mechanical optimality led him to emphasize the loveliest and most stunningly efficient of organic designs. Thus, his complaint did not lie with the existence of adaptation, but with the too-facile Darwinian assump­tion that such final causes imply a mode of construction explicitly powered by the value of the developing adaptation itself — in other words, a function­alist mechanism like natural selection. The nub of D'Arcy Thompson's system, and his reason for emphasizing the different statuses of efficient and final causation, resides in his conviction that efficient causes of physical construc­tion craft final causes as automatic consequences — thus obviating the need for a special category of mechanisms (again like natural selection) to explain biological adaptation. D'Arcy Thompson expresses his admiration and feel­ing for final causes in one of his loveliest prose flourishes (p. 3):

Time out of mind, it has been by way of the “final cause,” by the teleo­logical concept of “end,” of “purpose,” or of “design,” in one or an­other of its many forms (for its moods are many), that men have been chiefly wont to explain the phenomena of the living world; and it will be so while men have eyes to see and ears to hear withal. With Galen, as with Aristotle, it was the physician's way; with John Ray, as with Aris­totle, it was the naturalist's way; with Kant as with Aristotle, it was the philosopher's way. It was the old Hebrew way, and has its splendid set­ting in the story that God made “every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew.” It is a common way, and a great way; for it brings with it a glimpse of a great vision, and it lies deep as the love of nature in the hearts of men.



As the last step in his general argument, D'Arcy Thompson then asks us to consider how far the simplest and most direct style of efficient causation might carry us in explaining adaptive organic form. Perhaps many features owe their geometric optimality — leading to maximization of utility, or final cause, as well — to the simplest mechanism of direct shaping by the physical forces most relevant to the behaviors of the organism in its daily struggles for life. By invoking an analogy to the limits of science in aesthetic and moral arguments, D'Arcy Thompson allows that his favored theme of physical impo­sition may not carry us as far as we (or at least he) would like to go. But he makes a strong argument for this kind of minimalism (final causes generated by physical imposition, thus obviating the need for special mechanisms to se­cure adaptation) as an appropriate first approach (pp. 8-9):

How far, even then, mathematics will suffice to describe, and physics to explain, the fabric of the body no man can foresee. It may be that all the laws of energy, and all the properties of matter, and all the chemistry of all the colloids are as powerless to explain the body, as they are impotent to comprehend the soul. For my part, I think it is not so. Of how it is that the soul informs the body, physical science teaches me nothing: con­sciousness is not explained to my comprehension by all the nerve-paths and “neurons” of the physiologist; nor do I ask of physics how goodness shines in one man's face, and evil betrays itself in another. But of the con­struction and growth and working of the body, as of all that is of the earth earthy, physical science is, in my humble opinion, our only teacher and guide.





The tactic and application of an argument


D'Arcy Thompson followed a definite strategy in attempting to carve out the largest possible empirical role for his “minimalist” structural theory on the genesis of good design and adaptive form in organisms. He would begin with his best “shot” — the outward shapes of simple unicellular organisms — and then sally forth from this plausible beginning. Again, he initiates the search in his overtly modest mode (p. 10): “My sole purpose is to correlate with mathe­matical statement and physical law certain of the simpler outward phenom­ena of organic growth and structure or form: while all the while regarding, ex hypothesi, for the purposes of this correlation, the fabric of the organism as a material and mechanical configuration.”

The empirical chapters of Growth and Form embody this plan by first elucidating a most promising principle (surface/volume ratios), applying it to a best potential case (protistan form), and then moving from this position of initial strength into ever less likely realms of application, always trying to capture the largest possible domain for explaining final causes (adaptive forms) as automatic consequences of the direct action of physical forces (ef­ficient causes) upon yielding organic material.

After a short introductory statement, presenting the basic argument as summarized in my preceding pages, D'Arcy Thompson composes two lengthy chapters to set a context for the empirical cases to follow. The first, entitled “on magnitude” and devoted to an elegant explication, still read in many un­dergraduate courses, of Galileo's principle of necessarily declining surface/volume ratios as geometrically similar objects increase in size, holds a central place in the logic of D'Arcy Thompson's general theory. (Ironically, many of the most fervent admirers of this chapter, especially those who encounter it out of context in a book of course readings, have no inkling of its anchoring purpose in a much broader theory that they would, no doubt, heartily reject.) If physical forces shape organisms directly, then our best test resides in the preeminence of the S/V principle, and the linear scaling of this ratio with in­creasing organismal size. Tiny animals must dwell in a world dominated by forces acting upon their surfaces, while large animals will be ruled by gravita­tional forces operating upon volumes. We can therefore test the efficacy of physical forces by noting whether organisms show the “right” conformations for direct molding by the appropriate relative strengths of these forces at their size.

The following chapter, entitled “the rate of growth,” then develops the dy­namic argument that physical forces will be exerted upon vectors of growth during an organism's ontogeny, not merely upon a realized final form. The subsequent 15 chapters then follow a sequence, beginning with single cells, where growth plays a minimal role and forms may be construed as simple re­sponses to a small number of constraining conditions and imposing forces, as in D'Arcy Thompson's most famous comparison (Figure 11-1) of protistan cells to Plateau's surfaces of revolution — a set of shapes exhibiting minimal areas in designs that are radially symmetrical about a single axis.

D'Arcy Thompson then moves on to simple aggregations of cells or units, but proceeding no “further” (up the traditional chain of complexity) than fairly uniform tissues of a single organ, minimally differentiated metazoans like sponges, and colonial organisms made of similar units crowded together. He presents a wide taxonomic range of putative cases for direct mechanical construction, but with strong emphasis upon the most plausible circumstance of geometric forms automatically engendered by closest packing of mallea­ble units of the same basic size and composition (the “soap-bubble” para­digm, if you will) — including an ingenious analysis of sponge and holothurian spicules as mineralized maps of the junctions between units, and not as

phyletically unique and distinctive forms (Figure 11-2); an explanation of honeycomb cells as optimal balances of strength and holding capacity; and a convincing claim that the hexagonal closest packing of corallites in Paleo­zoic colonial rugosans cannot be read as distinctive phyletic adaptations of particular lineages, because corallites assume circular cross sections when they grow in less confined spaces with no contact between individuals (Fig­ure 11-3).

In a third category, D'Arcy Thompson then considers geometrically regular growth patterns of more complex creatures in cases where an observed order might record the operation of a simple building principle plausibly regulated by direct mechanical production — as in his most famous chapter on the loga­rithmic spiral (mainly in molluscan shells, but also for unicellular forams and ruminant horns) as the paradigm curve that increases in size without chang­ing its shape; and his largely derivative discussion of phyllotaxis, with obedi­ence to the Fibonacci series explained not as a Pythagorean mystery, but as an automatic consequence of initiating each new spiral in a radiating series by setting its founding element into the largest available space at the generating center.

But when, in a final set of cases, D'Arcy Thompson must discuss the com­plex features of “higher” metazoan phyla that cannot be reduced to conse­quences of single principles in growth — in other words, the difficult problems of morphology that have always been regarded as paramount to the enter­prise — he makes much less headway, and largely confines his attention to “peripheral” questions, including the ordering of differences among forms as expressions of relatively simple transformation gradients (but leaving the core form as an unexplained “primitive term” or “given” in the analysis), and the correlation of obviously ecophenotypic or epigenetic modifications (the healing of broken bones, for example) with forces acting upon the object dur­ing this secondary modification. (We shall see (pp. 1196–1200) how his in­ability to treat the shared properties of complex taxonomic Bauplane as more than unexplained inputs into his theory of transformation scuttles any hope that his system might enjoy controlling, or even general, application as a the­ory of biological form.)

To illustrate how D'Arcy Thompson applies his central argument across this empirical range, we should consider his own favored principle of surface/ volume ratios as an exemplar because the fundamental property of size itself establishes a basic prediction for testing the efficacy of physical forces. Allometric “corrections” and accommodations can only proceed so far, and small creatures should therefore be predominantly shaped by forces acting on sur­faces, and large animals by forces acting on volumes. Creatures of intermedi­ate size might record a “tug of war,” displaying the work of both sets. I there­fore consider three famous examples of sensible correlations with increasing size.

1. For tiny creatures living fully in the realm of surficial forces, D'Arcy Thompson documents the conformity of many organisms (across a wide tax­onomic spectrum) to the shape of “such unduloids as develop themselves when we suspend an oil-globule between two unequal rings, or blow a soap-bubble between two unequal pipes” (p. 247). (Obviously, D'Arcy Thompson must identify, in each case, the specific organic constraint corresponding to the two terminal rings of unequal size in his physical models. In one case, for example, he writes (p. 247) that “the surface of our Vorticella bell finds its terminal supports, on the one hand in its attachment to its narrow stalk, and on the other in the thickened ring from which spring its circumoral cilia.”)

I choose this case (Figure 11-4) because D'Arcy Thompson invoked the conformity of so many tiny organisms with the well-known and easily-produced unduloid to draw an explicit contrast between his explanatory preferences and the conventional Darwinian account of adaptive design (pp. 248–249) (note, especially, how he highlighted these differences for re­solving both the adaptive status of the basic form itself, and the genesis of a rich set of taxonomically designated variants upon the basic form):

Here we have an excellent illustration of the contrast between the differ­ent ways in which such a structure may be regarded and interpreted. The teleological explanation is that it is developed for the sake of protection, as a domicile and shelter for the little organism within. The mechanical explanation of the physicist (seeking only after the “efficient,” and not the “final” cause), is that it is present, and has its actual conformation, by reason of certain chemicophysical conditions: that it was inevitable, under the given conditions, that certain constituent substances actually present in the protoplasm should be aggregated by molecular forces in its surface layer; that under this adsorptive process, the conditions continu­ing favorable, the particles should accumulate and concentrate till they formed a membrane, thicker or thinner as the case might be; that this

membrane was inevitably bound, by molecular forces, to become a sur­face of the least possible area which the circumstances permitted; that in the present case, the symmetry and “freedom” of the system permitted, and ipso facto caused, this surface to be a surface of revolution; and that of the few surfaces of revolution which, as being also surfaces minimae areae, were available, the unduloid was manifestly the one permitted, and ipso facto caused, by the dimensions of the organisms. We also see that the actual outline of this or that particular unduloid is also a very subordinate matter, such as physico-chemical variants of a minute kind would suffice to bring about; for between the various unduloids which the various species of Vorticella represent, there is no more real differ­ence than that difference of ratio or degree which exists between two cir­cles of different diameter, or two lines of unequal length.



In cases like this, strict selectionists conventionally assert that no genuine problem exists, but only a conceptual or terminological confusion. After all, any devotee of natural selection knows that adaptive shapes must be ex­plained both in terms of survival value and immediate mode of construction. Therefore, the selectionist would continue, “I am happy to suppose that natu­ral selection built the adaptive unduloid by fostering the differential repro­ductive success of growth variants that could attain the advantageous form along a single dimension of selection, rather than by having to construct each property in a piecemeal fashion, character by character.”

In fact, selectionists can even cite a terminology to bolster their under­standing that any adaptation requires, for its full explication, an account of both survival value and mode of construction (which, in truth, only reflects Aristotle's old distinction of final and efficient causes, and might as well bear these names rather than their currently favored neologisms). Selectionists generally refer to these two complementary modalities as “ultimate” and “proximate” causes — often supposing that they have, by this terminology, won some preciously new insight to clear away the conceptual fog of centu­ries. However, as stated above, the distinction only codifies a particular ex­pression of Aristotle's argument on the multiple meanings and aspects of cau­sality.

Nonetheless, even if not new, this argument about the complementarity and non-oppositional nature of ultimate and proximate causation cannot be gainsaid — and Darwinians advance this point with complete justice. That is, when selectionists cite the adaptive advantage of a form, they surely do not deny the need for a different statement about the immediate mode of genetic and developmental origin in any individual as well. However, we also need to recognize that this legitimate defense of adaptationist language does not ap­ply to D'Arcy Thompson's point of genuine contention (logically genuine that is, not necessarily empirically correct in any given instance).

D'Arcy Thompson does not merely argue that he has found the mode by which natural selection worked to build adaptive unduloids. Rather, he ad­vances the radically different, and truly oppositional, argument that natural selection need not be invoked at all, and as any kind of cause in this case. For he holds that physical forces shaped the unduloid directly, without any selec­tion of favored forms from a range of variants. In other words, he believes that the efficient cause of mechanical imposition constructs the final cause au­tomatically, thus obviating the need for any separate and explicitly biological or functional explanation to fashion the adaptive shape of the unduloid. (In selectionist jargon, D'Arcy Thompson argues that the proximate cause fash­ions the ultimate cause all by itself, thus explaining two properties for the price of one mechanism. I also happen to think that D'Arcy Thompson was probably wrong in this case, and that the traditional Darwinian scheme, with different forms of explanation needed for ultimate and proximate causes, probably applies to this case. But, the logic of D'Arcy Thompson's argument remains sound.)

2. At intermediary sizes, the automatically realized forms of inorganic ob­jects often map the “conflicting” expressions of surficial forces holding things up and volumetric forces pulling them down. In a fascinating section added to the 2nd edition of 1942, D'Arcy Thompson studied drops of more viscid material falling through water. He compares the resulting forms (balancing surface tensions that retard descent and spread out the drops, with gravita­tional forces that pull the dense drops towards the bottom of the vessel) to the strikingly similar (and often quite complex) radially symmetrical shapes of jellyfishes (Figure 11-5). D'Arcy Thompson wrote (1942, pp. 397-398): “Not only do we recognize in a vorticoid drop a 'schema' or analog of medusoid form, but we seem able to discover various actual phases of the splash or drop in the all but innumerable living types of jellyfish ... It is hard indeed to say how much or little all these analogies imply. But they indicate, at the very least, how certain simple organic forms might be naturally as­sumed by one fluid mass within another, when gravity, surface tension and fluid friction play their part.”

3. At still larger sizes, surface tension becomes so negligible that rigid hard parts become necessary to maintain shape, lest gravity create a world of pancakes.

The dense protoplasm is pulled down by gravity, but sufficiently retarded in its fall to spread out under forces of surface tension. From D'Arcy Thompson, 1942.





In what may be his most famous example, D'Arcy Thompson proved a case of direct construction in response to immediate gravitational forces by showing that internal trabeculae in the head of the human femur strengthen the bone along the precise lines of its greatest need for buttressing against compressive forces — for when bones break and heal improperly, the tra­beculae are absorbed and then reform along lines of stress dictated by the limping walk of suboptimal reknitting. No one, in this case, could make the usual claim for phyletic determination by natural selection (at least not for these particular trabeculae in these unfavorable circumstances, although one might identify selection as the basis for this underlying lability in trabecular formation). D'Arcy Thompson writes (p. 687):

Our bone is not only a living, but also a highly plastic structure; the little trabeculae are constantly being formed and deformed, demolished and formed anew. Here, for once, it is safe to say that “heredity” need not and cannot be invoked to account for the configuration and arrangement of the trabeculae: for we can see them, at any time of life, in the making, under the direct action and control of the forces to which the system is exposed . . . Herein then lies, so far as we can discern it, a great part at least of the physical causation of what at first sight strikes us as a purely functional adaptation.





The admitted limitation and ultimate failure of an argument


As a common theme in the tragedies of human literature and history, entities of all sorts (from bodies, to cities, to structures of ideas) often unravel at the height of their apparent triumph, for the surface of success may fail to anchor any roots in the general substrate below. Embodied within the very undeniability of D'Arcy Thompson's explanation for the direct mechanical shap­ing of optimally positioned trabeculae in the human femur, we can also locate the source of a strictly limited applicability that D'Arcy Thompson himself eventually had to own.

After all, the trabeculae can be explained as direct consequences of immedi­ate mechanical forces because they cannot be construed as inherited aspects of a phenotype that might be subject to natural selection, or to any process of truly evolutionary modification for that matter. They represent labile re­sponses of the ontogenetic moment, and will therefore be subject to speci­fication by immediate forces (and, consequentially and crucially, not candi­dates for hereditary transmission in our non-Lamarckian earthly biology). But when we study stable and inherited features with equal claim to adaptive optimality — the main kinds of characters that theories of adaptive evolution try to explain — how can we make an equally strong case (or even a case of any plausibility at all) for their immediate construction by physical forces act­ing upon the organism during growth? Immediate physical forces may build my trabeculae, but how can they shape a set of stable and inherited traits that made a first appearance when I was a tiny embryo in utero, long before the gravitational forces to which these features are adapted could play any role in building my body by direct imposition?

D'Arcy Thompson had to face this critical problem head on — and he did so in a forthright manner by putting the best possible face upon adversity via two arguments that fatally compromised his dream of winning generality for his idiosyncratic theory of structuralist evolution from the outside. First and foremost, he simply admitted that his principle of direct imposition couldn't explain the complex forms of the multicellular phyla that, for however paro­chial a reason, have always defined the central subject and puzzlement of morphology. D'Arcy Thompson continued to maintain — and he may well have been right in some cases — that good matches between simple organic conformations (primarily the outward forms of unicellular creatures) and geometric shapes of well known mathematical definition and easily accom­plished mechanical construction probably illustrate his favored principle of direct imposition by physical forces. But he had to admit that he could not apply this line of reasoning to the basic form of a horse or a tuna.

Interestingly, he “came clean” on this point right after his strong argument about the production of unicellular unduloids by forces of surface tension (cited on p. 1193). He begins by quoting a conventional defense of phylogenetic reasoning by E. Ray Lankester, then refutes the argument for his un­duloids, but cannot deny its application to large and complex multicellular forms (pp. 251-252):

“The fact that we are able to classify organisms at all in accordance with the structural characteristics which they present is due to the fact of their being related by descent.” But this great generalisation is apt in my opinion, to carry us too far. It may be safe and sure and helpful and illu­minating when we apply it to such complex entities, — such thousand­fold resultants of the combination and permutation of many variable characters, — as a horse, a lion or an eagle; but (to my mind) it has a very different look, and a far less firm foundation, when we attempt to extend it to minute organisms whose specific characters are few and simple, whose simplicity becomes much more manifest when we regard it from the point of view of physical and mathematical description and analysis, and whose form is referable, or (to say the least of it) is very largely refer­able, to the direct and immediate action of a particular physical force.



But D'Arcy Thompson truly throws in the towel during the most poignant and appropriate round — right at the end of his last empirical chapter, as he reaches the apex of complexity in his analysis of vertebrate skeletons (chapter 16 “on form and mechanical efficiency”), and just before he recoups rele­vance in his brilliant final chapter on the theory of transformed coordinates. He begins by admitting that he cannot describe the skeleton as “a resultant of immediate and direct physical or mechanical conditions” precisely because the very biological principle that he has tried to deny (or at least to under­play) throughout the book — the phyletic inheritance, rather than immediate construction, of the underlying Bauplan — cannot be gainsaid at this level of complexity. (With refreshing candor, D'Arcy Thompson admits that he had tried his best “to circumscribe the employment of the latter [that is, of hered­ity] as a working hypothesis in morphology.”) D'Arcy Thompson writes, in his key statement (p. 715):

It would, I dare say, be a gross exaggeration to see in every bone nothing more than a resultant of immediate and direct physical or mechanical conditions; for to do so would be to deny the existence, in this connec­tion, of a principle of heredity. And though I have tried throughout this book to lay emphasis on the direct action of causes other than heredity, in short to circumscribe the employment of the latter as a working hy­pothesis in morphology, there can still be no question whatsoever but that heredity is a vastly important as well as a mysterious thing; it is one of the great factors in biology . . . But I maintain that it is no less an ex­aggeration if we tend to neglect these direct physical and mechanical modes of causation altogether, and to see in the characters of a bone merely the results of variation and of heredity, and to trust, in conse­quence, to those characters as a sure and certain and unquestioned guide to affinity and phylogeny.



This admission then leads to a recovery of relevance via the second argu­ment, presented in his last and, in the judgment of most biologists, his most important chapter “on the theory of transformations, or the comparison of related forms.” All professional evolutionists know D'Arcy Thompson's fa­mous diagrams of related organisms compared by imposing a Cartesian grid upon one form, treated as a reference, and then rendering other forms as re­sults of simple distortions and transformations of the grid lines (see Figure 11-6 for an example). But I think that most of us have not understood the logical and theoretical reasons behind D'Arcy Thompson's invention, largely because (as for the chapter “on magnitude”) we read this section out of con­text, and do not grasp its intimate relation (as an apotheosis, given the limita­tions he had to admit) to his general and idiosyncratic theory of form.

That is, we tend to interpret these Thompsonian transformed coordinates as a crude, and ultimately failed, attempt to operationalize (by pictorialization) a good intuition about the multivariate nature of evolutionary change before the development of appropriate statistical techniques, and the inven­tion of computers, permitted us to apply genuine multivariate mathematics to problems of form. Most of us, I think, envisage the deformed coordinate grid as a mere residuum of a qualitative analysis focused on the transformed bod­ies themselves — just a set of guidelines needed to make a crude map of the or­ganisms under consideration.

In so doing, we misunderstand D'Arcy Thompson's intention in a precisely backwards manner. His interest lay primarily in the lines of the stretched and deformed grids, for he had remained true to his theory that physical forces shape organisms directly. He had made a painful and necessary surrender of that theory — by bowing to conventional evolutionary resolutions in terms of heredity and phylogeny — for explaining the complex and intricately multivariate Bauplane of complex metazoan animals. In other words, he accepted that the basic designs must be admitted as “primitive terms” or “background conditions” within his theory — as “givens” to be acknowledged (and attrib­uted to other kinds of causes), and as basic inputs before any further analysis could be conducted in his favored terms.

In making such an admission D'Arcy Thompson swallowed a bitter pill. He had to accept the existence and contrary construction of “hipponess” or “eagleness” at the outset, and then to determine what field might be left to his favored causes of direct mapping by physical forces. The theory of trans­formed coordinates presents his positive approach to this dilemma, his at­tempt to keep his theory maximally relevant in the light of his enforced con­cession to historicism in general, and to Darwinism in particular. He could not lay claim to the basic forms themselves, but he would still make a play for the taxonomic variety produced by their transformations.

If the differences among related species could be expressed as simple distortions

To understand his view, we must recognize that these figures are meant to feature the transformation grid lines themselves — as indications of physical forces that directly impose phyletic changes upon the organisms. From D'Arcy Thompson, 1917.





of a grid, then the transformed grid itself would become a picture of the lines of forces responsible for the evolutionary deformation. Thus, D'Arcy Thompson valued the lines of the transformed grids above the altered organ­isms themselves, for he hoped that his pictures of simple and coordinated transformation would revivify his theory in a more limited domain. The lines of transformation would map the forces that converted the initial form into its descendants or relatives — and by D'Arcy Thompson's theory of direct im­position, those lines would then identify the geometric operation of the actual forces that caused the evolutionary changes by direct imposition. He would not win hipponess (or full happiness) for his theory, but he might encom­pass the set of realized variations upon hipponess. Put another way, perhaps D'Arcy Thompson could “have it all” for the simple forms of some unicells; but he would have to settle for the variations (leaving the fundamental con­figurations to history and heredity) when he treated the complexities of verte­brate organization.

Sweet indeed are the uses of adversity, as D'Arcy Thompson put his best possible spin upon a positive ending to a most unwelcome admission (p. 723):

But in a very large part of morphology, our essential task lies in the comparison of related forms rather than in the precise definition of each; and the deformation of a complicated figure may be a phenomenon easy of comprehension, though the figure itself have to be left unanalysed and undefined. This process of comparison, of recognising in one form a definite permutation or deformation of another, apart altogether from a precise and adequate understanding of the original “type” or standard of comparison, lies within the immediate province of mathematics, and finds its solution in the elementary use of a certain method of the mathe­matician. This method is the Method of Co-ordinates, on which is based the Theory of Transformations.





Odd Man In (D'Arcy Thompson's structuralist critique of

Darwinism) and Odd Man Out (his disparagement of historicism)


I premised this discussion by arguing that D'Arcy Thompson's showy singu­larity in both style and substance — the quirks and anachronisms that seem to place him “out of time” — must not blind us to the fact that these unique­nesses overlie a rather standard early 20th century structuralist critique of Darwinian functionalism. D'Arcy Thompson's residence within his own time therefore becomes as informative as his idiosyncrasies.

In particular, I have emphasized, throughout this book, the logical and al­most ineluctable linkage in structuralist thought between defenses of inter­nally channeled directionality and saltationist mechanics (as particularly ex­emplified in the definitive model of Galton's Polyhedron — see pp. 342–351). I have also stressed the equally tight relationship of these views to a critique of adaptations — not of their preeminent existence (which D'Arcy Thompson embraces and celebrates), but of their necessary construction “for” utility by a functionalist mechanism like natural selection (see my previous discussion of D'Arcy Thompson's contemporary, William Bateson, pp. 396–415).

On the theme of constraint, D'Arcy Thompson frequently argues that once one accepts a more than analogical comparison between the good designs, based on idealized geometry, of organic and inorganic objects, one must also defend (not apologetically, but for the utility of the conclusion in understand­ing anatomical order and taxonomic interrelationships) the limitation of or­ganic morphology to channels of transformation that the physical causes of morphogenesis must follow (p. 137): “The world of things living, like the world of things inanimate, grows of itself, and pursues its ceaseless course of creative evolution. It has room, wide but not unbounded, for variety of living form and structure, as these tend towards their seemingly endless, but yet strictly limited, possibilities of permutation and degree.”

Once these directing channels of evolution have been established by physi­cal forces governing the changes, we have no reason to restrict our concept of movement down these channels to the slow and continuous pacing of Darwinian gradualism. Relevant physical laws will regulate the path, “be the journey taken fast or slow.” In the following passage (p. 155), D'Arcy Thompson begins to link his model of channeled discontinuity to critiques of specific principles within evolutionary theory — in this case to the prevalent idea that similarities between ontogeny and phylogeny must arise for phyletic or historical reasons. Why introduce this “extra” and superfluous hypothesis, D'Arcy Thompson asks, if the same physical law, “caring little” whether it works during the growth of individuals or the evolution of lineages, man­dates the same changes in any separate case:

The differences of form, and changes of form, which are brought about by varying rates (or “laws”) of growth, are essentially the same phenom­enon whether they be, so to speak, episodes in the life-history of the indi­vidual, or manifest themselves as the normal and distinctive characteris­tics of what we call separate species of the race. From one form, or ratio of magnitude, to another there is but one straight and direct road of transformation, be the journey taken fast or slow; and if the transforma­tion take place at all, it will in all likelihood proceed in the self-same way, whether it occur within the life-time of an individual or during the long ancestral history of a race.



But for sheer iconoclasm, nothing in all of D'Arcy Thompson's prose matches the section that he added as “conclusion” to the chapter on trans­formed coordinates in the second (1942) edition of Growth and Form — a “great quotation” well worth citing in extenso. Here he makes his most inci­sive and forthright linkage between the two great structuralist themes of channeling and saltational discontinuity. Taxonomic groups of organisms may be compared (truly “homologized” in the conceptual sense of being reg­ulated by the same causal principle) with families of mathematical curves gen­erated by definite parameters of construction. Complete continuity may reign within a family, but the gaps between can only be crossed per saltum. D'Arcy Thompson emphasizes that “there is no argument against the theory of evo­lutionary descent” (1942, p. 1094) in such a concept, but he also maintains that this view of life's conformity to ordinary physical principles suggests a wide and radical range of non-Darwinian implications, including the rejec­tion of Darwin's views on imperfection of the geological record, a defense of saltational transition between Bauplane (contrasted with potential continuity of taxonomic order within), and a solution to the problem of life's inhomogeneous occupation of potential morphospace as an organic incarnation of real mathematical discontinuities in the geometry of nature.

There is one last lesson, which coordinate geometry helps us to learn.... In the study of evolution, and in all attempts to trace the descent of the animal kingdom, fourscore years' study of the Origin of Species has had an unlooked-for and disappointing result. ...

This failure to solve the cardinal problem of evolutionary biology is a very curious thing . . . We used to be told, and were content to believe, that the old record was of necessity imperfect — we could not expect it to be otherwise; the story was hard to read because every here and there a page had been lost or torn away . . . But there is a deeper reason. When we begin to draw comparisons between our algebraic curves and attempt to transform one into another, we find ourselves limited by the very nature of the case . . .

An algebraic curve has its fundamental formula, which defines the family to which it belongs ... With some extension of the meaning of pa­rameters, we may say the same of the families, or genera, or other classificatory groups of plants and animals . . . We never think of “transform­ing” a helicoid into an ellipsoid, or a circle into a frequency-curve. So it is with the forms of animals. We cannot transform an invertebrate into a vertebrate, nor a coelenterate into a worm, by any simple and legitimate deformation...

A “principle of discontinuity,” then, is inherent in all our classifica­tions, whether mathematical, physical or biological; and the infinitude of possible forms, always limited, may be further reduced and discontinuity further revealed ... The lines of the spectrum, the six families of crystals, Dalton's atomic law, the chemical elements themselves, all illustrate this principle of discontinuity. In short, nature proceeds from one type to an­other among organic as well as inorganic forms; and these types vary ac­cording to their own parameters, and are defined by physico-mathematical conditions of possibility. In natural history Cuvier's “types” may not be perfectly chosen nor numerous enough, but types they are; and to seek for stepping-stones across the gaps between is to seek in vain, for­ever. ...

Our geometrical analogies weigh heavily against Darwin's concep­tion of endless small continuous variations; they help to show that dis­continuous variations are a natural thing, that “mutations” — or sud­den changes, greater or less — are bound to have taken place, and new “types” to have arisen, now and then. Our argument indicates, if it does not prove, that such mutations [occur] on comparatively few definite lines, or plain alternatives, of physico-mathematical possibility.



If D'Arcy Thompson ended the final chapter on transformed coordinates with his most trenchant critique of Darwinian functionalism, he also lets us know, within the body of the chapter, that he built his entire theory as an alternative to the major implication of Darwinism for the daily practice of evolutionary biology and our conventional manner of conceptualizing organ­isms — for Darwinism implies separability of traits, and the subsequent poten­tial for their independent optimization by natural selection, whereas the very possibility of relating creatures by such simple transformation grids points to structural channeling by overarching laws of growth (p. 727):

This independent variability of parts and organs . . . would appear to be implicit in our ordinary accepted notions regarding variation; and, un­less I am greatly mistaken, it is precisely on such a conception of the easy, frequent, and normal independent variability of parts that our concep­tion of the process of natural selection is fundamentally based ... But if, on the other hand, diverse and dissimilar fishes can be referred as a whole to identical functions of very different coordinate systems, this fact will of itself constitute a proof that variation has proceeded on definite and orderly lines, that a comprehensive “law of growth” has pervaded the whole structure in its integrity, and that some more or less simple and recognisable system of forces has been at work.



In discussing morphological variety among Radiolaria, where he suspects that realized taxonomic diversity most closely approaches the filling of all slots permitted by generating laws of form, D'Arcy Thompson extends his critique to the ultimate step of even doubting whether many configurations, as occupants of geometrically attainable positions in a predictable series, even need to be interpreted as adaptive at all (p. 607):

In few other groups do we seem to possess so nearly complete a picture of all possible transitions between form and form, and of the whole branching system of the evolutionary tree: as though little or nothing of it had ever perished, and the whole web of life, past and present, were as complete as ever. It leads one to imagine that these shells have grown ac­cording to laws so simple, so much in harmony with their material, with their environment, and with all the forces internal and external to which they are exposed, that none is better than another and none fitter or less fit to survive. It invites one also to contemplate the possibility of the lines of possible variation being here so narrow and determinate that identical forms may have come independently into being again and again.



D'Arcy Thompson bases these critiques of natural selection directly upon his own idiosyncratic theory of form. But, in his more conventional partici­pation in the general debate of his time, he also presents the standard anti-Darwinian arguments that prevailed within evolutionary biology before the Modern Synthesis reinstated natural selection at the center of the subject. In a brief commentary on the extinction of dinosaurs, for example, D'Arcy Thompson reiterates the common claim that natural selection, although a genuine force in evolution, can only play the minor and negative role of elimi­nating the unfit, and not the central part of creating the fit. “We begin to see,” he states (p. 137), “that it is in order to account, not for the appearance, but for the disappearance of such forms as these that natural selection must be in­voked.” He then embellishes the argument with one of his characteristic prose flourishes (pp. 137-138):

But there comes a time when “variation,” in form, dimensions, or other qualities of the organism, goes farther than is compatible with all the means at hand of health and welfare for the individual and the stock; when, under the active and creative stimulus of forces from within and from without, the active and creative energies of growth pass the bounds of physical and physiological equilibrium: Then, at last, we are entitled to use the customary metaphor, and to see in natural selection an inexo­rable force, whose function is not to create but to destroy, — to weed, to prune, to cut down, and to cast into the fire.



But if this general and multifaceted critique of Darwinian functionalism — arising from his contrary structuralist account of the direct production of adaptive form by physical forces — harmonized well with major trends of thought in the evolutionary biology of his generation, the second prominent implication that he drew from his idiosyncratic theory of form could not have stood in more oppositional relationship to an even deeper, and even more general, assumption of the evolutionary sciences, both in D'Arcy Thompson's day and in our own. For D'Arcy Thompson used his theory to disparage, in­deed virtually to abolish, phylogenetic reasoning and historical explanations in general. He did not, of course, deny that phylogeny happened, and that a tree of life existed; and he did not challenge the fact that each species stands atop a historical series of ancestral forms. But he did argue that these com­mon features of biological reality possessed virtually no explanatory value for understanding either the morphology of individual species, or the anatomical relationships among species, as depicted in his own diagrams of transformed coordinates.

For if immediate physical forces shape the adaptive configurations of each modern species directly, then what relevance can be found in extinct ancestral shapes that responded to different physical forces of prior times, and that do not constrain the current forms of their descendants? The sensible, rational, and constrained order of related living forms in taxonomic groups represents a set of realizable positions within the mathematical boundaries of laws that currently shape the relevant organisms, not a set of phyletic constraints inher­ited from the past and now resident within organisms in the form of inherited genetic and developmental patterns that limit and channel the taxonomic structure of the living world.

For these reasons, I have labeled D'Arcy Thompson's “physicalist” and “externalist” form of structuralism as deeply out of harmony with the inter­nalist and historically based theories of structural constraint that are now en­joying such a revival within evolutionary theory, and that constitute the sub­ject of the rest of this chapter. I have also not hidden my general approbation for these more popular internalist and historicist versions. Paleontologists are, after all, historians at heart and by profession, and I regard historical causation as the most powerful and distinctive mode of reasoning — indeed the raison d'etre — of the evolutionary sciences. But I must also confess my lifelong attraction to the prose, and the chutzpah, behind D'Arcy Thompson's iconoclasm. His work has much to teach us, although I do not think that his general theory of form can be validated as more than a peripheral aid and sec­ondary shaper within a primary nexus of historicism.

In any case, D'Arcy Thompson wrote many of his stylistically strongest and philosophically most interesting disquisitions in a form that can only be labeled as “riffs” for different taxonomic groups on the common subject of the irrelevance of phylogeny in general, and the uselessness of Darwinian mechanisms in particular, for explaining either their anatomical ground plan or the ordered array of forms defining their taxonomic structure. He presents variants on the same riff for unduloid protists, radiolarians, and the hard parts of foraminifers, sponge spicules, bird eggs, the multifarious variations in shape among species of Mesozoic ammonoids, and the spiral patterns of stems in climbing plants.

For example, in the final paragraph of his chapter on logarithmic spirals, D'Arcy Thompson notes that the same set of varieties upon this universal curve populate the seas throughout Phanerozoic times. Therefore, he can't help wondering whether molluscan shells of this form can be meaningfully parsed into historical series of descent, or even accorded particular adaptive values (p. 586):

Again, we find the same forms, or forms which (save for external orna­ment) are mathematically identical, repeating themselves in all periods of the world's geological history; and, irrespective of climate or local condi­tions, we see them mixed up, one with another, in the depths and on the shores of every sea. It is hard indeed (to my mind) to see where Natural Selection necessarily enters in, or to admit that it has had any share whatsoever in the production of these varied conformations. Unless in­deed we use the term Natural Selection in a sense so wide as to deprive it of any purely biological significance; and so recognise as a sort of natural selection whatsoever nexus of causes suffices to differentiate between the likely and the unlikely, the scarce and the frequent, the easy and the hard: and leads accordingly, under the peculiar conditions, limitations and re­straints which we call “ordinary circumstances,” one type of crystal, one form of cloud, one chemical compound, to be of frequent occurrence and another to be rare.



In my opinion, D'Arcy Thompson's most powerful statement (also most likely to include important elements of validity) occupies several pages at the end of his next chapter 12 “on the spiral shells of the foraminifera.” In this “conclusion” (pp. 607-611), he decries the standard tendency of the time (now happily abandoned, but mostly for reasons other than D'Arcy Thomp­son's critique) to establish speculative phylogenies not so much on stratigraphic successions, but on idealized series moving from simple forms like the spherical Orbulina to ever more complex designs, and with attributions of in­creasing adaptive value (usually for greater test strength) to these more elabo­rate forms. Instead, D'Arcy Thompson views the diversity of foram shells as so many incarnations of permitted designs under the shaping rules that ac­tually direct the building of tests. Since these rules do not change through time, the potential forms remain immanent in nature, and become occupied again and again, throughout the history of the entire lineage, by various clades that fall under the relevant set of forces. These forms are therefore no more arrangeable from worse to better, and no more subject to specific ac­counts of historical filiation, than are the varied shapes of snowflakes or quartz crystals. (I particularly like this “riff” because D'Arcy Thompson ad­mits that phylogenies for complex metazoans may be better founded, and be­cause he may well be right that, for these simplest creatures of the fossil re­cord, repeated shapes in widely separated times and places may represent massive homoplasy based on the ease of revolving certain basic designs. Af­ter all, a hippo is only a hippo and will evolve just once, but the form of a mi­croscopic calcareous sphere, floating in the ocean, may be attainable along many routes — pp. 610-611):

The theorem of Organic Evolution is one thing; the problem of decipher­ing the lines of evolution, the order of phylogeny, the degrees of relation­ships and consanguinity, is quite another. Among the higher organisms we arrive at conclusions regarding these things by weighing much cir­cumstantial evidence, by dealing with the resultant of many variations, and by considering the probability or improbability of many coinci­dences of cause and effect...

But in so far as forms can be shown to depend on the play of physical forces, and the variations of form to be directly due to simple quantita­tive variations in these, just so far are we thrown back on our guard be­fore the biological conception of consanguinity, and compelled to revise the vague canons, which connect classification with phylogeny.

The physicist explains in terms of the properties of matter, and classi­fies according to a mathematical analysis, all the drops and forms of drops and associations of drops, all the kinds of froth and foam, which he may discover among inanimate things; and his task ends there. But when such forms, such conformations and configurations, occur among living things, then at once the biologist introduces his concepts of hered­ity, of historical evolution, of succession in time ... if fitness for a func­tion, of adaptation to an environment, of higher and lower, of “better” and “worse.” This is the fundamental difference between the “explana­tions” of the physicist and those of the biologist.

In the order of physical and mathematical complexity there is no question of the sequence of historic time. The forces that bring about the sphere, the cylinder or the ellipsoid are the same yesterday and to­morrow. A snow-crystal is the same to-day as when the first snows fell. The physical forces which mould the forms of Orbulina, of Astrorhiza, of Lagena or of Nodosaria to-day were still the same, and for aught we have reason to believe the physical conditions under which they worked were not appreciably different, in that yesterday which we call the Creta­ceous epoch; or, for aught we know, throughout all that duration of time which is marked, but not measured, by the geological record.





An epilog to an argument


We can, today, easily identify D'Arcy Thompson's primary error as an expres­sion of the venerable post hoc fallacy (“after this, therefore because of this”). He had correctly noted a strong correlation, throughout organic nature, be­tween the forms of organisms and the shapes that inorganic objects assume under direct molding by physical causes acting upon them. He therefore ad­vocated the simplest hypothesis that these physical causes had directly fash­ioned the organic forms (just as we would unhesitatingly assert for inorganic objects). Here he made an empirical rather than a logical error. That is, we cannot accuse D'Arcy Thompson of not recognizing the potential fallacy of drawing a causal inference (direct physical production) from the observation of a correlation (between realized organic forms and the idealized optima constructed by these physical forces in the inorganic realm). He understood perfectly well that biologists preferred a different and more complex expla­nation for the same generality — that the inorganic objects may be directly crafted, but that organisms generally achieve the same result by operation of a different kind of biological force, natural selection working by differential reproductive success and survival of the fittest. In the following passage, for example, D'Arcy Thompson separates the two arguments: first, the false inference of direct organic production, followed by the correct observation that organic forms obey physical laws (p. 10): “We want to see how, in some cases at least, the forms of living things, and of the parts of living things, can be explained by physical considerations, and to realise that, in general, no organic forms exist save such as are in conformity with ordinary physical laws.”

In other words, and using D'Arcy Thompson's favored Aristotelian termi­nology, he tried to depict the physical laws to which organic shapes conform so well as the actual efficient causes of these shapes. But, in general, Darwin­ians were right all along. These physical laws are formal causes, or blueprints of optimal adaptive designs for given circumstances of size, materials and ecology. The laws give us insight into the adaptive values, or final causes, of organic designs. But the efficient cause of good organic design is usually natu­ral selection.

Ironically, this great student of Aristotle (D'Arcy Thompson wrote stan­dard translations, still in print, for two of Aristotle's biological treatises) guessed wrong about the category of causes embodied in the correlation of organic shapes with the optimal forms directly produced by physical forces. He regarded the correlation as a map of the actual efficient cause. This aspect of good organic design does express a final cause in adaptation, but any evolutionary changes must still must be crafted by an efficient cause — and Darwinian natural selection generally acts as the efficient cause we seek for our explanations.

But before we dismiss Growth and Form as a brilliant and wonderfully written disquisition rooted in a central error, we should pause to reflect upon the partial validity of D'Arcy Thompson's theory of direct impress, or “order for free” in current parlance (Kauffman, 1993). D'Arcy Thompson admitted that he could not apply his theory to explain the groundforms of complex creatures, which he then accepted as “givens” in his analysis of transformed coordinates. This admission scuttled more of his hopes for generality than he was ever willing to acknowledge. But D'Arcy Thompson's theory cannot be rejected as entirely, or even generally, wrong. Surely his arguments for the hexagonal forms of crowded corallites, and the conformity of the ends of hive cells to the Maraldi angle, are correct: organisms don't have genes “for” hexagonality per se. Developmental genetics may regulate the types of materials, and their rates and places of production. But hexagonal shapes probably arise, just as for inorganic materials in similar conditions, by direct shaping under laws of closest packing.

I am confident that biologists can trace the lineage of hippos deep into an artiodactyl past in the early Cenozoic — as a genuine historical particular of unique form, requiring a phylogenetic explanation. But when someone tells me that a particular form of bacterium has not changed for 3.5 billion years because the oldest of all fossils displays the same shape as some modern spe­cies, then I doubt that this correct observation teaches me anything about filiation in a particular and continuous lineage; whereas I may learn some­thing about basic forms, homoplastically attained again and again during the history of life, and therefore bearing no particular phyletic message. And I may use D'Arcy Thompson's procedures to establish the probable reasons be­hind these shapes, whether or not my explanations lie in direct shaping by these physical forces (a strong possibility for the bacteria, but not for the hip­pos), or in the adaptive values of designs actually built by the efficient cause of natural selection.





ORDER FOR FREE AND REALMS OF RELEVANCE FOR

THOMPSONIAN STRUCTURALISM





In the most important modern work in the D'Arcy Thompsonian tradition, Kauffman (1993, p. 443) “invites our attention to the central theme of this [that is, his] book: Order in organisms may largely reflect spontaneous order in complex systems.” Kauffman retains strong feality to D'Arcy Thompson's central principle that the adaptive order of biological systems arises by di­rect imposition of physical forces — thus advocating an “externalist” form of structuralist thought that has not played a large role in the history of evolutionary biology. But Kauffman's specific insights and foci of concern differ widely from D'Arcy Thompson's emphasis upon morphometric geometry under laws of classical Newtonian dynamics. In the two major disparities, Kauffman first calls upon a different set of physical principles that has re­cently inspired both professional activity and public interest. In a second, and welcome, difference, Kauffman wishes to abet selection by supplying “order for free” from the inherent nature of the physical world, whereas D'Arcy Thompson tried to develop a largely substitutional theory of adaptive form that would relegate natural selection of effective insignificance.

In stating his fealty and staking out his differences, Kauffman (1993, p. 643) pays homage to D'Arcy Thompson and acknowledges the “small trickling of intellectual tradition” that this “outlier” species of structuralism has engendered, although Kauffman would surely wish to enlarge the flow to Mississippian proportions:

D'Arcy Thompson's famous and elegant book On Growth and Form stands as one of the best efforts to find aspects of organismic order which can be understood as aspects which we might, on good grounds, expect. His enquiry, which led him to consider minimal energy surfaces, trans­formations of coordinate systems as a function of differential growth, and a whole beautiful panoply of phenomena, has stood as a persistent spring for a small trickling of intellectual tradition down through con­temporary biology. Thompson applied classical physics to biology. It has been said that a weakness of some biologists is persistent physics-envy: the seeking of a deep structure to biology.



Kauffman then extols the virtues of physics-envy, while recommending that biologists redirect their jealousy away from the Newtonian mechanics that D'Arcy Thompson revered (p. 644): “There is a new physics aborning, and it is time to again fall open victim to physics-envy. For want of a better name, the area which is emerging is something like a theory of complex systems ... This book is an effort to continue in Thompson's tradition with the spirit now animating parts of physics. It seeks origins of order in the generic properties of complex systems.”

By pluralizing his title, and by being even more explicit in his subtitle, Kauffman emphasizes his different aim of arranging a marriage between se­lection and inherent order, with the latter as the older and more experienced partner who encourages a younger spouse to invigorate and direct the united effort emerging from a preexisting substrate: The Origins of Order. Self-Organization and Selection in Evolution. “I have made bold to suggest that much of the order seen in organisms is precisely the spontaneous order in the systems of which we are composed. Such order has beauty and elegance, cast­ing an image of permanence and underlying law over biology. Evolution is not just 'chance caught on the wing.' It is not just a tinkering of the ad hoc, of bricolage, of contraption. It is emergent order honored and honed by selec­tion” (p. 644).

“My own aim,” Kauffman adds (p. 26), “is not so much to challenge as to broaden the neo-Darwinian tradition. For, despite its resilience, that tradition has surely grown without seriously attempting to integrate the ways in which simple and complex systems may spontaneously exhibit order.” “My aim throughout is to attempt to characterize . . . those aspects which may reflect the self-organized properties of the . . . system and those which reflect selec­tion — and to determine a way of recognizing the marriage between the two” (p. 407).

Kauffman continually invokes two key phrases to epitomize his under­standing of direct physical molding in the evolution of adaptive form in anat­omy, ontogeny and interacting biological systems in general. First, he seeks to explicate the spontaneous “order for free,” to which systems naturally con­form, and which provides natural selection with a rich substrate for fine-tun­ing and more specific molding. In stating his intentions for ontogeny, and re­calling his similar conclusions for ecosystems, Kauffman writes (p. 409). (I like his phrase “gratuitously present” as a description of order for free):

Highly constrained, poised cell types and ordered patterns of gene activ­ity, each able to change to only a few others, are gratuitously present in a vast class of genomic regulatory systems . . . The phase transition from one regime to another is governed by simple parameters of the system, such as richness of coupling among the variables. The order seen in on­togeny, I shall suggest, is just that which arises spontaneously in the pow­erfully ordered regime found in parallel-processing networks. Selection, I shall further suggest, by achieving genomic systems in the ordered regime near the boundary of chaos, is likely to have optimized the capacity of such systems to perform complex gene-coordination tasks and evolve ef­fectively.



In the other important book from the 1990's on this view of life, Goodwin (1994, p. 186) emphasizes the “generic” nature of order for free: “Much (and perhaps most) of the order that we see in living nature is an expression of properties intrinsic to complex dynamic systems organized by simple rules of interaction among large numbers of elements. This order is generic, and what we see in evolution may be primarily an emergence of states generic to the dy­namics of living systems.”

With his second phrase, Kauffman emphasizes evolvability rather than form or organization per se in arguing that biological systems naturally evolve to “adaptation at the edge of chaos.” He holds (p. 645) that “the capacity to evolve is itself subject to evolution and may have its own law­ful properties. The construction principles permitting adaptation, too, may emerge as universals. Adaptation to the edge of chaos is just such a candidate construction principle.” Kauffman continually stresses the abstract, general and timeless nature of those aspects of biological order that he would ascribe to “the nature of things” rather than to any distinctively organic mechanism like natural selection (which can then act upon the inherent and generic prop­erties to construct more specific utilities in particular environments).

For these reasons of non-competition at their different scales (generic order vs. specific design) and the sequential nature of their interaction (generic or­der as given, selective order as superimposed refinement), the structural order generated by physical necessity meshes well with the functional order built by natural selection (p. xv): “Selection achieves and maintains complex systems poised on the boundary, or edge, between order and chaos. These systems are best able to coordinate complex tasks and evolve in a complex environment. The typical, or generic, properties of such poised systems emerge as potential ahistorical universals in biology.”

I have emphasized throughout this section that the unusual structuralist theme of spontaneous order externally imposed by physical law (and there­fore so different from structuralism's conventional focus upon internal chan­neling set by phyletic history, and then encoded in genetic and developmental programs) enjoys its greatest potential strength in two areas where other styles of explanation either don't apply in principle, or have simply (and so far) failed to yield robust results: the origin of life and its early history up to the construction of a prokaryotic cell; and the explanation of broad, recur­rent, and potentially ahistorical, or at least not phylogenetically constrained, patterns (the form of ecological pyramids, rather than the particular top car­nivore resident thereupon, the right skewed distribution of life's complexity rather than the occupation of its realized neurological extremity by Homo sa­piens). The structure of Kauffman's book affirms these foci (and the resulting promise of this approach through noninterference with the large and legiti­mate domain of necessarily historical explanation).

Life's origin and precellular history occupies one of three major sections in The Origins of Order. Kauffman stresses his message of physical necessity in designating this set of chapters as “The Crystallization of Life.” He structures his argument by attacking a straw man that, at least in the understanding of most paleontologists, fell from popularity more than 20 years ago when the fossil record yielded cells of bacterial form in the most ancient sediments that could preserve organic structures (3.5 to 3.6 billion years old). But this old and superseded claim of exceedingly low probability for life's origin does serve as a convenient foil for Kauffman's (and virtually the entire profes­sion's) search for different answers rooted in the predictable and generic na­ture of organic chemistry and the physics of self-organizing systems (p. 285): “The second part of this book . . . explores a heretical possibility. The origin of life, rather than having been vastly improbable, is instead an expected col­lective property of complex systems of catalytic polymers and the mole­cules on which they act. Life, in a deep sense, crystallized as a collective self-reproducing metabolism in a space of possible organic reactions. If this is true, then the routes to life are many and its origin is profound, yet simple.”

Kauffman then devotes the other two sections of his book to the second theme of broad and timeless structural generalities behind the specific adap­tive solutions crafted by the functionalist mechanism of natural selection: Part 1 on models for interaction on rugged fitness landscapes, and Part 3 on the order of ontogeny. As an example of structural generality behind func­tional specificity, Kauffman's model predicts that the waiting time for successful long-step jumping to higher, but distant, adaptive peaks (contrasted with different rules for simple expansion to adjacent peaks) doubles after each suc­cessful transition, thus forecasting, for example, that if a first success emerges from two tries on average, the tenth will require a mean wait equal to the time needed for more than 1000 attempts. In this manner, and very sensibly in my opinion (see Gould, 1989c), Kauffman tries to account for the origin of all fossilizable metazoan phyla in the Cambrian explosion, followed by more than 500 million years featuring no further origin of body plans of such dis­tinctly different design. But this level of generality offers no insight into the particular historical questions of taxon and time that have always defined the guts and soul of biology: why arthropods, and why then rather than a billion years before or after (with the latter, contingently plausible, scenario preclud­ing my writing and your reading this book, among other differences between our actual world and innumerable sensible, but unrealized, alternatives).

In explicating this feature of broad generality for the legitimate realm of physical imposition and predictability, Kauffman (pp. 13-14) draws an apt analogy that cannot be denied, but that also identifies the limits of his favored approach:

There is no doubt that our awareness of historical contingency is proper. The question we must address is whether there might be statistical order within such historical processes. A loose analogy makes this point. Imag­ine a set of identical round-topped hills, each subjected to rain. Each hill will develop a particular pattern of rivulets, which branch and converge to drain the hill. Thus the particular branching pattern will be unique to each hill, a consequence of particular contingencies in rock placement, wind direction, and other factors. The particular history of the evolving pattern of rivulets will be unique to each hill. But viewed from above, the statistical features of the branching patterns may be very similar. There­fore, we might hope to develop a theory of the statistical features of such branching patterns, if not of the particular pattern on one hill.



An ironic solution to controversy between this form of timeless struc­turalism and historical particularism could emerge from a treaty that rigidly relegated each domain to its proper space within the analogy. But such a clearly defined and well-patrolled truce would also deprive biology of much interest and legitimate skirmishing, for our deepest puzzles and most fascinat­ing inquiries often fall into a no-man's land not clearly commanded by either party — while we must also admit (and treasure) our human inclination to ex­pand the domains of personally favored explanations (“pushing the enve­lope” in a favored cliche of our times). Historicists do claim that much of what we have often interpreted as timeless and predictable generality (with evolutionary “progress” towards some form of consciousness as a prominent example) truly falls into the domain of contingent, but still fully explainable, good fortune in the particular history of this specific planet (whatever the per­centage of inhabited worlds that eventually evolve consciousness in some form).

Similarly — for the subject would otherwise evoke no interesting debate — D'Arcy Thompson, Kauffman, Goodwin, and all biologists attracted to this view of life have extended their putative realm of predictable generality based on universal physical structure into examples coveted by historicists as cen­tral features of their domain. For example, I have no quarrel with Goodwin's (1994, p. 132) attribution of patterns in phyllotaxis, particularly the transi­tion from distichy to spiral ordering, to simple constraining geometries of necessary spatial filling based on the size and rate of origin for new units at the generating center — if only because the promiscuous phyletic scattering of these transitions, and their consequent correlation to immediate rates and sizes rather than to historical context, points to physical automaticity rather than to genealogical constraint. “The frequency of the different phyllotactic patterns in nature,” Goodwin writes, “may simply reflect the relative proba­bilities of the morphogenetic trajectories of the various forms and have little to do with natural selection.”

But I balk when Goodwin then wishes to extend this claim for physical generality to such a phyletically localized, complex, and historically particu­lar structure as the tetrapod limb (whereas I acknowledge, of course, the fas­cination and utility of recent data from evo-devo — see Chapter 10 — on gen­eral rules that this historical particular then uses to craft its uniquenesses). I don't deny Goodwin's following statement about generation from rules (1994, p. 155), but I would maintain that these particular rules originated as consequences of contingent events in vertebrate history (now expressed as regularities in the development of limb buds), and not as simple properties of the universal order of geometry: “Tetrapod limbs are defined as the set of possible forms generated by the rules of focal condensation, branching bifur­cation, and segmentation in the morphogenetic field of the limb bud. All forms are equivalent under transformations that use only these generative processes. With this we arrive at a logical definition of tetrapod limbs that is independent of history. The idea of a common ancestral form as a special structure occupying a unique branch point on the tree of life ceases to have taxonomic significance.”

Several colleagues have complained that phrases like “adaptation to the edge of chaos,” while incorporating some currently fashionable imagery and terminology, lack clear scientific definition and operational utility. I regard this judgment as overly harsh and would argue to the contrary, that Kauff­man and his colleagues at the Santa Fe Institute for the study of complex sys­tems are groping towards something important. If we have been unable, thus far, to achieve a rigorous formulation, we should at least recognize that sci­ence itself has been so tuned to other, largely reductionist, modes of thought, that the basic conceptual tools have never been developed. I welcome this ex­ploration in terra largely incognita and would only like to point out, in end­ing this section that the implications for evolutionary theory may extend even further than the major protagonists have recognized.

In particular, and for its engagement with a dominant theme of this book (the hierarchical reformulation of selectionist theory as the first leg on a tripod of Darwinian central logic), if species gravitate to a position of best pos­sible balance between optimization for the moment and flexibility for future change, then Darwinian organismic selection cannot directly fashion such ad­aptations with advantages only measurable in terms of capacity for success in the face of future environmental changes, a central component in Kauffman's concept of benefits provided by residence at the edge of chaos (p. 409): “Se­lection, I shall further suggest, by achieving genomic systems in the ordered regime near the boundary of chaos, is likely to have optimized the capacity of such systems to perform complex gene-coordination tasks and evolve effec­tively.” A Darwinian can argue that flexibility linked to future capacity for change arises exaptively as a lucky consequence of features actively evolved for immediate organismic advantage. But such capacities can also evolve by direct selection, at a higher level, for species-individuals who win differential reproductive success by their propensity for living through external crises that consign closely related species-individuals to extinction.





Exapting the Rich and Inevitable Spandrels of History





NIETZSCHE'S MOST IMPORTANT PROPOSITION

OF HISTORICAL METHOD





A. N. Whitehead famously remarked (see previous citation on p. 57) that all later philosophy might well be described as a footnote to Plato. How often, indeed, must any decent scholar invent a formulation with pride in systematic analysis, and with hope for originality — only to discover that one of history's truly great thinkers had established the same principle, recognized its impor­tance, and even specified its full range of application. I described a case of this ultimately humbling experience (see p. 51), when I discovered that, for all the struggles of several macroevolutionists, none more intense than my own, to define a workable concept of species selection in the 1970's, Hugo de Vries had formulated the idea, and even applied the same name, in his 1905 book, written in English and therefore scarcely qualifying as light hidden under a bushel for anglophonic readers.

I knew that a claim for originality could never be asserted for my various writings on the key structural and historical principle of inherent differences between current utility and causes of origin, and on the consequent impossi­bility of inferring reasons for evolutionary construction only from current adaptive roles (Darwin, after all and as we shall see (pp. 1218–1224), in­voked this principle to disperse a theoretical objection that he regarded as the most potent challenge to the central logic of natural selection). I have written about this subject for more than 30 years, and with a growing attempt at systematization, moving from my naive, albeit accurate, distinction of “immedi­ate” and “retrospective” significance in Ontogeny and Phylogeny (1977b), to the spandrels of San Marco (Gould and Lewontin, 1979), to the codification of exaptation as a missing term in the science of form (Gould and Vrba, 1982). Only my work on punctuated equilibrium has attracted more citations, and I ventured to hope that I had, at least, presented a richer and more systematic analysis to demonstrate the centrality of this underappreciated principle, which operates so effectively as a bulwark for structuralist perspec­tives in evolutionary theory — thus setting the location of the topic within this book. (I wrote in 1982, epitomizing the meaning of this theme for the general subject of constraint as a structural channeler of adaptation (Gould and Vrba, 1982, p. 13): “Exaptive possibilities define the 'internal' contribution that or­ganisms make to their own evolutionary future.”)

Then, in 1998 and thanks to the broader vision of my (then) graduate stu­dent Margaret Yacobucci, I discovered that Friedrich Nietzsche had bril­liantly elucidated this principle, with its full spate of implications, in one of his most celebrated works, The Genealogy of Morals, first published in 1887.

Throughout his career, Nietzsche (1844-1900) struggled to identify and define the root motives behind our conventional beliefs about morality, phi­losophy and religion in Western traditions. He viewed these beliefs as second­ary and functional expressions of a primary, generating source: “the essence of life, its will to power” (1967 edition, p. 56). And he recognized that we would never understand the nature and character of this primary source if we only analyzed the current utility of its secondary manifestations.

Nietzsche has received a bum rap from history, and for reasons clearly be­yond his intention or control. In identifying traditional beliefs as secondary expressions of a will to power, he did not wish to deny their potency or their value, but only to make a proper logical separation so that their sources of or­igin, which we must also understand if we wish to achieve a full appreciation of their history and status, might be disentangled from their current utility. The later fascist misreading of Nietzsche did try to validate the worth, and to promote the pure expression, of a will to power on no basis beyond its mere existence — the very illogical step that Nietzsche analyzed so clearly in the work discussed in this section.

Nietzsche became mentally incapacitated in 1889, and lived the last years of his life under his sister's care. She later became an ardent Nazi, and used her control over Nietzsche's literary estate to further her own purposes, in­cluding the publication of notes that Nietzsche had discarded, and even some minor forgeries of her own. We owe Nietzsche far more respect and admira­tion than he receives from those who know him only for a common mis­understanding of his concept of the “Ubertnensch” or “superman” (not a Hitlerian defense of domination by the more powerful, but Nietzsche's ascetic description of a person who could accept complete repetition (“eternal recur­rence” in his terms) of life, with all its horrors, rather than wishing for an ed­ited version); and from those who may feel ambivalent towards Richard Strauss' tone poem on Also Sprach Zarathustra (Nietzsche's treatise on the tibermensch), the source for the stunning opening theme of Stanley Kubrick's film 2001, and a bit scary in its apparent glorying of a transcendence that might not always be kind to the majority left behind.

In the Genealogy of Morals, Nietzsche addresses the differences between historical origin and current utility in section 12 on the nature and meaning of punishment. He begins by outlining the various opinions of moral philoso­phers on the function or purpose of punishment in current society — “for ex­ample, revenge or deterrence” (p. 55), or more specifically (p. 57) “as a means of rendering harmless, of preventing further harm ... as payment of a debt to the creditor in any form (even one of emotional compensation)... as a means of isolating disturbance of balance.”

Nietzsche does not deny the force of these current utilities (and may well approve them as a matter of personal or public morality). Rather, he wants to resolve the different issue of the historical origin of punishment in human evolution (a quest highlighted in his book's title, The Genealogy of Morals). He recognizes that confusion between his question of historical origin and the unchallenged documentation of current utility poses the greatest barrier to­wards resolution. The opening sentences of this section outline the problem (p. 54): “Now another word on the origin and purpose of punishment — two problems which are separate, or ought to be: unfortunately people usually throw them together. How have the moral genealogists reacted so far in this matter? Naively, as is their wont: they highlight some 'purpose' in punish­ment, for example revenge or deterrence, then innocently place the purpose at the start, as causa fiendi [cause of making] of punishment — and have finished. But 'purpose of law' is the last thing we should apply to the history of the emergence of law.”

I would not, in this book, so highlight this crisp dissection of a key problem in evolutionary biology as well — the distinction between historical origin and current utility — if Nietzsche had not generalized the issue as central to all his­torical study, and if he had not so clearly explicated both the biological mean­ings, and the implications for adaptationist analysis as well.

Nietzsche labels the need to distinguish historical origin from current util­ity as “the major point of historical method” (p. 57). “There is no more im­portant proposition for all kinds of historical research” (p. 55), he adds, just before presenting his clearest statement of the general issue: “Namely, that the origin or the emergence of a thing and its ultimate usefulness, its practical application and incorporation into a system of ends, are toto coelo [entirely, or literally 'to the highest heavens'] separate; that anything in existence, having somehow come about, is continually interpreted anew, requisitioned anew, transformed and directed to a new purpose.”

To resolve his particular issue, Nietzsche needs to make this separation be­cause he wishes to locate the origin of punishment in the almost inevitable manifestation of a primal will to power. But if we make the mistake of equat­ing an admitted and efficacious modern utility (in deterrence or resolution of debt, for example) with the ground of origin as well, we will never under­stand the genealogy of morals. Again, and contrary to the common misunder­standing, Nietzsche does not wish to advocate historical origin as a source of validation. Quite to the contrary, he argues that we need to understand the reasons for origin in order to analyze the source and strength of the underly­ing motivation (whatever the current utility), thus giving us better insight into our actions and natures.

In a fascinating passage, Nietzsche then uses the biological example of eye and hand to assert his specific point about punishment, and to introduce a relative ranking, with the adaptation of current utility regarded as a second­ary imprint upon a more fundamental original source:

No matter how perfectly you have understood the usefulness of any physiological organ (or legal institution, social custom, political usage, art form or religious rite) you have not yet thereby grasped how it emerged: uncomfortable and unpleasant as this may sound ... for peo­ple down the ages have believed that the obvious purpose of a thing, its utility, form and shape are its reason for existence: the eye is made to see, the hand to grasp. So people think punishment has evolved for the pur­pose of punishing. But every purpose and use is just a sign that the will to power has achieved mastery over something less powerful.



Two other aspects of Nietzsche's extraordinary analysis show how com­pletely he had grasped this key principle of historical explanation with all its far-reaching implications, each of equal importance in evolutionary biology as well. First, he recognizes (as Darwin did) that the disengagement of current utility from historical origin establishes the ground of contingency and unpre­dictability in history — for if any organ, during its history, undergoes a series of quirky shifts in function, then we can neither predict the next use from a current value, nor can we easily work backwards to elucidate the reasons be­hind the origin of the trait. Note, in the following passage, how Nietzsche re­fers to the chain of secondary utilities as “adaptations”; how he specifies that the steps in the sequence of utilities follow each other “at random” (in Eble's (1999) sense of unrelated to, and unpredictable from, previous states and not in the strict mathematical sense); and how he clearly recognizes the sig­nificance of this principle for dispersing any hope that a phyletic history might be interpreted as a “progressus towards a goal,” another almost eerie similarity with Darwin's understanding of the meaning of contingency in evo­lution:

The whole history of a “thing”, an organ, a tradition can to this extent be a continuous chain of signs, continually revealing new interpreta­tions and adaptations, the causes of which need not be connected even amongst themselves, but rather sometimes just follow and replace one another at random. The “development” of a thing, a tradition, an organ is therefore certainly not its progressus towards a goal, still less is it a logical progressus, taking the shortest route with least expenditure of en­ergy and cost, — instead it is a succession of more or less profound, more or less mutually independent processes of subjugation exacted on the thing.



Second, Nietzsche promulgates an ordering of importance, with reasons for origin as primary in more than a merely temporal sense, and current utili­ties as sets of secondary “adaptations” (his description) with only transient status and less influence (than the persisting force behind the primal origin) upon any future state. I would not defend this ranking for an application to evolutionary theory, if only because Nietzsche's formative “will to power” identifies a persisting force that must influence any subsequent adaptation as well, whereas the original context of an evolved phenotypic feature need not exert such a continuing hold upon later history. But I do appreciate Nietz­sche's point, which can be translated into evolutionary terms as the source of constraint. The original reason does continue to exert a hold upon history through the structural constraints that channel later usages. Once feathers originate for thermoregulation, the form of any later utility for flight will be influenced by features built for the original context.

Nietzsche therefore criticizes those “genealogists” who mistake a current utility for a source of origin — for this erroneous argument “forces 'adapta­tion' into the foreground, which is a second-rate activity, just a reactivity ... This is to misunderstand the essence of life, its will to power. We overlook the prime importance which the spontaneous, aggressive, expansive, reinterpret­ing, redirecting and formative powers have, which 'adaptation' only follows when they have had their effect.”

Finally, Nietzsche reasserts the biological analog of the hand to reinforce his rankings and to reemphasize the importance of understanding historical origin, and of establishing criteria for separating origins from later utilities (in the face of difficulties outlined at the end of the quotation) in any truly histor­ical study:

The procedure itself will be something older, predating its use as punish­ment, that the latter was only inserted and interpreted into the procedure (which had existed for a long time though it was thought of in a different way), in short, that the matter is not to be understood in the way our naive moral and legal genealogists assumed up till now, who all thought the procedure had been invented for the purpose of punishment, just as people used to think that the hand had been invented for the purpose of grasping. With regard to the other element in punishment, the fluid one, its “meaning,” the concept “punishment” presents, at a very late stage of culture (for example, in Europe today), not just one meaning but a whole synthesis of “meanings”: the history of punishment up to now in gen­eral, the history of its use for a variety of purposes, finally crystallizes in a kind of unity which is difficult to dissolve back into its elements.





EXAPTATION AND THE PRINCIPLE OF QUIRKY FUNCTIONAL

SHIFT: THE RESTRICTED DARWINIAN VERSION AS THE GROUND

OF CONTINGENCY





How Darwin resolved Mivart’s challenge of incipient stages


Darwin treated this issue of discordance between historical origin and current utility in his catchall Chapter 6 entitled Difficulties on Theory. Although this chapter amalgamates a potpourri of objections, and we may therefore con­clude that Darwin regarded none of them as sufficiently central for separation as a full topic in its own right, he does grant special prominence to functional shift as a solution to a range of issues, including the overtly opposite pairing of “organs of extreme perfection” and “organs of small importance.” He even dignifies the principle with a rarity in his own prose conventions, an ad­jective of intensification: “In considering transitions of organs, it is so impor­tant to bear in mind the probability of conversion from one function to an­other” (1859, p. 191, my italics).

But Darwin only came to appreciate the centrality of this principle when the book that he considered most cogent as a general critique of natural selec­tion — St. George Mivart's On the Genesis of Species (1871) — led him to com­pose, for the 6th and final edition of the Origin of Species (1872), the only chapter ever added to his book, largely as a point by point refutation of Mivart's claims: the interpolated Chapter 7 entitled “Miscellaneous objec­tions to the theory of natural selection.” As a further observation on stylistic questions, I'm sure that Mivart's decision to name his own book with a par­ody on Darwin's title must have caught Darwin's special attention, and per­haps his ire. In calling his work On the Genesis of Species (rather than the Origin), Mivart needled Darwin with the common taunt of the times (see pp. 139-140): that natural selection could play a minor and negative role in eliminating the unfit, but that some other “positive” force must generate the fit. (I suspect that most of us would prefer to have our ideas rejected as dan­gerously wrong, but at least interesting and worthy of anathematization, rather than dismissed as correct, but trivial.)

Mivart expresses the thoroughness of his condemnation (speaking of him­self in the third person) with a common rhetorical strategy in Victorian sci­ence: claiming the ultimate fairness of an initially favorable impression, only dispelled and reversed by careful and objective consideration of a catalogue of empirical evidence. In this passage, Mivart asserts the “secondary and sub­ordinate” role of natural selection, while claiming that another “positive” mechanism, able to generate the fit (of his book's title), must be sought (1871, p. 225):

He was not originally disposed to reject Mr. Darwin's fascinating theory. Reiterate endeavours to solve its difficulties have, however, had the effect of convincing him that that theory as the one or as the leading explana­tion of the successive evolution and manifestation of specific forms is untenable. At the same time he admits fully that “Natural Selection” acts and must act, and that it plays in the organic world a certain though a secondary and subordinate part.

The one modus operandi yet suggested having been found insufficient, the question arises, Can another be substituted in its place? If not, can anything that is positive, and if anything, what, be said as to the question of specific origination?



St. George Mivart (1817-1900) became something of a tragic figure in Vic­torian biology. He devoted much of his career to reconciling biology and reli­gion in terms of his unconventional attitudes in each discipline — only to meet ultimate rejection by both camps. At age seventeen, he abandoned his Angli­can upbringing, became a Roman Catholic, and consequently (in a less toler­ant age of state religion) lost his opportunity for training in natural history at Oxford or Cambridge. He became a lawyer but managed to carve out a dis­tinguished career as an anatomist nonetheless. He embraced evolution and won firm support from the powerful T. H. Huxley, but his strongly expressed and idiosyncratic anti-Darwinian views incurred the wrath of Britain's bio­logical establishment. He tried to unite his biology with his religion in a series of books and essays, and ended up excommunicated for his trouble six weeks before his death.

The ever-perceptive Darwin had chosen well for his primary source of worry. In this book, Mivart presents a thorough and logically inclusive ac­count of structuralist evolutionary thought as a substitute for natural se­lection (complete with the usual linkage of channeling and saltation into a coherent primary critique). Mivart centered his attack upon an argument em­bodied in a phrase that still persists as virtually his only commonly recog­nized legacy to the history of evolutionary thought. He introduces this phrase as the title to his first substantive chapter (after some opening pages entitled “introduction”): “The incompetency of 'natural selection' to account for the incipient stages of useful structures.” (In my popular writing, I have referred to this critique as the “5 percent of a wing principle,” as expressed in the common layman's objection: “I can understand how wings work for flight once they originate, but how can evolution ever make a wing in Darwin's gradualist and adaptationist mode if five percent of a wing can't possibly pro­vide any benefit for flight?”)

Mivart constructs this chapter as a compendium of examples where, in his judgment, no putative value could be assigned to early incipient stages (lepidopteran mimicry, flight, the placement of both eyes on the upper side of flatfishes, etc.). He then concludes (1871, p. 61): “That minute, fortuitous, and indefinite variations could have brought about such special forms and modifications as have been enumerated in this chapter, seems to contradict not imagination, but reason.”

Mivart then attempts to resolve this problem in the most obvious man­ner — by the saltationist claim that intermediary stages never existed, and that novel adaptations may arise in single steps. Interestingly, and as mentioned in Chapter 5 (p. 344), Mivart invokes the compelling structuralist model and image of Galton's Polyhedron (see pp. 342–351) to illustrate this centerpiece of his system (pp. 97-98):

Arguments may yet be advanced in favor of the view that new species have from time to time manifested themselves with suddenness, and by modifications appearing at once (as great in degree as are those which separate Hipparion from Equus), the species remaining stable in the in­tervals of such modifications: by stable being meant that their variations only extend for a certain degree in various directions, like oscillations in a stable equilibrium. This is the conception of Mr. Galton, who compares the development of species with a many faceted spheroid tumbling over from one facet, or stable equilibrium, to another. The existence of internal conditions in animals corresponding with such facets is denied by pure Darwinians.



Mivart recognizes that any saltationist claim must resolve the two cardinal objections that lead many scientists to embrace the gradualism of Darwin and Lyell: (1) How, short of invoking something miraculous, can so many parts be altered together, and all at once, to produce a harmonious and adaptive result in a highly modified descendant; and (2) how can any theory of one-step transformation explain the parallel or convergent modification of sets of co­ordinated features, as found in many independent lineages?

Mivart faces these difficulties along the standard structuralist route, by calling upon the other concept so often twinned with claims for saltation: in­ternally channeled change. If alterations, like isotropic Darwinian mutations, could modify an organism in any direction, then the difficulties stated above would become insuperable. But if jumps can only occur along certain limited routes, set by the internal structure of organisms and predisposed towards harmonious alteration of coordinated parts, then saltations become both limited in directional expression, and biased towards workability. Again, Galton's Polyhedron suggests such a linkage of saltation (facet flipping) with internally limited directionality (restriction of routes of change to positions underlain by adjacent facets). Mivart states (1871, p. 143): “All these dif­ficulties are avoided if we admit that new forms of animal life of all degrees of complexity appear from time to time with comparative suddenness, being evolved according to laws in part depending on surrounding conditions, in part internal — similar to the way in which crystals (and, perhaps from recent researches, the lowest forms of life) build themselves up according to the in­ternal laws of their component substance, and in harmony and correspon­dence with all environing influences and conditions.”

But what operational good can emanate from an invocation of such inter­nal forces (even granting the logical soundness of the argument), if the nature of these forces remains unknown and mysterious, thus reducing their status to special pleading? Mivart even cites the classical literary spoof of such fool­ish arguments, as presented by the phony doctors of Moliere's hypochon­driac: “But it may be again objected that to say that species arise by the help of an innate power possessed by organisms is no explanation, but is a repro­duction of the absurdity, I'opium endormit parcequ'il a une vertu soporifique (p. 230)” (opium puts you to sleep because it possesses a soporific virtue).

In reply, Mivart points out that we also know nothing about the physical nature of Newtonian gravity, but still find the concept useful because such mathematical regularities as the inverse square law have explanatory, predic­tive and integrative power. Similarly, we may not know the actual workings of heredity, but we can, by empirical cataloguing and experimentation, deter­mine sets of observed regularities in the variations of modern species. Follow­ing the traditions of 19th century structuralism, Mivart recommends the study of natural “sports,” both the occasional large variants that can survive in nature, and the teratological malformations that may not be viable, but that illustrate the potential pathways of internally coordinated variation, fol­lowing recognizable channels of ontogeny, sexual variation, etc. “It is proba­ble therefore that new species may arise from some constitutional affection of parental forms — an affection mainly, if not exclusively, of their generative system” (p. 233).

In the added chapter to his 6th and final edition, Darwin refers to Mivart as “a distinguished zoologist,” and admits that he has presented all viable objec­tions to natural selection “with admirable art and force” (1872b, p. 164). He then summarizes Mivart's structuralist alternative, describing first the claim for channeling, and then the argument for saltation. He rejects both, primar­ily because they lack either a known mechanism or verified cases; Darwin then reasserts his belief in the efficacy of gradualistic natural selection, work­ing upon isotropic and undirected variation (pp. 187-188):

At the present day almost all naturalists admit evolution under some form. Mr. Mivart believes that species change through “an internal force or tendency,” about which it is not pretended that anything is known. That species have a capacity for change will be admitted by all evolution­ists; but there is no need, as it seems to me, to invoke any internal force beyond the tendency to ordinary variability, which through the aid of se­lection by man has given rise to many well-adapted domestic races, and which through the aid of natural selection would equally well give rise by graduated steps to natural races or species...

Mr. Mivart is rather inclined to believe, and some naturalists agree with him, that new species manifest themselves “with suddenness and by modifications appearing at once.” For instance, he supposed that the differences between the extinct three-toed Hipparion and the horse arose suddenly. He thinks it difficult to believe that the wing of a bird “was developed in any other way than by a comparatively sudden modification of a marked and important kind”; and apparently he would extend the same view to the wings of bats and pterodactyls. This conclusion, which implies great breaks or discontinuity in the series, appears to me improb­able in the highest degree.



Darwin acknowledges that Mivart's argument about incipient stages had been particularly troubling (p. 165): “The one new point which appears to have struck many readers is, 'natural selection is incompetent to account for the incipient stages of useful structures.' This subject is intimately connected with that of the gradation of characters, often accompanied by a change of function — for instance, the conversion of a swim-bladder into lungs.” Dar­win notes that he had dealt with this issue in his original Chapter 6 on “difficulties,” admits that he had not paid the subject sufficient heed, and praises Mivart for an opportunity to correct his previous slighting (p. 185): “A good opportunity has thus been afforded for enlarging a little on grada­tions of structure, often associated with changed functions, — an important subject, which was not treated at sufficient length in the former editions of this work.”

I will not describe Darwin's solutions to the problem of “incipient stages” at length, because I have already done so in Chapter 2, my exegesis of the Or­igin of Species. But I do need to emphasize the relevant point for this chap­ter — that both of his effective arguments against Mivart's supposed trump card invoke structural principles of constraint rooted in Nietzsche's “major point of historical method”: the discordance between historical origin and current function.

In his first argument, Darwin readily admits the “5 percent of a wing” problem, and then presents the incisive solution that becomes enshrined in evolutionary theory (by no fault of Darwin, who never used the term) under the most unfortunate name of “preadaptation.” Yes, five percent of a wing offers no conceivable aerodynamic benefit, and could not therefore either be formed, or converted into a full wing, under a smooth regime of natural selec­tion for flight. But sequences forged by selection only presuppose continu­ity in differential reproductive success, not continuity in a single function. Thus, the incipient stages may have performed a different function, for which their 5 percent of a wing imparted benefits. Eventually, the enlarging proto-wing entered the domain of aerodynamic benefit, and the original function changed to the primary utility now exploited by most birds. Current function cannot be equated with reasons for historical origin. Mivart's cardinal objec­tion disappears, thus explaining why “it is so important to bear in mind the probability of conversion from one function to another.”

Darwin roots his second argument in the related, but even more general­ized, structural principle of redundancy — the inherent capacity (based on in­trinsic structure rather than current function) of most organs to work in more than one way (either at the same time, providing dual benefits, or with one utility overtly exploited by natural selection, and the other latent, providing unselected flexibility for future change). Darwin presents this argument in a fascinating manner by coupling two apparently opposite facts about redun­dancy: that a single function can be performed by more than one organ, and that a single organ can perform more than one function. Thus, an organ need not invent an entirely new function in some mysterious manner, but may evolve by intensifying a previously minor use, or even by recruiting an inher­ent but unexpressed potential. Meanwhile, the modified organ can abandon its previous major function because other organs can continue (or intensify) their former operation in the service of the same necessary task.

Thus, reptilian jawbones can become mammalian ear bones because they already played some role in sound transmission while they functioned pri­marily to articulate the jaw of therapsid forebears (the principle of two func­tions for one structure). They then become free to move into the middle ear because the transitional forms (as demonstrated empirically by such fossils as Diarthrognathus, and not only as a reasonable conjecture) possessed a dou­ble jaw joint (the reciprocal principle of two structures for one function) — and the bones of the old quadrate-articular joint could then become the malleus and incus of the ear because the new dentarysquamosal joint was al­ready “up and running,” thus avoiding the specter of an inconceivable inter­mediate with an unhinged jaw.

Interestingly, Darwin's own favorite example for coupling these two princi­ples of redundancy, repeated many times in the Origin of Species and still res­ident in most biology textbooks today, is not only wrong, but backwards. He invoked this coupling to explain the supposed conversion of piscine air blad­ders into lungs. But the same argument works just as well, in reverse order, for the actual transformation of lungs in plesiomorphic fishes to swim blad­ders in highly derived teleosts that did not originate until the Triassic (Liem, 1988). Darwin wrote (1859, pp. 204-205): “A swim-bladder has apparently been converted into an air-breathing lung. The same organ having performed simultaneously very different functions, and then having been specialized for one function; and two very distinct organs having performed at the same time the same function, the one having been perfected whilst aided by the other, must often have largely facilitated transitions.” (Ancestral fish lungs can in­deed also function for buoyancy, whereas, and more obviously, gills work as well as lungs for breathing. Modern lungfishes retain both systems, as their formal name, Dipnoi (or “two breathing”) testifies.)





The two great historical and structural implications of quirky

functional shift


This principle of functional shift deserves far more prominence, and explicit recognition, than it has ever received among evolutionary theorists. I have tried to emphasize its vital role in establishing the contingency and unpre­dictability of evolutionary change by an adjectival strategy of designation as “quirky functional shift.” In operational terms, we should acknowledge, most of all, the property of major functional alteration based upon far more limited (in extreme cases, virtually absent) structural change — another way of expressing the structuralist concept of inherent flexibility in natural forms and designs (to different degrees that should be subject to specification on a case by case basis). In any event, however textually underemphasized, this principle has always played two important roles in standard Darwinian theory:

AS THE GROUND OF CONTINGENCY FOR LIFE'S HISTORY. Thoughtful Darwinians, no matter how confidently they have identified natural selec­tion as the exclusive cause of evolutionary change, have always recognized that their theory necessarily underpredicts the actual pathways of life's his­tory — and that explanations for the byways of individual lineages (and major aspects of the highways as well) can only be located in the factual record of particulars. This concept potentiated the tacit truce that, until recent years, held between paleontologists and Darwinian theorists under the Modern Synthesis. Under accepted terms, the theorists said to the paleontologists: “give up your old claims about special macroevolutionary mechanisms, and admit our contention that microevolutionary population genetics and natural selection hold full theoretical sufficiency. We will then grant you control over the actual pageant of life's history by allowing that no nomothetic theory (and ours is 'as good as it gets') can specify actual pathways without factoring in the historical particulars that only your record preserves.” (I have scarcely hid my conviction, either in this book or elsewhere, that this truce always op­erated as a “lousy deal” for the science of paleontology.)

In a minimal sense, Darwinian theory must grant this space to contin­gency — if only because even the most basic and least sophisticated form of the theory holds that organisms adapt to changing local environments (and do not follow preestablished routes towards “progress” or any other goal). Since we all admit that local environments change on an erratic and contin­gent vector through time, life's overall pathway must be dominated by contin­gent factors, even if every immediate event of natural selection could, in prin­ciple, achieve a deterministic explanation in local environmental terms. (After all, this feature of Darwinism as emphasized in Chapter 2, and as long appre­ciated by intellectual historians, established the most radical aspect of natural selection from the start — as contrary to all earlier evolutionary speculations, with their assumptions about law like directionality, usually regulated by di­vine intent.)

But if contingency resided only in this basic aspect of environmental scal­ing, then the principle, though sound enough, would not run so deep in Dar­winian traditions. Rather, contingency gains its greatest force through the principle of quirky functional shift: the discordance between historical origin and current utility, and the consequent fallacy of direct inference from mod­ern status to initial meaning. Nietzsche emphasized the primary role of this discordance in the study of history by writing (as quoted more fully on p. 1217) that “the development of a thing, a tradition, an organ is therefore certainly not its progressus towards a goal,” and that the inevitability of func­tional shift makes any important historical sequence “instead ... a succession of more or less profound, more or less mutually independent processes of subjugation exacted on the thing.”

Even a unidirectional sequence of changing form with basically unaltered function would require explicit knowledge of contingent environmental his­tories for anything close to full or satisfactory explanation. The addition of quirky functional shift, usually in several episodes for each organ in any complex phylogeny, guarantees a cardinal role for historical explanation in any major lineage (again, as Nietzsche recognized). In a personally favorite example, for combining the canonical general case with a particular ending twist, the African black heron, Egretta ardesiaca, uses its wings largely to shade the shallow water of its habitat, thus providing a clear view of available prey (my thanks to E. Vrba for this example, as discussed in Gould and Vrba, 1982).

Any intelligent person with a sense of history's length and meaning could identify the author of the following statement as a modern Parsifal, or perfect fool: “Aha, now I know why herons evolved wings — in order to eat, for they would starve if they couldn't shade the water and see their food.” Our savvy interlocutor would offer the obvious refutation that most birds use their wings to fly (as does the egret, albeit as a “demoted” secondary utility in the species' current habitat). Any knowledgeable biologist would then add — hence my fondness for this example of double quirky functional shift — that feathers were initially coopted for flight in a much older functional shift, a de­fining transition in avian phylogeny from a different initial role, perhaps in thermoregulation. This old hypothetical argument has now been fortified by two sources of evidence: experimental data on the thermodynamic, with no accompanying aerodynamic, advantages of tiny protowings (Kingsolver and Koehl, 1985); and historical data on the probable origin of birds from the smallest-bodied lineage of running dinosaurs, a group that might have experi­enced the greatest functional need for supplementary thermoregulation, given their highest levels of activity combined with highest surface/volume ratios (as a consequence of minimal body size), of any lineage within the dinosaurian clade. Indeed, this example has served as the canonical illustration, ever since Mivart's defining book of 1871, for “the problem of incipient stages of useful structures,” or quirky functional shift (and also as the eponym for my designation, in nontechnical writing, as “the 5 percent of a wing problem”).

Faced with this argument, our Parsifal might continue to reject contin­gency, and embrace predictability, on the false assumption that natural knowledge, as “scientific,” must be so constituted. Even after we mock his previous conviction that he knows why egrets developed wings when he un­derstands their present use, we discover that he has not generalized the mes­sage, for he now argues from the opposite temporal end: “But if I, as a great scientist with full knowledge of evolutionary theory, had visited the Earth in early Jurassic times and observed the avian ancestor as a small running dino­saur using feathers on protowings for supplementary thermoregulation, I surely could have concluded that this animal would evolve larger wings and eventually enter a realm of cooptable utility for flight. I would also know that, for 150 million years, the ancestors of African herons would use those wings for flight, and then, on a continent to be called Africa [for our seer also knows the future history of plate tectonics on Earth] this one little avian lin­eage would redeploy those old thermoregulatory organs for yet another novel task of shading water.” At this point, and continuing the literary analogy, we could only hope that our Parsifal finds the Holy Grail of quirky functional shift, and abandons his foolish ways for the path of wisdom!

Needless to say, the actual history of any key organ in any major lineage far surpasses this avian cartoon both in complexity and in number of episodes of functional shifting. Just consider, for starters, the passage from a cartillaginous rod-like element, functioning to support the agnathan gill, to the hyomandibula of gnathostome fishes (used primarily to suspend the upper jaw from the cranium), to the stapes of tetrapods (following fusion of the up­per jaw to the skull, and responding to a functional need for a different mode of sound perception in air vs. water).

This quirky historical character of major evolutionary change in particular lineages — thoroughly explainable after the fact, however unpredictable in principle beforehand — constitutes the greatest fascination of the subject for many practitioners, myself included. Yet, this same inherent historicity has saddened scientists of other temperaments and predilections. For people who find greatest satisfaction in those aspects of nature that achieve full meaning and explanation under invariant and timeless laws, but who cannot resist the fascination of evolutionary biology as a career, the irreducibly contingent as­pect of their chosen subject defines its least congenial attribute. Such scientists have therefore tended to underplay (or even, in extreme cases, largely to deny) contingency, or to focus on those broader aspects of the subject, far from the fascination of the toings and froings of real history in concrete lin­eages, that do fall into the more conventional realm of predictability under natural law. Indeed, the previous section of this chapter treated this species of structuralist thought — and though I did not hide my own lack of affinity for this approach, I trust that I did grant the subject my genuine respect and ac­knowledgment of partial validity (while also expressing my abiding admira­tion for the sheer iconoclasm and beautiful prose of D'Arcy Thompson). I may be a historian at heart, but I do understand Kauffman's frustration, and his point, when he recognizes the intellectual linkage of natural selection to contingency, and then writes (1993, p. 26):

We have come to think of selection as essentially the only source of order in the biological world. ... It follows that, in our current view, organ­isms are largely ad hoc solutions to design problems cobbled together by selection. It follows that most properties, which are widespread in or­ganisms, are widespread by virtue of common descent from a tinkered-together ancestor, with selective maintenance of the useful tinkerings. It follows that we see organisms as overwhelmingly contingent historical accidents, abetted by design . . .

My own aim is not so much to challenge as to broaden the neo-Darwinian tradition. For, despite its resilience, that tradition has surely grown without seriously attempting to integrate the ways in which sim­ple and complex systems may spontaneously exhibit order.



As ONE OF THE TWO MAJOR SOURCES OF STRUCTURALIST INPUT INTO THE PRIMARILY FUNCTIONALIST BASIS OF DARWINIAN THE­ORY. I treated Darwin's primary acknowledgment of a subsidiary role for structuralist, and at least partly non-adaptationist, thinking within the the­ory of natural selection — his treatment of “correlations of growth,” or nonadaptative side-consequences of adaptive change — in Chapter 4, pages 330–341. Darwin's discussion of quirky functional shift, and his recognition of this principle's indispensability for including the evolution of major novelties within the compass of natural selection by gradual change, marks his second substantial foray into subsidiary themes of a primarily formalist or structuralist character — in modern terms, his acknowledgment of an important role for internal constraint (as a precondition and helpmeet for natural selec­tion) in directing the history of evolutionary lineages.

The role played by historical constraint in quirky functional shift lies im­plicit within the previous discussion of contingency, and therefore needs little additional elaboration. Suffice to say that if a capacity for utilization in mark­edly different ways did not lie within the inherent or formal structure of most primary adaptations, then evolution would never be able to reach a novel “there” from its present “here” — and life's history would stagnate in tran­sient perfection (and then expire when surrounding environments underwent their occasional substantial alterations).

After all, natural selection cannot act as a magic wand for the immediate construction of any urgent need. The adaptability — or, in the more general term now finally receiving substantial and deserved attention from organismal biologists (see p. 1270), the “evolvability” — of any phenotype must de­pend, in large part, on a flexibility for future change that simply cannot arise, if we understand the nature of causality itself aright, by direct natural selec­tion at the usual Darwinian level of organismal phenotypes. Therefore, a large component of evolvability must be attributed to inherent structural properties of features that originated by natural selection for one reason, but also manifest a capacity for subsequent recruitment (with minimal change) to substantially different and novel functions. The study and systematization of these formal and structural reasons for evolvability sets an important agenda, now largely unfulfilled but attracting considerable interest, for evolutionary biology.

To return to my previous example, the agnathan ancestor that built a series of v-shaped, backward-pointing gill arches, each made of several rod-like ele­ments, for pumping water to breathe and feed, evolved these features for its own immediate needs, and not (obviously) with any forethought about modifiability into jaws that might one day surround its unsupported mouth. But if the elements of the foremost arch had not inherently possessed the form, the positioning, the coordination, and the developmental potential to move to a more anterior position surrounding the mouth, the gnathostome lineage would never have emerged, the agnathans might have remained a relatively minor component of marine faunas (or become extinct entirely), and terres­trial environments, to this day, might have remained the domain of plants and insects — perfectly competent and “happy” ecosystems, building a lovely earth teeming with life, but evolving nothing conscious to proclaim its aes­thetic, extol its virtues, or to record, perhaps even to seal, its doom. We must thank both this contingent good fortune, and the latent structural possibili­ties of gill arches, for this shot at our own particular brand of record keeping (even of “immortality” in some operationally meaningful sense of the term).

The story, of course, continues from there (and for each lineage), with a constant twinning of contingency and structural potentiality. If one marginal group of fishes had not evolved a peculiar fin, with a branching central ele­ment orthogonal to the body's antero-posterior axis (rather than parallel to the axis, as in most self-respecting members of the clade and guild), no sup­port firm enough to build the centerpiece of a limb for terrestrial life might ever have emerged within the lineage of vertebrates. And if these resulting tetrapods had never evolved their forelimb for terrestrial locomotion, the cel­ebrated convergence of aerodynamic form in the wings of bats, birds and pterosaurs — the supposed disproof of contingency's dominant role in evolu­tion! — would have died aborning for want of a common and contingent sub­strate on which to hang these adaptive marvels of similarly excellent design.

In wondering why this principle of quirky functional shift, or the discor­dance between reasons for origin and current utility, has received such short shrift in Darwinian traditions, despite its pivotal importance for these two central aspects of natural selection, I can only conclude that its status has, heretofore, rested only upon its acknowledged capacity for auxiliary aid, and not upon a claim for conceptual novelty thus supplied to evolutionary theory. Such an evaluation flows easily from an understanding that quirky functional shift, when confined to this Darwinian formulation, remains entirely within the ordinary functionalist and adaptationist framework of the general theory. That is, Darwin's version of the principle, overly restrictive as I shall show in the next subsection, remains fully adaptational in confining its compass to functional shift from one utility to another. The feature in question initially evolves as a conventional adaptation for one function, and then becomes co-opted for a different role. This shift may validate the centrality of contingency for a Darwinian explanation of history, but the process remains under adap­tational direction at all times — and the fundamental mechanism of Darwin­ian evolutionary change never cedes any control. In other words, features that undergo this Darwinian style of quirky shift retain full functionality throughout, and their changes remain under the government of natural selec­tion at all times. Thus, the analysis of history may be enriched, but the mech­anisms of evolution do not alter or augment.

Nonetheless, although I may recognize why Darwinian tradition has underemphasized quirky functional shift, I still believe that this inattention has created substantial problems in our understanding of the logic of evolution­ary change. (As a psychological inference, I also suspect that this neglect flows from the status of quirky functional shift as a slightly uncomfortable “odd man out,” exuding a structuralist odor within an apparatus deemed powerful and intellectually intriguing for its functionalist basis and mechan­ics — just as Darwin's other structuralist principle of “correlations of growth” has received similarly little regard in the history of our field, at least until evo-devo made constraint an operational concept, thus inspiring both our interest and attention.)





How exaptation completes and rationalizes the terminology of

evolutionary change by functional shifting


Following my idiosyncratic interest in the use of language as an under­appreciated guide to the history and relative ranking of concepts, I wish to cite a gaping hole in the logical terminology of Darwinian evolution as pri­mary evidence for this long, and regrettable, undervaluation of quirky func­tional shift. (This section follows the argument of Gould and Vrba, 1982.)

As a staple of anglophonic biology, long predating Darwin's explanatory spin, and extending back to Paley at the dawn of the 19th century, and to Boyle in the heart of the scientific revolution of the late 17th century, the process of crafting (usually construed as God's creating) a feature for a particular utility has been called “adaptation” — following the etymology of fashioning for (ad) a use (aptus). No problem so far; only an apt choice of terminology. But if “adaptation” denotes the process of crafting or creating for a use, what shall we call the resulting structure so used. We usually call the structure an “adaptation” as well — again no intrinsic problem, for we often use the same noun for a process and its results (“construction,” “building,” etc. to cite some analogs in the same architectural domain).

But problems may arise in historical systems if the current utility of an adaptation (the noun used for the result) did not arise by the process (also called adaptation) that built the result at its initial appearance — for, under the Nietzsche-Darwin principle of quirky functional shift, the form of the current adaptation (feature) may have arisen by adaptation (process) for a very dif­ferent role. (Similarly, the building on my corner now serves as a shelter and soup kitchen for homeless people — a utility not directly related to the pur­pose of its initial building as a church. We may not become confused in this case because we know the short history of this site, and the current use does not stray far from the stated ideals of the broader institution that originally raised the structure. But we could make some serious errors if we maintained a strong interest in long histories with spotty records featuring multiple epi­sodes of functional shifting, and then assumed that the use of a current build­ing automatically revealed the intention of its original building. When we recognized and generalized the error in such reasoning, we might even want to make a terminological distinction between our name for the current object and our name for the process of its original construction.)

In fact, I am not inventing an abstract or overfine distinction here. This very problem has been directly, even urgently, addressed in some of the most widely read and respected writings in evolutionary biology. When Williams (1966) composed his classic defense and explication of adaptation, he wisely identified adaptation as an “onerous” concept, to be invoked only when truly necessary, and restricted to a clear domain of unambiguous definition and use. He recommended, in particular, that the term be applied to a current fea­ture only when we can “attribute the origin and perfection of this design to a long period of selection for effectiveness in this particular role” (1966, p. 6). He even advocated a terminological distinction between the use of such a genuine adaptation (its “function”) and the use, potentially just as crucial to an organism's survival, of a feature not crafted by selection for its current role (and therefore not an adaptation in Williams's restricted terminology). Wil­liams suggested that we call this second form of fortuitous utility an “ef­fect” — giving as an incisive, if somewhat facetious, example the propensity of flying fishes to fall back into the water as an effect (not the function) of the organism's mass. In other words, Williams invoked the term “effect” to desig­nate the operation of a useful character not built by selection for its current role.

Although Darwin never formalized the issue, he clearly intended to restrict “adaptation” to Williams's sense of structures built by selection for their current utility — for he explicitly denies that an “indispensable” feature of mam­malian development should be called an adaptation (1859, p. 197): “The su­tures in the skulls of young mammals have been advanced as a beautiful adaptation for aiding parturition, and no doubt they facilitate, or may be in­dispensable for this act; but as sutures occur in the skulls of young birds and reptiles, which have only to escape from a broken egg, we may infer that this structure has arisen from the laws of growth, and has been taken advantage of in the parturition of the higher animals.”

But if we follow, as I believe we should, this restrictive clarification advo­cated by Darwin and Williams, what shall we call a feature that initially arose for a reason different from the selective basis of its current operation — even though this present utility may be as crucial to the organism's adaptive suc­cess as the function of any organ built directly by selection for its current role? Indeed, and curiously, the lexicon of evolutionary biology, until re­cently, included no name for a feature that now contributes to an organism's fitness in natural selection, but that arose for a different reason — the very kind of outcome whose explication had been recognized by Nietzsche as “the major point of historical method.” In other words, we cannot claim that the previous absence of such a term merely recorded the irrelevancy or peripheral status of the concept.

Evolutionary biology has long recognized a name for a related aspect of this phenomenon — but I cannot think of a more infelicitous term in our entire lexicon, explicitly so lamented and identified by scores of biologists. Because we have acknowledged the principle of quirky functional shift, if only for Darwin's own need in refuting Mivart's critique, we have felt some pressure to recognize a term for the potential utilities inherent in original uses. What should we call a feather's potential for flight while it still resides on the fore­arm of a small running dinosaur, functioning only for thermoregulation? Evolutionary biology has generally referred to such latent potentials as “pre-adaptations.”*

For two reasons, “preadaptation” cannot fulfill our need for a term to des­ignate features that arose for reasons different from their current utility.

1. Preadaptation can only describe a potential future utility of a feature op­erating in a different manner in an ancestor. The thermoregulating feather may be called a preadaptation for flight. But when birds then coopt feathers as essential components of an airborne wing, we surely cannot continue to call them preadaptations for their current utility! I simply refuse to be called a “wannabe scientist” (or even a “promising scientist”) because I once had a dream, and even (in retrospect) some inherent capacity for its realization, as a kid on the streets of New York.

2. What term in all our lexicon has ever come to us so inherently “prepack­aged” for inevitable trouble and misunderstanding? The motivation behind the name may be clear and fair enough — the desire to recognize a different potential in a current actuality. But in our real world, where we so often allow our hopes for intrinsic meaning to obscure the realities of a natural order — random and senseless in human terms, and replete with “bad things happen­ing to good people” — we guarantee ourselves nothing but trouble when we invent a word with a “plain meaning” of foreordination as a description and definition of our best examples to illustrate the precisely opposite concepts of fortuity and contingency. The resulting, entirely predictable, confusions be­came legion in biology classrooms, and professors developed a tradition for explicating and apologizing in advance whenever they mentioned “preadap­tation.” Terms that automatically evoke such embarrassment must be fatally flawed and fit only for the favored anathematization of my childhood years: “good riddance to bad garbage.”

I could present a catalog of such textbook apologies, but will cite only Frazzetta's lament (1975, p. 212) to prove that my fulminations at least can­not be called idiosyncratic: “The association between the word 'preadap­tation' and dubious teleology still lingers, and I can often produce a wave of nausea in some evolutionary biologists when I use the word unless I am quick to say what I mean by it.”

To rectify this odd situation of a missing term at the center of a key subject in evolutionary biology, Vrba and I proposed that features coopted for a cur­rent utility following an origin for a different function (or for no function at all) be called exaptations — that is, useful (or aptus) as a consequence of (ex) their form — in contrast with adaptations, or features directly crafted for their current utility. Adaptations have functions, and exaptations, following Williams's recommendation, have effects. We summarize our recommendations in Table 11-1 (from Gould and Vrba, 1982).

This coinage completes a logical structure that has been recognized ever since Darwin (and made explicit ever since Nietzsche) but that never included a term for one of the central rooms in the edifice. (My reasoning may be both simplistic and self-serving, but I can imagine only one explanation for such a curious situation: following Darwinian traditions, and especially under the orthodoxy of the “hardened” version of the Modern Synthesis, biologists be­came so accustomed to regarding all evolutionary change as adaptation di­rected by natural selection that they lost sight of the importance, or even the existence, of an undeniable corollary — that many (indeed most) features, as a

consequence of quirky functional shift, do not reveal their original evolution­ary context in their current utility. If all phenotypic traits are adaptive, and built by adaptation, why bother to make a formal distinction between fea­tures crafted, and features merely coopted, for their current utility?

But our renewed respect and attention to structuralist themes now makes such a formal distinction essential. Thus, Vrba and I recommended that fea­tures crafted for current use continue to be called adaptations (adopting the restriction advocated by Darwin and Williams), and that features coopted for current use, following an origin for some other reason, be called exaptations. We would also prefer that biologists embrace “aptation” rather than “adaptation” as the general descriptive term for a character now contrib­uting to fitness, with exaptation and adaptation defined as the two sub-categories of aptation, thus designated to recognize the crucial distinction between cooptation and direct shaping in the historical construction of char­acters.

This simple terminological strategy addresses the fair criticism that we can often only know the current basis of fitness — when we do not have enough evidence to determine whether a character developed as an exaptation or ad­aptation. In such cases, under our scheme, we refer to the character as an “aptation” and leave the further specification of its origin unaddressed. (Our current terminological conventions operate in this manner after all, for I may call a character an adaptation whether I accept Paley's belief in divine cre­ation or Darwin's mechanism of origin by natural selection. Both authors did, indeed, call useful structures “adaptations.”)

In an ideal world (and if I held the powers of a czar, which would, of course, then make such a world unideal ipso facto) I would fight for the full scheme, and campaign to replace “adaptation” with “aptation” as a base-level description (with no implication about mode of origin) for features now contributing to fitness. But I know the odds against unseating centuries of us­age for a word that not only serves as a staple of vernacular speech, but also enjoys unparalleled professional salience as a standard-bearer for our pre­ferred evolutionary theory. I don't play the lottery, and I don't understand the recreational appeal of skydiving or bungee jumping. So I will mortify my de­sires and learn to live with the traditionally broad use, thus facine with stoicism all the attendant confusion between “adaptation” as a general “state term” for useful features (whatever their mode of origin), and “adaptation” as a more restricted “process term” for the subset of aptive features that arose in the context of their current utility. However, a few people do win lotteries and survive horrendous falls, so I will not surrender entirely. Dum spiro, spero.

On the other hand, and to paraphrase Mr. Huxley in a famous context, I am prepared to go to the stake for exaptation — for this new term stands in important contrast with adaptation, defining a distinction at the heart of evo­lutionary theory, and also plugging an embarrassing hole in our previous lexi­con for basic processes in the history of life.





Key criteria and examples of exaptation


I cannot present a “review article” of empirical cases of exaptation, for the defining notion of quirky functional shift might almost be equated with evo­lutionary change itself, or at least with the broad and venerable subject of, in textbook parlance, “the origin of evolutionary novelties.” I will therefore fo­cus on the fate and utility of “exaptation” as a term for describing the evolu­tionary result of functional cooptation from a different source of origin. Our term (first defined in Gould and Vrba, 1982, p. 4) has not swept the field, as I might have hoped in my arrogant or naive mode, but “exaptation” has cer­tainly attracted a good share of attention and fruitful use — and may therefore be designated as adaptive for its original “intent.”

Above all, biologists have subjected the term to intense criticism and scru­tiny (see, for example, Coddington, 1988, and Buss et al., 1998), from which “exaptation” has emerged with strength and proven utility. In my opinion (partisan, of course), Arnold (1994) has presented the best single illustration of exaptation's importance as a concept and its operationality as a tool of re­search. He begins by recognizing the need to distinguish exaptation from ad­aptation as subcategories of the more general phenomenon of “aptation” (for he accepts and utilizes our suggested name for the encompassing concept as well). He also emphasizes the crucial methodological point, as previously dis­cussed for the comparable case of the invisibility of stasis under conventional definitions of evolution (Chapter 9), that exaptation must be explicitly de­fined within a revised theoretical framework, and cannot simply be “discov­ered” by researchers working within the paradigm of the hardened Modern Synthesis — because anything that “works” will be called an “adaptation” in the conventional theory, and will therefore be scrutinized no further for its potentially exaptive status (Arnold, 1994, p. 128): “One of the main reasons for trying to recognize exaptations is precisely because they are so easily mis­taken for adaptations. If the two kinds of aptation are not differentiated, we risk the possibility of exaggerating the undoubted importance of adaptation in fitting organisms to their environments and of ignoring a phenomenon which, like advantageous mutation, is one of the main sources of beneficial accident in the evolutionary process.”

Arnold then turns to the operational utility of exantation, first refurinp the arguments of those who found the concept intelligible, even interesting, but doubted that sufficient information could generally be obtained about the history of evidently functional features to make a proper distinction based upon inferences about prior states. Arnold argues that several advances, par­ticularly the codification of cladistic techniques for phyletic ordering, have made the distinction operational in a sufficiently high percentage of cases: the formerly broad definition of “adaptation for all useful traits whatever their origin was reasonable at a time when it was difficult to find out how advanta­geous traits had arisen, unless this had been observed in recent populations. However, phylogeny reconstruction now allows many individual exaptations to be recognized with some certainty, and makes distinction of exaptive and adaptive origin of performance advantage appropriate” (p. 126).

The relative timings for the origin of a form and for the inception of its cur­rent function — as inferred either from the branching points of a cladistic analysis, or from direct knowledge of historical sequences — provide the main criteria for distinction of exaptation from adaptation. “For adaptation,” Ar­nold writes (p. 132), “a hypothesis is refuted if the new trait develops before the relevant selective regime. If the test is passed, it is possible to check whether the new trait really confers an advantage in the new regime that its plesiomorphic state does not.”

Arnold then asks how we should interpret the opposite phenomenon “in which a derived trait and a regime in which it gives a performance advantage first appear concurrently on the same node on a lineage” (p. 133). This situa­tion of coincidence in cladogeny between form and function would seem to point to adaptation, but Arnold notes (p. 133) that an imperfect record must fail to provide evidence for several (probably most) events of speciation, and that traits may arise before selective regimes at these missing nodes, and then be compressed into coincidence with a current selective basis at the first re­corded node of their joint occurrence. I accept this point as evidently valid, but favorable for tests of the importance of exaptation. As emphasized in other contexts within this book, ineradicable biases in testing a hypothesis present little problem, and may even constitute a blessing in disguise, when their direction works against the hypothesis under test — because the hypothe­sis gains stronger affirmation by success in the face of such unfavorable odds. Since missing nodes must, by Arnold's argument, induce an underestimate for the frequency of exaptations by redirecting some genuine cases into the oppo­site category of adaptations (sensu stricto), this bias does not pose problems for tests of exaptation. For example, and using these twinned criteria, Arnold found 70 percent of 61 apomorphies in the lacertid lizard genus Meroles to be “concurrent with occupation of the environmental situation” (p. 133) of their present function — therefore requiring that they be ranked as adapta­tions.

Cases of multiple utility for a single feature offer special promise for resolu­tion by these criteria of temporal or cladogenetic sequencing. Arnold cites the case of “the aberrant arboreal tropical African lacertid lizard, Holaspis guentheri,” whose extremely flattened head “allows it to hunt and hide in narrow crevices beneath bark, and also constitutes an aerofoil which enables it to glide from tree to tree. Phylogenetic analysis shows that the flattening first developed in the context of crevice use and was only later coopted to gliding” (p. 139).

Moreover, such primary adaptations as head flattening for penetration of crevices usually work in synergy with other coopted features that operate as exaptations in the complex and multifaceted “fit” of the organism to its new environment. For example, when lizard heads become flattened, “the eyes do not usually become correspondingly smaller and, in normal activity, bulge upwards above the skull surface” (p. 139). Arnold then continues to describe the remarkable exaptation of a mouthful of eye: “However, when a lizard flees into a narrow crevice the eyes must be accommodated within the depth of the flattened head. They are most usually pushed downwards by the ceiling of the crevice as the lizard moves deeper into it, so their upper margins are flush with the skull roof and their lower sections bulge through the palate into the buccal cavity (p. 139).” In scincids and lacertids, the eye bulges verti­cally downward into the suborbital foramen. This aptation depends upon the preexistence of this opening (obviously evolved for other reasons), as indicated by its general distribution on the cladogram of lizards. Therefore, “as the occurrence of the foramen on the phylogeny of the forms concerned pre­cedes occupation of crevices, its use for accommodating the eye within the re­duced depth of the skull is an exaptation” (p. 139).

A common, but unfounded, objection to exaptation enters the logical structure of argument at this point. Several colleagues (Coddington, 1988, for example) have claimed that since almost any exapted structure will un­dergo secondary modification for its new role, and since these subsequent changes must count as adaptations, the concept of exaptation becomes either useless or confusing because any primarily exapted structure must then ac­crete secondary adaptations to be fully “fit” for its new role. I raise this issue here because, as Arnold points out, the suborbital “foramen is initially small and triangular, allowing only limited projection of the eye into the buccal cav­ity” (p. 139). This hole then undergoes a secondary adaptive enlargement to accommodate the eye more completely.

I am confident that this common objection cannot be sustained, because hierarchical sequences of processes, each with a different name and status, practically define the nature of complex historical change, and pose no con­ceptual problems (but rather help us to understand and sort out these se­quences), provided that we can specify the order of temporal precedence and hierarchical nesting. Exactly the same issue arises for homology and conver­gence, and for plesiomorphy and apomorphy. The front appendages of bats and birds are homologous as forearms and convergent as wings; live birth is plesiomorphic for the clade of marsupial and placental mammals, and apomorphic for the same clade within the Tetrapoda. Similarly, the suborbital fo­ramen of lizards is exaptive as a preexisting receptacle for the pushed-down eyes of lizards with flat heads, whereas the subsequent enlargement of the hole may be adaptive for better accommodation of the eyes. The two aspects can easily be separated, and their named distinction helps us to understand the probable sequence of evolutionary events. As Arnold states (p. 139): “there is subsequent, presumably adaptive, modification improving the initial exaptation, the foramen becoming larger and more rounded.”

Interestingly, and as further confirmation of the primarily exaptive nature of these vacuities, crevice-dwelling cordylid lizards, representing another sep­arate evolutionary entrance into this habitat, shift their eyes medially into the interpterygoid vacuity, rather than downward into the suborbital foramen. Arnold argues (see Figure 11-7 on these dual routes to exaptation in crevice-dwelling lizards) that cordylids may have utilized this alternative strategy be­cause this group happens to possess a large interpterygoid space (as lacertids and scincids do not) that can accommodate the eye without the secondary modification required to “house” eyes in the suborbital space. Of this side­wards exaptation of cordylids, Arnold writes (p. 140): “This again turns out to be an exaptation, for examination of the phylogeny of cordylids shows that expansion of the interpterygoid vacuity evolves before crevice use, al­though after the origin of the suborbital foramen. The vacuity may have been utilized instead of the foramen because, being large, it provided immedi­ate housing for a large portion of the eye, whereas the foramen would only have been able to provide this after some modification, as in lacertids and scincids.”

In his richest and most extensive analysis, Arnold then discusses six sepa­rate evolutionary innovations of “sand-diving” among lizards (quick entry into aeolian dunes to escape predators). He finds all six to be equivalent, both in efficacy and as solutions to the same functional requirement. “In no in­stance,” he writes (p. 156), “is there evidence that the different methods employed reflect different mechanical problems.” In his combination of func­tional and cladistic analysis, he interprets the mechanisms used for sand-

diving as directly adaptive (that is, first evolved in conjunction with, and pre­sumably for, the behavior) in two cases, but as exaptive in the other four se­quences. Interestingly, the exaptive lineages coopted their sand-diving move­ments from two different functional sources in ancestral lineages: from “part of the drilling mechanism used in firm substrates” (p. 161) by ancestral lin­eages that hide themselves in harder grounds, and “from the burial pattern adopted before periods of inactivity” (p. 161) in other ancestral lineages (that is, from movements carried out much more slowly, in a clandestine fashion, and for purposes of dormancy rather than escape from predators).

Two additional criteria might be cited as evidence for both the use and usefulness of exaptation as a concept in evolutionary biology, and in other forms of historical study as well.

1. Utility in fields distant from evolutionary biology. Markey (1997) in­voked our concept of exaptation to explain the peculiar history of the letter perth in the runic alphabet of futhark. (The word “futhark” is an acronym for the first six letters of the runic alphabet, just as “alphabet” itself combines the first two letters of the Greek sequence, alpha and beta.) Perth must have had ordinary phonemic value in a still earlier system, but the letter is never glossed in futhark texts and has left no descendants in any Germanic lan­guage. (Actually, the letter occurs only one time in all runic literature — in the English Rune Poem.)

Markey (1997) argues that, having lost its original phonemic use, “the p-rune appears to have been a redundant luxury” (p. 10). Some versions of later futhark alphabets simply eliminated the symbol, but others retained the p-rune, apparently for an interesting structural reason with excellent literary analogy to quirky functional shift in biological features. The p-rune hap­pened to stand right at the middle of the futhark alphabet, where its phone­mic suppression encouraged a different use as a place marker or mnemonic guide, at the halfway point of a long sequence more easily recalled in two di­vided halves. (Markey shows that several versions of futhark added letters, but always kept the p-rune right in the middle of the sequence.)

Markey argues that the p-rune, phonemically extinct in Germanic tongues, then lost its exapted function as a place marker when these languages re­placed the runic alphabet with our current Latin system. At this point, the p-rune again resisted extinction by another exaptation, this time for spelling Latin loan words with an initial p sound before a vowel (as in papa for “pope,” or pater for “priest”), a phonemic combination not found in Ger­manic words. (Runic-p served the same function for some English loan words of non Indo-European origin, as in “pebble.”) In any case, Markey (p. 11) found our biological concept of exaptation useful in describing this complex double quirky functional shift from ordinary phonemic value in a hypotheti­cal ancestor, to place marking in futhark, to renewed phonemic value for loan words when the Latin alphabet replaced futhark: “Exaptation is manifested by functional bifurcation. The primary function of feathers was warmth, the secondary function flight. The primary function of runic-p appears to have been that of a boundary marker, while its secondary function was loan­word spelling. Runic-p has every appearance of having been coopted. Non-essential in the runic system, it must have been essential in some system, pre­sumably the parent of Older Futhark.”

In a fascinating exegesis of Emil Durkheim's seminal, late 19th century sociological studies of the division of labor, Catton (1998) invoked our concept of exaptation to explain a central error that Durkheim might not have com­mitted if he had recognized the principle of functional shift, either from Dar­win (whom he studied intensely), or from the more nearly contemporary Nietzsche. Durkheim recognized (correctly) that division of labor, and the at­tendant specialization of tasks in society, can greatly reduce competition and lead to “organic solidarity” (Catton, 1998, p. 89). But he then erred in as­suming that this current utility also permits the inference that division of la­bor arose, in explicit analogy with speciation, as a direct adaptation for its current function of reducing competition and stabilizing both social and eco­nomic systems. “To Durkheim,” Catton explains (p. 117), “it seemed abate­ment of competition by means of differentiation was the necessary removal of an otherwise insurmountable barrier to mutualistic interdependence. That was why division of labor was supposed to result in organic solidarity.”

But Catton then exposes the dilemma and logical error entailed by Durk­heim's commitment to an evolutionary analogy with speciation. For biolo­gists argue, and have demonstrated in many cases, that mutualistic interac­tions often evolve from initial antagonisms and exploitations: “Evolutionary ecologists now know that mutualism can evolve from antagonism ... by some modification of structure or behavior that changes the outcome of an interaction from which the parties cannot withdraw.”

The secondarily evolved cooperation may remain “good” for both parties, while so altering the initial state of the system that origins cannot be inferred from this current utility. Catton (1998, p. 118) found our discussion of exap­tation useful in explaining this important concept to his colleagues. (He also shows his appreciation of the corollary that secondary adaptation for a new role does not impeach the exaptive origin of the coopted utility): “An adapta­tion has a function. An exaptation has an effect. Once that effect becomes im­portant in the life of an organic type (in its new environment), natural selec­tion may 'improve' the exapted trait, eventually making it an adaptation, and converting the effect into a true function.”

2. Passage of the term from explicitly cited novelty to general and unrefer­enced usage in evolutionary literature. The sequence may be bittersweet for originators, but only the most narcissistic or insecure scientist could fail to take pleasure when a concept of his invention, or an experiment of his doing, loses explicit connection to his authorship by “evolution” into an ordinary term of art within the profession. This form of acquired anonymity crowns the diffusion to general success of a suggestion or innovation with a “point source” of origin, now happily forgotten and relegated to the domain of anti­quarian or historical studies.

Exaptation has already passed through the three major stages of this se­quence. In a first stage, exaptation, as a novel term, became an explicit focus for studies to test or illustrate its utility — as in Arnold's title (to his 1994 pa­per, discussed above): “Investigating the origins of performance advantage: adaptation, exaptation and lineage effects”; or in Almada and Santos (1995): “Parental care in the rocky intertidal: a case study of adaptation and exap­tation in Mediterranean and Atlantic blennies.”

In a second stage, the concept serves, inter alia, as part of an ordinary anal­ysis, and not as an explicit focus of study — but the term still requires a cita­tion to its source of origin, or at least must be defined and presented within quotation marks. For example, Chatterjee (1997), advocating the currently less popular “trees down” arboreal (rather than the “ground up” terrestrial) theory for the origin of birds, argued that many climbing adaptations of tree-dwelling ancestors “were exapted for gliding” in the transitional stages to­wards full flight. The language of Chatterjee's full sentence records an inter­esting, and undoubtedly unconscious, intermediary stage in the acceptance of functional shift as a principle in evolutionary analysis: “Surprisingly, many of these arboreal innovations were exapted for gliding” (p. 311). But such cooptations and functional shifts can only be deemed “surprising” when con­trasted with expectations of continuous improvement within a single “adap­tive zone” (to use Simpson's classical terminology of 1944). Once we recog­nize functional shift and cooptation as important components in almost any extensive evolutionary sequence, we will no longer label exaptations as sur­prising.

In an example from the most fecund realm of exaptation in molecular evolution, Weiner and Maizels (1999) explained to their biochemical col­leagues who may not be au courant with the literature of evolutionary theory: “Those with an evolutionary bent sometimes use the word 'exaptation' to describe the appropriation of a molecule with one job for a completely dif­ferent purpose. Exaptation contrasts with 'adaptation,' a seemingly natu­ral extension of preexisting functions” (1999, p. 64). Their article, entitled “a deadly double life,” documents the fascinating “remarkable discovery” (1999, p. 63) that the carboxyl-terminal domain of human tyrosyl-transfer RNA synthetase (the enzyme that catalyzes the attachment of the amino acid tyrosine to the appropriate tRNA molecule prior to protein synthesis) shows clear homology (49 percent sequence similarity) with a cytokine performing the quite different — one might say conceptually opposite — function of at­tracting phagocytic cells to sites of apoptosis, suggesting in a broader sense that “secretion of tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase may help to shut down residual protein synthesis in the dying cell” (p. 63).

In this case, the synthetase activity seems primary (for a set of reasons elaborated in Weiner and Maizels, 1999), and the “opposite” role in cell death secondary, following gene duplication, and leading to the molecule's “deadly double life.” Weiner and Maizels (1999) argue that the utility in apoptosis originates as an exaptation recruited from an “accidental” effect of the gene's primary activity: “The recruitment of tryrosyl-tRNA synthetase as an extracellular death messenger” (p. 64) follows from its primary role and allows these molecules to “serve as harbingers of impending cell death when released from their normal cellular compartments”: “Release of proteins from their normal locations in the cell may have originally been a symptom of cell death, rather than a cause of it. Evolution may then have exploited the accidental [their italics] release of these proteins (and possibly others) to build, amplify, and eventually fine-tune the death circuitry.”

Finally, in a third phase, the term enters the literature as a standard item of professional lingo, requiring no further citation of original sources (probably unknown to the authors in any case) than any other word of professional jar­gon. Thus, Jablonski and Chaplin (1999, p. 836) view manual dexterity and eventual tool use as human exaptations of a bipedal posture that originally arose as part of a common threat display in ancestral apes, and Roy (1996) analyzes exaptations for defense in the fossil history of stromboid gastropod shells.

I take greatest pleasure, however, in the spread of exaptation as a term of art in the most pervasively expressed domain of molecular evolution. For example, in a review article on “interspersed repeats and other mementos of transposable elements in mammalian genomes,” Smit (1999) consistently uses exaptation to describe coopted utilities of multiply repeated and dis­persed transposable elements (the classic molecular items that inspired the concept of “selfish DNA,” see pp. 693–695 for further discussion).

In a section of a paper on “domestication of individual transposable ele­ments” (p. 661, and I do appreciate his witty and apposite metaphors from the vernacular), Smit writes: “Throughout time, host genomes have rum­maged through the novel sequences accumulated by transposition and have recruited numerous elements . . . Far from merely expanding genomes with interspersed repeats, their legacy ranges from spliceosomal introns and antigen-specific immunity to many recent recruits in highly specialized func­tions” (1999, pp. 661-662). Although Smit notes an apparently reduced exaptive role for such transposons in humans vs. mice, “leading to speculations on host defense mechanisms” (p. 657) in our species, he also lists an impressive array of potential human examples, “some with household names” (p. 661). For example, Smit cites a fascinating exaptation of all higher pri­mates, probably essential to the existence of this book and any reader's kind and current attention thereto: “BC200, the only known fully recruited SINE in humans, is a brain specific RNA that is part of a ribonucleoprotein com­plex preferentially located in the dendrites of all higher primates. It is presum­ably derived about 50 million years ago from a monomeric Alu and has since been selectively conserved in all studied descendants.”

Note Smit's proper conceptual separation of initial cooptation from later retention by natural selection. Following both Darwin and Nietzsche, the sec­ondary adaptive enhancement by natural selection (in this case, perhaps, merely a selective retention without further structural change) — that is, the promotion of the current utility — does not permit a conclusion about the dif­ferent cause of historical origin (in this case, presumably as an exaptation from repeated copies of a transposon, replicated and amplified for quite dif­ferent reasons, and probably initially nonadaptive at the primary Darwinian level of the organismal phenotype).

The concepts of functional shifting, the structuralist implications thereof, the classical examples (especially the exaptation of feathers for flight), and the terminology of cooptation and exaptation, were all worked out on the conventional “playing field” of anatomies and behaviors of complex multi-cellular organisms. But this rubric of theory and argument will surely enjoy its greatest application in the domain of molecular evolution, where the func­tional redundancy of multiple usage for most gene products and the struc­tural redundancy of duplications and repeated elements enlarge the scope of functional shifting away from mere striking illustrations, and towards ubiq­uity. (Note how this pairing, at the molecular level, of several functions for one gene with several genes for one function precisely matches the logic of Darwin's anatomical argument for the structural prerequisites of quirky func­tional shift — see p. 107 for my discussion in terms of Darwin's favorite exam­ple of lungs and swim bladders in the evolution of fishes.) Classical cases are already beginning to emerge from this level of analysis, perhaps none more complex and fascinating, or more widely cited, than the work of J. Piatigorsky, G. Wistow and many others on the eye-lens crystallins of both vertebrates and invertebrates.

The crystallins are structural elements that constitute about 90 percent of the total soluble protein of eye lenses in most vertebrates. Most crystallins are found in lens fibers, which lose their nuclei (and other organelles) and must therefore, since they cannot replenish by division, remain stable through the organism's life (Piatigorsky, 1992). In beginning an invited review to a society of ophthalmologists, Piatigorsky (1993a) explained (to a group of profes­sional biologists who generally lack specialized training in evolutionary the­ory) how functionalist and adaptationist biases had led to longstanding as­sumptions that must now be discarded (1993a, p. 283):

As scientists and physicians we are accustomed to seeking order and pur­pose in the world. It is commonplace for us to think that specialized tasks require custom made instrumentation, the more sophisticated the mission, the more honed the result . . . And so for approximately 100 years vision scientists have considered the crystallins as a very limited set of highly specialized proteins especially chosen and designed for their ability to confer the required refractive properties onto the transparent lens. We have grown up with the idea that crystallins are as specialized as the eye itself.



Molecular and genetic studies of the 1980's and 1990's have dramatically reversed this view by identifying crystallins as a diverse set of exapted en­zymes and proteins with strikingly different original functions, often still maintained. Piatigorsky continued (1993a, p. 283): “Recent studies, how­ever, have changed this restricted view and have shown that crystallins are es­sentially borrowed proteins of diverse origins. These lens structural proteins not only play a refractive role in the lens, but they have important non-refractive functions within and outside of the eye.”

Vertebrate crystallins have been divided into two groups (Wistow, 1993; Lee et al., 1994): the structural stress-proteins of the alpha and beta/gamma crystallin group found in most vertebrate lenses; and the highly diverse, so-called “taxon specific” crystallins, generally found in more restricted lin­eages, and exapted from enzymes that continue to operate in their earlier manner elsewhere in the body (and often in the lens as well).

The structural proteins of the first group also represent exaptations, rather than direct adaptations, for vision. This cascade of reinterpretation began in the early 1980's with the discovery that alpha crystallins are homologs of the small heat shock proteins of Drosophila. One of the two alpha crystal­lin genes continues to produce a heat shock protein (Piatigorsky et al., 1994), while the other has become more specialized for lens functions, although both also continue to act as molecular chaperones. The beta/gamma crystal­lins (Piatigorsky and Wistow, 1991) are more distantly related to microbial dormancy proteins, also inducible by osmotic shock and other stresses.

But the second group of «taxon specific» crystallins shows far more diver­sity in their multiple routes of exaptation from previous functions (often still retained) as enzymes. For example, delta crystallin of chickens is arginino-succinate lyase; epsilon crystallin of ducks is identical with the metabolic en­zyme lactate dehydrogenase; tau crystallin of turtles is alpha-enolase; and mu crystallin, found in many marsupials, is ornithine cyclodeaminase (Piatigor­sky, 1993b). In a proof of multiple recruitability in independent events across great phyletic distances, the eta crystallin that constitutes more than 25 per­cent of soluble proteins in the lens of elephant shrews is the enzyme cytoplasmic aldehyde dehydrogenase (Piatigorsky and Wistow, 1991), whereas the omega crystallin of octopuses has also been exapted from aldehyde dehydro­genase in a separate cephalopod event (Piatigorsky et al., 1994). The theme of lens proteins as exapted enzymes then extends to further phyletic diversity, for the major lens component of squid S crystallin, is related to the detoxifica­tion enzyme glutathione S-transferase.

Piatigorsky (1993a, p. 284) summarizes the dominant role of exaptation for the origin and status of lens crystallins: “A number of the crystallins have been shown to be expressed outside of the lens and to possess its original nonrefractive activity. Indeed, a hallmark of an enzyme-crystallin is that it is expressed at high concentration in the refractive lens and at a much lower concentration in other tissues, where it has at least one other non-refractive role.”

Since examples of exaptation always raise the structuralist theme of preconditions for recruitment, we must ask what common properties of proteins and enzymes in this large array of highly disparate sources prompts or facili­tates cooptation as lens crystallins. Some evident requirements — with trans­parency as the most obvious property — probably represent merely incidental and nonadaptive consequences of molecular structures evolved for other rea­sons, in the same evident sense that natural selection did not make our blood red or our bones white for any directly adaptive reason rooted in the colors themselves. But although transparency surely stands as a primary prerequi­site, many other enzymes and proteins share this necessary property, but have never been recruited as lens crystallins — so more specific preconditions must be sought (Wistow, 1993; Piatigorsky, 1993a and b). Piatigorsky (1993a, p. 285) lists “high solubility in water to achieve the high concentrations nec­essary to attain the appropriate refractive index and thermodynamic stabil­ity, since loss of cell nuclei in the fiber cells prevents turnover in this region of the lens.”

Even more specifically, Wistow (1993, pp. 303-304) notes that all cellular lenses require unusually elongated cells as building blocks — a common prop­erty or potential, as Wistow argues, of the original utilities from which lens crystallins have been exapted: “As the lens evolved, the necessary refractive power must have been achieved by recruiting genes that are active under the prevailing conditions of cell elongation and whose protein products fit the broad requirements of their new role. Osmotic stress proteins, cytoskeleton chaperones and easily inducible detoxification enzymes would have been good candidates. Such an origin could have engendered underlying similari­ties in gene expression for groups of crystallins.”

But the case of crystallins owes its emerging status as a “classic” of exaptation largely to the strong evidence gathered for a range of structural pre­requisites and preconditions that can facilitate such functional shifts. Arnold (1994) has proposed a set of subcategories for sources and styles of exaptation (see also Gould and Vrba, 1982), and I shall devote the final section of this chapter (pp. 1277–1294) to the further development of such taxonomy and to exploring its implications for macroevolutionary patterns and possi­bilities. The subject has assumed some urgency in studies of molecular evolu­tion because the crucially important mechanism of gene duplication has fre­quently been overextended and interpreted as virtually the only possible basis for exaptation — when a gene with an important function duplicates (Ohno, 1970, for the classic statement), thereby “freeing” one copy for cooptation to a different utility. Exaptation does occur by duplication in the evolution of some lens crystallins, but other exapted crystallins are products of a single gene that continues to make the critical enzyme of its presumably original function — a process that Piatigorsky and Wistow (1989) called “gene shar­ing,” and that Darwin explicitly recognized in citing organs with two distinct functions as good candidates for quirky functional shift (see p. 1223).

For example, the duck genome includes only a single gene to code for both the exapted lens crystallin and the original enzyme in at least two cases: epsilon crystallin (lactate dehydrogenase B) and tau crystallin (alpha-enolase). In some cases, the lens crystallins even retain their enzymatic activity within the eye. The zeta crystallin of several hystricomorph rodents is quinone oxido-reductase, and may protect the eye against oxidation “or even filter UV radia­tion” (Wistow, 1993, p. 301). The amount of epsilon crystallin in many birds, produced by the same single-copy gene that codes for the enzyme lac­tate dehydrogenase B, also correlates well with exposure to light, and may provide enzymatic protection as well as visual refraction (Wistow, 1993, p. 301).

As an example of exaptation associated with duplication, two genes pro­duce delta crystallin in chickens and ducks, with the deltai gene specialized for lens expression, and the delta2 gene producing the same enzyme, arginino-succinate lyase, in non-lens tissue, but also generating some lens crys­tallin as well. Interestingly, both genes are equally active in the duck lens, which thus includes ASL enzyme activity (through the enhanced action of the delta2 gene) at a 1500 fold higher level than in chicken lenses (for no under­stood function as yet).

A presumably much older duplication occurred in the alpha crystallins present in most vertebrates, with the alphaA and alphaB genes now residing on different chromosomes. The alphaA gene has specialized for production of its lens crystallin, but maintains some activity in other organs of some species. However, the alphaB gene has retained more of its original function in gener­ating a heat shock protein, while also coding for lens crystallin.

Interestingly, and beginning to unite crucial themes of the last two chap­ters, the alphaA crystallin gene of chickens is regulated by at least 5 control sites (Cvekl et al., 1994). Sites C and E bind Pax-6 (the famously homologous “master regulator” of eye development in squids, arthropods, and verte­brates — see pp. 1123–1132) in the lens to stimulate alphaA crystallin promotor activity, thus controlling high expression of this gene in the lens and repression in fibroblasts (Cvekl et al., 1994, p. 7363). These authors also report that Pax-6 binds to the lens-specific regulatory enhancer of the delta! crystallin gene of chickens, and to the lens-specific regulatory sequence of the zeta crystallin gene of guinea pigs.

Finally, some lens crystallin genes undergo more extensive duplication, usually followed by a further specialization of some copies for lens functions, as expected. “For the beta and gamma crystallins, multiple gene duplications have led to gene families with six or more members that seem to be special­ized for lens” (Piatigorsky and Wistow, 1991, p. 1079). In the most extensive example of duplication, the squid genome includes at least 10 S-crystallin genes, all derived from the gene that produces the glutathione S-transferase (GST) enzyme. These S-crystallin genes are expressed only in the lens and cor­nea and now lack enzymatic function, with one exception of “very slight GST activity” in a single S-crystallin (Piatigorsky et al., 1994, p. 243): “The S-crystallin genes encoding the inactive enzyme derivatives have acquired an additional exon which probably contributes to the loss of enzyme activity of the crystallin.”

To close this long section, and these details of a developing classic, with a lovely corroborative tale in the venerable tradition of natural history, the squid Euprymna scolopes collects phosphorescent bacterial symbionts in a “light organ” located in the center of its mantle cavity. “The squid uses the light emitted by the symbiotic bacteria in its behavior, presumably in anti-predatory displays and/or intraspecific communication” (Montgomery and McFall-Ngai, 1992, p. 21000). The light organ also includes a lens formed as a thick pad of transparent tissue, and built by the squid as a derivative of muscle from its hindgut. “The tissue functions as a convex lens to refract the light from the localized bacterial source over the ventral surface of the squid” (Montgomery and McFall-Ngai, 1992, p. 21000). (Incidentally, I shall never forget the kindness of these authors, or the eerie fascination of this system in these remarkable animals, when I had the privilege of visiting their lab in the early 1990's.)

The ocular lens of squid is epidermally derived and used for sight. This sec­ond and entirely different kind of lens, both in development and function, is built from muscle tissue and operates to enhance and refract the light gener­ated by symbiotic bacteria! Yet the lens crystallin of the muscle-derived light enhancer, called L-crystallin by Montgomery and McFall-Ngai, is apparently exapted from an ALDH-like enzyme, as is the eta crystallin of the ocular lens of elephant shrews and the omega crystallin of the ocular lens of octopuses, both discussed previously. Montgomery and McFall-Ngai (1992, p. 21003) argue that enzymatic activity of ALDH may be preserved for protection against peroxidative damage. They end their paper with both an observation and a challenge: “Possibly, ALDH was first recruited for such a purpose, and then secondarily converted in some species to serve a largely structural role. However, as is the case with all other enzyme/crystallins discovered, why ALDH was selected [I would say exapted] as a structural protein is un­known.”





THE COMPLETE VERSION, REPLETE WITH SPANDRELS: EXAPTATION AND THE TERMINOLOGY OF NONADAPTIVE ORIGIN





The more radical category of exapted features with truly

nonadaptive origins as structural constraints


Throughout the previous section, I emphasized how the theme of quirky functional shift, and the resulting discordance between reasons for historical origin and the adaptive basis of current utility, introduced an important structuralist component into the otherwise functionalist logic of Darwinian theory. In particular, the developmental prerequisites and structural poten­tials of any ancestral state — and not only the adaptive pressures emanating from present environments — must be factored in as both limits and facilita­tors for evolutionary change, thereby acting as constraints (in both positive and negative senses) upon phylogenetic pathways.

Nonetheless, as also emphasized throughout (and in the subsection's title of “the restricted Darwinian version”), the basic concept of exaptation remains consistent with orthodox Darwinism (while expanding its purview and add­ing some structural clarification and sophistication) for an obvious reason: the principle of quirky functional shift does not challenge the control of evo­lution by natural selection as an adaptational process. Unpredictable shift of function may establish the ground of contingency, and may imply a role for structural constraints upon phyletic pathways. But this principle does not un­dermine the functionalist basis of evolutionary change because features so affected remain adaptive throughout: they originate for one function (presum­ably by natural selection), and then undergo quirky shift to a different utility.

However, the principle of functional shift, combined with Nietzsche's ar­gument about the invalidity of inferring historical origin from current util­ity, implies a disarmingly simple and logical extension that does challenge the rule of Darwinian mechanics and functionalist control over evolutionary change. Ironically, the very simplicity of the argument has often led to its dis­missal as too obvious to hold any theoretical importance — a “feeling” that I shall try to refute in this section, and whose disproof represents an important step in the central logic of this book.

The deeper challenge posed to orthodox Darwinism by the principle of functional shifting flows from the implication that, if current utility does not reveal reasons for historical origin, then these initial reasons need not be adaptational or functional at all — for features with current adaptive status may have originated for nonadaptive reasons in an ancestral form. In other words, and in the terminology of Table 11-1, when current aptations rank as exaptations rather than adaptations, their coopted source will be identifiable as an ancestral structure with either adaptive origins (for a different function) or nonadaptive origins (for no function at all). (I do accept the standard view that strongly wadaptive features hold little prospect for an evolutionary leg­acy because natural selection must soon eliminate them. But raoraadaptive — that is, effectively or nearly neutral — features may persist for several rea­sons, including the “invisibility” of true neutrality to pressures of selection, and the status of many nonaptations as automatic architectural byproducts, as in Darwin's “correlations of growth” or Gould and Lewontin's “span­drels.”)

The logical validity and evident application of this simple argument cannot be gainsaid. Indeed, several examples, mentioned inter alia in the preceding section on exaptation, fall into this category of features with current utility exapted from a nonadaptive ancestral status. The optical property of trans­parency, shared by all the diverse proteins and enzymes that have been ex­apted as lens crystallins, may represent a trivial and automatic consequence of physical and chemical structures evolved for other reasons. But this purely derivative and nonadaptive feature still stands as a gatekeeper and prerequi­site for exaptation to vision. We may regard Darwin's example of non-fusion of skull sutures in mammalian neonates as a far richer and less obvious case. For we need, in this example, to unravel enough specific history of mamma­lian descent to know that this property arose in ancestors born from eggs, and therefore cannot be a direct adaptation, initially evolved to compress the head and permit passage through the narrow mammalian birth canal. (We should also remember that Darwin explicitly declined to call non-fusion an “adaptation” for this reason, even while he acknowledged the functional ne­cessity for such a property in the evolution of mammalian live birth.)

The general conclusion may be stated in a simple manner, but I believe that the resulting implications for evolutionary theory are both profound and curiously underappreciated: If many features that operate as adaptations under present regimes of natural selection were exapted from ancestral features with nonadaptive origins — and were not built as direct adaptations for their current use (or exapted from ancestral features with adaptive origins for different functions) — then we cannot explain all pathways of evolutionary change under functionalist mechanics of the theory of natural selection. In­stead, we must allow that many important (and currently adaptive) traits originated for nonadaptive reasons that cannot be attributed to the direct ac­tion of natural selection at all and, moreover, cannot be inferred from the exaptive utility of the trait in living species. Because the subject of evolution­ary biology must engage many crucial questions about the origins of features, and cannot be confined to the study of current utilities and selective regimes, nonadaptationist themes therefore assume an important role in any full ac­count of life's history and the mechanisms of evolutionary change.

The key to this expansion of evolutionary theory therefore lies in the cate­gory of currently useful traits with nonadaptive origins — my rationale for prefacing this topic with two sections to develop the prerequisites of the argu­ment: one on Nietzsche's principle of general discordance between bases of current utility and reasons for historical origin, and another on the terminol­ogy of exaptation as a framework for describing and appreciating the impor­tance of currently useful structures coopted from a different ancestral status, rather than directly evolved for their present function. By introducing, in this final section, the theme of exaptations based upon features with nonadaptive origins, I complete the chart of Table 11-1 (see p. 1233) by recognizing two subcategories of exaptation: (1) Cooptations of features that originated for different adaptive reasons — the principle of “quirky functional shift” that en­riches (with structuralist “flavor”), but does not challenge, the functionalist control of evolution by natural selection, and that also establishes the ground of contingency within the Darwinian world view. (2) Cooptations of features with nonadaptive origins — the theoretically radical category that precludes any complete explanation of evolution in adaptationist terms, and that pro­vides a nonadaptationist alternative for evolutionary inquiry about the ori­gins of currently adaptive biological features.

But if this argument is so simple to state, so airtight in logic, and at least interesting (I would say profound, but not with everyone's initial approbation!) in its implications for evolutionary theory, then why hasn't the category of currently useful features with nonadaptive origins been perceived as more troublesome by orthodox Darwinians? Why, to sharpen the paradox, did the concept not even receive a name in conventional theory? This complex ques­tion embraces many dimensions, including psychological and historical influ­ences lying well beyond my professional competence and the scope of this book. But, for the relevant dimension of the structure of Darwinian theory, two strong reasons — both invalid in my view, with their refutation as the pri­mary aim of this section — have permitted most defenders of strict natural se­lection to acknowledge the existence of nonadaptive features, but then to rel­egate them to a periphery of rarity and impotence where they can exert no effective role in setting pathways for the history of life, or in specifying principles of evolutionary theory. Both arguments flow from the assumption (which I do not challenge) that most nonadaptive traits of organisms arise as struc­tural consequences of selection upon other features, or upon other aspects of the same trait. (I speak here of traits with enough stability and complexity to become exapted for meaningful utility in a descendant lineage. No one doubts, of course, that many truly trivial features of organisms have no bear­ing upon fitness, and lie well beneath the visibility of natural selection):

Nooks and crannies. Darwinians have generally argued that most structural consequences of natural selection on other features can survive as true nonadaptations (and not be eliminated as inadaptive) only if they occupy little space or require minimal metabolic input. The mold marks on old bot­tles (made in two-piece molds) surely testify to mechanisms of manufacture, but serve no purpose. If we regarded them as ugly, or if they disrupted a bot­tle's utility, we could easily remove them. But we allow them to persist in their inconsequential triviality.

Secondary and consequential status. This common argument commits the historical error that inspired Nietzsche's warning. Many people have assumed that nonadaptive origin as a consequence of selection upon an­other feature relegates a trait to permanent insignificance because it arose in a passive and sequential manner — a clear conflation of reasons for historical origin with potentials for subsequent utility. Perhaps, in an ancestral pelycosaur, the skull sutures remained unfused (at birth from an egg) as a trivial consequence of some developmental necessity in a forthcoming and free-living ontogeny. But this nonadaptive property may later become the prereq­uisite to the success of mammalian descendants, when live birth became the autapomorphic key to a new and highly successful mode of life.





Defining and defending spandrels: a revisit to San Marco


When I chose the notorious spandrels of San Marco to illustrate these falla­cies with an architectural analogy that might not automatically raise the hackles of orthodox Darwinians (or thicken the scales over their eyes, to cite the other common biological metaphor for resistance to unfamiliar ideas), and also to introduce a term for the most common category of nonadaptive features with high potential for subsequent exaptive utility, I did not make a capricious selection for idiosyncratic reasons of personal interest (Gould and Lewontin, 1979). Rather, I chose this Venetian example because the historical record and current status of these particular four pendentives includes a suf­ficient richness and certainty of documentation to refute all the common objections raised against similar claims for the evolutionary insignificance of nonadaptive features in biological systems.*

When a hemispherical dome stands on a set of four rounded arches meet­ing at right angles to form a square — a very common design in ecclesiastical architecture and many other buildings — four tapering triangular spaces must appear directly under the dome, each formed by the space left over between the dome itself (above) and the pair of adjacent arches (at the sides) meeting at right angles (see Figure 11-8). These four spaces, called pendentives, must form as a structurally necessary side consequence of the architect's basic deci­sion to mount a dome on four rounded arches, so arrayed. Lewontin and I never claimed that these spaces did nothing useful (for obvious and trivial starters, their roofing keeps out the birds and the rain). But we did argue that their ineluctable size and shape — their number and triangular form — arose as side consequences of a previous architectural decision, and could not be viewed as adaptations in themselves. (The four pendentives, in other words and by analogy with my previous example, hold the same status as mold marks on an old bottle — necessary side consequences of an architectural deci­sion, not functional features in themselves.)

The general architectural term for such “spaces left over” is spandrel — a lovely name derived from the primordial human tool of measurement, the span of our own hand (or of the corresponding feature in an anthrop­omorphized divine architect — as in Isaiah's God (40:11-12) “who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span”). Classical spandrels are two-dimensional spaces left over (Figure 11-9) including the vertical boards between steps of a staircase, the triangu­lar spaces between arches arrayed in a linear row, and the flat horizontal stretches (called “spandrel courses”) on large office buildings, located between the tops of windows on the floor below and the bottoms of windows in the next story just above. Apparently — see documentation in Gould, 1997e — some architects restrict the term “spandrel” to two-dimensional spaces left over, whereas others, particularly in European usage, extend the term to any space that arises as a side-consequence of a prior decision, and not as an ex­plicitly designed feature in itself, thus including the three-dimensional pen­dentives of San Marco and thousands of other buildings. In any case, I con­sciously decided to apply this remarkably appropriate term to San Marco's pendentives because their shared property with classical two-dimensional spandrels — their status as architectural byproducts (at least for their forms, numbers, and placements) — cannot be denied. I also felt that biology needed a term for such architectural sequelae of “adaptive” decisions, and that this well known term from a related discipline could serve admirably.

11-9. A three-dimensional spandrel, or pen-dentive, contrasted with a more conventional two dimensional spandrel between arches in a linear row (below). From Gould, 1997e.





In any case, although spandrels must originate as necessary side-consequences of an architectural decision, and not as forms explicitly chosen to serve a purpose, they still exist in undeniable abundance, and can therefore be secondarily used in important and interesting ways by clever architects, artists and patrons of buildings. (I grew up in New York City, and have al­ways admired the lovely ornamentations on the spandrel courses of many of our finest art-deco skyscrapers, particularly the zoological motifs on the Chanin Building just opposite Grand Central Station.) In my “holotype” of the central dome of San Marco's cathedral in Venice, where the entire interior space has been covered in glorious mosaics, the four pendentives of the central dome have been ornamented in a complex way, stunningly well “fit” both for the space occupied, and for the symbolic meanings portrayed by the mo­saic designs. The four evangelists (including St. Mark, the cathedral's patron and most celebrated resident interred therein) occupy the widest top sec­tions of the spandrels, under a motto in Latin doggerel: Sic actus Christi, describuunt quatuor isti — thus did these four describe the acts of Christ. Be­neath the evangelists, in the narrowing triangular spaces, personifications of Eden's four rivers (see Genesis 2) hold amphoras (Greek pitchers) over their shoulders, each pouring water onto a single flower wedged into the narrow and elongated space at the base of each pendentive.

The design — beautiful, complex, and particularly appropriate both to Christian symbolic representation and to the surrounding space — exudes util­ity. But no one would make the mistake of arguing that the spandrels exist to house the evangelists. The spandrels originated as a nonadaptive side-consequence of a prior architectural decision. These originally nonadaptive spaces were then coopted (several centuries later, in this case) as “canvasses” for wonderfully appropriate designs. In biological terms, the mosaic designs are secondary adaptations, and the spandrels themselves then become exaptations for the residency of these designs. Again, I chose this architectural analog because I felt that a similarly unambiguous case in organisms might become conceptually muddled — for biologists have been trained to regard anything that “works well” as an adaptation, and might therefore not “see” the originally nonadaptive nature of the spaces. But I felt — rightly, in retro­spect — that this quite precise architectural analog would not generate enough emotional salience to act as a barrier against understanding the intended point.

A desire for clarity in illustration served as my primary motive, but our original article (Gould and Lewontin, 1979) does not sufficiently emphasize my other major reason for choosing this example as a “holotype” to illustrate the important category of nonadaptive features originating as architectural side consequences. I chose the San Marco spandrels because they so evidently refute, in terms of the architectural analogy, the two standard arguments raised against a similar importance for nonadaptive structures in biological morphology (as outlined above on p. 1249):

Nooks and crannies. One cannot brand the spandrels as trivial in occupied space or peripheral position — as one might legitimately hold for the mold marks on a bottle. The four spandrels under any dome occupy a sub­stantial area, surely equal to a large percentage (if not the totality) of the area of the dome above. As we shall see, this generous size and central place­ment also refutes a major aspect of the second dismissal based on consequentiality.

Consequentiality. The false inference of evolutionary insignificance from secondary original status as a side-consequence of a primary adaptation includes two arguments of different logical standing, but each equally invalid:

1. The empirical claim. For biological examples, many scientists have assumed that the temporally sequential status of any exapted utility (as im­posed upon a primary nonadaptation) must relegate any subsequent use to marginal importance. Thus, the evangelists and rivers are adaptive in their purposeful and lovely fit within a preexisting (and initially nonadaptive) space, and in their important message as conveyed within the larger aim of the building's role as a Christian church. But these mosaic designs are just as surely secondary and sequential — as later adaptations restricted by prior con­straints upon the number and form of an initially nonadaptive housing. The mosaicists made an adaptive choice, but preexisting constraints strongly lim­ited their options. The four spandrels could not house, in any easy or adap­tive way, the three children saved from the fiery furnace or the five books of Moses (not to mention the inelegance of setting 2.5 Commandments in each spandrel). Biologists often conflate a genuine limitation upon options with a false inference that constrained solutions, however adaptive, cannot generate structures of major importance either to the current working of organisms, or to their future evolutionary potential.

But, as Nietzsche argued, a secondary and constrained origin implies noth­ing about potential for either present or future importance — and the designs in San Marco's spandrels clearly expose this fallacy. Extensive feedback from the spandrels to the mosaics of the dome proves that secondary features can exert pervasive influence upon the basic design of a totality. The domes of San Marco are radially symmetrical and therefore provide, in se and considered alone, no reason for favoring a quadripartite mosaic design. Yet all but one of San Marco's five domes contain mosaics arranged in four-part symmetry — clearly, in each case, to harmonize with the iconography in the four triangular spandrels below. For example, in the mosaic design of our “holotype” central dome, three circles of figures radiate out from a central image of Christ: an­gels, disciples, and virtues. Each circle is divided into quadrants, even though the dome itself is radially symmetrical in structure. Each quadrant meets one of the four spandrels in the arches below the dome.

Another dome contains angels in the spandrels and the twelve apostles in the dome, arranged in four groups of three, with each group centered on one of the four spandrels below. Yet another dome presents four male saints in the dome and four female saints in the spandrels, with each male perfectly cen­tered between two of the females. Thus, an ineluctable architectural byprod­uct can, nonetheless, determine the fundamental design of a totality that or­dained its consequential origin. The natural world abounds in recursions and feedbacks of this sort. Mustn't the ever-cascading spandrels of the human brain be more weighty than the putative primary adaptations of ancient Afri­can hunter-gatherer ancestors in setting the outlines of what we now call “hu­man nature”?

2. The methodological claim based on operationality. As dis­cussed throughout this section, biologists have often been reluctant to base terminological distinctions on differing historical pathways to a similar cur­rent result — for the good reason that a poverty of historical records often de­nies us the data needed to reach a firm conclusion, whereas current situations can always be directly observed or experimentally manipulated. Thus, a biol­ogist might argue that the distinction between exaptation and adaptation, al­though logically sound and conceptually interesting, cannot be “cashed out” in a sufficiently high percentage of cases because we so often lack enough his­torical data to determine whether a currently useful structure originated by natural selection for its present function (adaptation) or got coopted to its current role from an initial status either as an adaptation for some other func­tion, or as a nonadaptive spandrel (exaptation).

I accept this point, of course, and have given my response in a previous sec­tion (p. 1233): when we cannot resolve the historical antecedents of a cur­rently useful feature, we need not apply the terminology of adaptation vs. exaptation at all. The feature remains an aptation (in its current status), and may be so named, whatever its unresolved historical origin. But I also admit that if the distinction between exaptation and adaptation can be drawn in only a small percentage of cases, and only under unusually favorable circum­stances, then the concepts enjoy little practical or operational use, and the terms might as well be abandoned in the actual practice of science.

However, I am confident that the distinction can be rigorously made in a high percentage of cases, probably a firm majority. If direct knowledge of his­torical sequences from paleontological data established the only path to reso­lution, then imperfections of the fossil record would preclude resolution at sufficient relative frequency. But evolutionary biologists can also reach firm conclusions about historical sequences from cladistic reconstructions of phyletic topography based upon the distribution of traits among living organ­isms. (I did not participate in the cladistic revolution within systematics, and I always maintained a cautiously critical, if basically supportive, attitude towards this scientific reform. But, and now in retrospect, I must credit cladistics with the signal achievement of devising a workable methodology for inferring historical and genealogical pathways from the distribution of fea­tures among modern organisms — thereby making the reconstruction of biological history operational as a generality, and not only in special cases of adequate evidence from the fossil record. Such an accomplishment marks a fundamental advance for a historical science like evolutionary biology — and cladistics must therefore be celebrated, if for no other reason, as one of the great achievements in the history of evolutionary thought.) In any case, my previous discussion of Arnold's work on sand-diving and crevice-dwelling lizards (pp. 1234–1238) illustrated the use of both criteria (direct historical sequencing and cladistic reconstruction) in distinguishing adaptation from exaptation in biological data.

The spandrels of San Marco provide an even clearer case — relatively free from biasing preferences imposed by our engrained assumptions about bio­logical structures — for the testability, and hence the operationality, of distinc­tions between adaptation and exaptation, using both major criteria of direct data and inferences from taxonomic structure. In fact, my initial choice of this example stemmed explicitly from the availability of definitive data in the rarely available category of preserved historical records of actual genealogical sequences.

To state the conceptual problem: One might strongly favor the hypothesis, based on structural arguments alone, that the spandrels originated as non-adaptive side consequences, and only later achieved utility in housing the evangelists — thus identifying this derived function as exaptive rather than adaptive. But the static evidence of architectural form cannot decide the his­torical issue, for the alternative interpretation remains logically unimpeach­able, however unlikely — and resolution therefore requires evidence about ac­tual historical sequences. That is, one might reverse the flow of causality and argue: why must I regard the spandrels as primary nonadaptations constrain­ing a later choice of aptive ornamentation? Perhaps the four evangelists rep­resent a primary impetus rather than a secondary accommodation. Perhaps the architect chose to build his church with domes mounted on sets of four rounded arches because he had such a terrific idea for festooning the resulting spandrels of the central dome with mosaics of the four evangelists and the four rivers of Eden. In this case, the spandrels would exist to house the evan­gelists, and the mosaic designs would become primary adaptations.

I chose the San Marco spandrels because, in this case, we have firm evi­dence in both categories to reject this alternative possibility, to affirm the ori­gin of spandrels as nonadaptive side consequences of a larger architectural decision, and to understand the mosaic designs as secondary adaptations within a space exapted for their utility.

(1) Direct historical data. We know that the spandrels were not built to house the evangelists because San Marco stood and operated in its appointed role as a church for at least three centuries before the mosaicists applied their astonishing work to a series of constrained and previously unornamented spaces (see Demus's classic four volume monograph (1984) on the history, ar­chitecture and iconography of San Marco).

(2) Inferences from taxonomic structure. Human buildings cannot be or­dered as branching genealogical systems following both Linnaean and Dar­winian logic — so we cannot base our inferences upon true cladograms in this case. But a taxonomy of ecclesiastical, and other large public, buildings does permit us to invoke a series of standard arguments, long utilized in the com­parative anatomy of organisms as well, and all indicating both a nonadaptive original status for the spandrels, and a secondarily adaptive role for the evan­gelists as good designs in exapted spaces:

1. Ubiquity vs. occasionality as evidence for both priority and necessity. Thousands of Western buildings feature domes atop rounded arches — and ev­ery single one of them generates tapering triangular spaces at the intersec­tions. These spandrels are ornamented in a wide variety of ways, each appro­priate to the local circumstance. Many carry no ornaments at all (indicating that spandrels must be generated but need not bear “adaptive” designs).

2. Constancy of form vs. variety in usage. How could such a diversity of employment always generate the same housing? This particular distribution of anatomical “features” indicates that a constant form preceded the various ornaments thereof (both historically in phyletic time in some cases, and struc­turally in ontogenetic and architectural sequence in all cases). I have, for ex­ample, noted various religious foursomes in the spandrels of other churches — the four major Old Testament prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel in many cases; or, in San Ignazio in Rome (and “politically correct” by current standards of gender equality), four Old Testament heroes and their weapons: David with his sling, Judith with her sword (to behead Holofernes), Samson with his jawbone, and Jael with her tentpost (to transfix Sisera through the head). I also have noted secular themes in civic or scientific building — the four continents of Africa, Europe, Asia, and America under the main dome of the Victor Emanuel arcade in Milan; four classical lawmakers (Justinian, Pericles, Solon, and Cicero) under the glass dome in the Victorian courtroom of the Landmark Center, St. Paul, Minnesota; four mainstays of civilization (peace, justice, industry, and agriculture) in the County Arcade of Leeds, England, built in 1900; or the four Greek elements in the pendentives under the main dome at the headquarters of the National Academy of Sci­ences in Washington, DC!

3. Suboptimal or ill-fitting designs as evidence of historical sequencing. As emphasized in Chapter 2, in my analysis of Darwin's rich and subtle methodology for historical inference, perfection covers the tracks of history, whereas oddities and imperfections often reveal both the direction and the stages of temporal sequences. When four evangelists establish an optimal de­sign in four spandrels, we cannot determine the sequence of events from the structure alone: either the spaces came first, and the evangelists fit in later, or plans to depict the evangelists came first, and architects then fashioned the spaces as appropriate housing. But a peculiar, ill-fitting, or suboptimal design might suggest an order of historical precedence. If three spandrels housed ele­gant mosaics of Genesis, Exodus, and Leviticus, while similar designs for Numbers and Deuteronomy appeared all scrunched together in an ugly and overcrowded fourth spandrel, we might assume (at least as a preferred hy­pothesis for further test) that the four spandrels originated for a different and prior reason, and that a later mosaicist miscalculated badly in formulating plans for placing symbols of the Torah into these preexisting spaces.

Similarly, the foursomes in several sets of spandrels in European churches seem rather forced or even ill fitting, thus indicating that a fixed number of spaces (and their form) preceded any decision about embellishment. In the 16th century church of San Fedele in Milan, for example, four concepts, personified as women, decorate the spandrels under the central dome — the famous biblical trio of faith, hope, and charity (1 Corinthians, 13), with the remaining fourth spandrel occupied by religion. Three spandrels might have carried the intended design better, but architectural constraints dictated a quartet, so the designers had to draft a fourth participant, however unsanctioned by a very famous quotation. By etymology, “religion” may mean, “tying together,” but this particular woman seems more out of place than integrative at San Fedele. Interestingly, the design of the great Romanesque pulpit in the Duomo of Pisa (the building adjacent to the structurally inadaptive but touristically highly exaptive Torre Pendente, or Leaning Tower) imposes no architectural necessity for a quartet of spandrels. Its lectern rests upon a tri­partite column that expands to three ornamental spaces at the top. The three spaces carry heads representing faith, hope, and charity — all by their proper selves this time, with no fourth interloper to complete the occupation of a preexisting architectural constraint.

4. Invariable correlation of a specific form under discussion with broader structural features of the totality. As an unprofound point in this case, the number of spandrels always correlates perfectly with the number of arches supporting an overlying dome — thus identifying the spandrels as automatic side consequences of a broader architectural decision. We might question this argument if all buildings mounted their domes on four arches, and therefore always generated pendentives in sets of four. But, although four remains by far the most common number, the comparative anatomy of large public buildings includes some variety. The central dome of St. Paul's Cathedral in London rests upon eight arches, and the resulting eight spandrels feature the four evangelists at the eastern end (where the sun rises upon novelty), con­trasted with the four great Old Testament prophets to the west (where the sun sets on ancient ways).





Three major reasons for the centrality of spandrels, and therefore

of nonadaptation, in evolutionary theory


I therefore find the concept of spandrels, or features of nonadaptive origin as structural byproducts or side consequences of other architectural decisions, to be both coherently definable and eminently testable. The importance of spandrels in evolutionary biology must then rest on two further attributes: (1) their engagement with conventional theory in a challenging way that suggests potentially important changes or expansions in our general understanding of evolution; and (2), their establishment as sufficiently common to constitute a high percentage of biologically and evolutionarily relevant traits of organisms and other biological individuals.

I think that spandrels pass the first test in a robust manner, for their exis­tence at high relative frequency (the claim of the second test) would challenge a key procedure of the adaptationist program that has long served as the day-to-day working methodology of Darwinian biologists engaged in the expla­nation of particulars. At the most basic level, we simply cannot gain an ade­quate evolutionary explanation for a trait by elucidating, however elegantly, however experimentally, and however quantitatively, its contribution to the fitness of the organisms or populations in which it now resides. Purely adap­tationist analysis therefore cannot resolve history for two major reasons:

1. Through the principle of quirky functional shift, and Nietzsche's discor­dance between reasons for current utility and sources of historical origin, our understanding of how a current trait works cannot elucidate its mode of ori­gin — an ineluctably and logically central task of evolutionary explanation, and one of the most interesting questions that any historical science can pose.

2. Adding insult to injury, even the most sophisticated documentation of adaptive value in a current feature gives us no right to assert similar adaptational control over its past states — even admitting the principle of quirky functional shift, and the possibility of strikingly different past usages, with current functions emerging as exaptations. Rather, the principle of spandrels suggests that a high percentage of traits now contributing in important ways to fitness arose for no adaptive reason at all, but rather as automatic side con­sequences of other forces (usually selection on other aspects of the organism to be sure, but with no direct selection on the trait under study). The adap­tationist program cannot provide a full accounting of evolutionary change if a high percentage of traits originated as nonadaptive spandrels.

We must then pose the second question about the relative frequency of spandrels. If rare, they remain conceptually interesting, but minor in actual importance for the evolutionary understanding of particular lineages — the bread and butter of daily practice in our science. My broader case for the high frequency, indeed for the near ubiquity, of spandrels occupies the last section of this chapter, but I raise three points here to set a framework of plausibility for frequencies far too high to ignore.





RELATIONSHIPS TO GEOMETRY AND ARCHITECTURE. As Geoffrey and other formalist thinkers recognized from the inception of evolutionary stud­ies in biology, organisms are integrated entities, not hodge-podges of indepen­dent attributes each dedicated to a separate function. For two major reasons, this evident and venerable notion implies a great importance and high relative frequency for spandrels. First, any change in one part of the body must prop­agate correlated alterations to other parts. Selection may generate the original change for adaptive reasons, but many automatic consequences will probably be spandrels. Second, any adaptive feature of one organ will also express in­herent and ineluctable attributes that must rank as spandrels. Most of these sequelae, although surely more numerous than adaptive aspects of the same feature, will probably remain forever irrelevant to evolutionary success of the lineage. (Bones are made of calcite and apatite for adaptive reasons, but bones are also white because the chemistry of these compounds so dictates. Invisible during life, this spandrel property of whiteness will probably never influence the evolutionary history of the surrounding organism. But evolution can also generate surprises in the same domain. Prior to the evolution of eyes, who would have predicted that the optical transparency of several enzymes and proteins might one day become relevant to their suitability for cooptation as lens crystallins?)

Thus, even the simplest and universal geometries of filling space must gen­erate a host of spandrels to accompany any basically adaptive style of growth or biomechanical form. Moreover, by using criteria of direct historical re­cords (in infrequent but best cases) or inference of genealogical order from cladistic reconstructions based on living species (a strong, if indirect, mode of argument almost always potentially available), we should be able to divide the useful features of organisms into direct adaptations, coopted adaptations with different original uses, and coopted spandrels — with the last category embodying a crucial challenge to strict adaptationist thinking: currently use­ful features with nonadaptive origins. Consider a simple example where the geometric nature of the spandrel can easily be defined, and where we may in­fer nonadaptive origin from the evidence of cladograms. (Examples of this kind could probably be multiplied indefinitely, and for any organism, were biologists more inclined to grant the subject more attention and explicit study):

All snails that grow by coiling a tube around an axis must generate a cylin­drical space, called an umbilicus, along the axis. The umbilicus may be nar­row and entirely filled with calcite (then called a columella). But the space often remains open, especially in land snails. A few species use the open um­bilicus as a brooding chamber to protect their eggs (Lindberg and Dobberten, 1981).

Is the umbilical brooding chamber a coopted spandrel — a space that arose as a nonadaptive, geometric byproduct of winding a tube around an axis? Or did snails initially evolve their spiral coiling as part of an actively selected de­sign centered upon the direct advantages of protected eggs in a cigar-shaped central space? We cannot use the first method of data from actual historical sequences to resolve this question because we do not know whether the first coiled snails brooded their eggs in an umbilical chamber. But the second method of cladistics and comparative anatomy seems decisive in this case, however inferential: the cladogram of gastropods includes thousands of spe­cies, all with umbilical spaces (often filled as a solid columella and there­fore unavailable for brooding) but only a very few with umbilical brooding. Moreover, the umbilical brooders occupy only a few tips on distinct and late-arising twigs of the cladogram, not a central position near the root of the tree. We must therefore conclude — both from geometric logic (ineluctable produc­tion of the umbilicus, given coiling of the shell) and from the distribution of umbilical brooding on the cladogram — that the umbilical space arose as a spandrel and then became coopted for later utility in a few lines of brooders.

In an equally evident example of an automatic side consequence generated as a geometrical necessity, Megaloceros giganteus, the so-called “Irish Elk,” elongated the neural spines of its shoulder vertebrae for an immediately adap­tive reason that seems well documented in fossil evidence, and rigorously val­idated by biomechanical analysis (Lister, 1994). These deer grew the largest antlers in the history of the Cervidae (up to 35 kilograms in weight on a 2 kg skull). Many big herbivorous mammals with heavy heads extend their neural spines to provide an increased area of attachment for enlarged ligamentum nuchae muscles that hold up the head and neck — a problem that probably af­fected Megaloceros more than any other deer.

The elongated spines are clearly adaptive (for internal insertion of larger muscles), but the outward expression of these enlarged bones — a raised area at the shoulders, covered with hair — probably existed as a nonadaptive span­drel at its initial phyletic appearance, an inevitable consequence of the geome­try of physical space. And so this feature would have remained, as the vast majority of spandrels do, until the species's demise — except for a coopted utility that converted the original spandrel into an exaptation in this case. This raised area — literally a patch of skin spanning a space enlarged for inter­nal reasons — became enhanced, altered in shape to a more prominent and lo­calized hump, and festooned with distinctive stripes and colors, all (presum­ably) for coopted utility in mating display. I freely admit that the exaptive potential of such simple bumps and spaces must be limited, and may never exceed the primary adaptation (which originally engendered the feature in question as a spandrel) in evolutionary importance. (I also confess that I love this example largely for humanistic reasons (see Gould, 1996b). Fatty humps and coat colors do not fossilize, and Megaloceros became extinct many thou­sands of years ago. We only know about the hump and its colors because our Cro-Magnon ancestors painted a few of these animals on French and Spanish cave walls — see Figure 11-10.)

When we move from simple tubes and sheets (aspects of universal geome­try, even though evolved modes of growth in particular lineages must elicit the forms) to more complex developmental architectures that record the contingencies of particular lineages (rather than the general geometry of Euclid­ian space), both the range and the number of potential spandrels, and their capacity for future exaptive utility, must broaden enormously. I have already mentioned Darwin's (and Owen's) example of non-fusion in neonatal mam­malian skull sutures (p. 326).

In complex sexual animals, a particularly interesting class of spandrels originates as consequences of a developmental constraint leading both sexes along an initially shared embryological pathway that later branches to differ­entiate a set of homologous structures into the two major facies of a species's sexual dimorphism. In the most widely discussed (literally since Aristotle), and still very much unresolved, case of so-called “male mimicking” genitalia in female spotted hyenas, the peniform clitoris, and the labia majora that fold and fuse in the midline to resemble a scrotal sac, may have originated as span­drels of high testosterone levels that, in female development, correlate with the attainment of a larger adult size than males, and with behavioral domina­tion over males. (We should all remember a lesson from our introductory Bi­ology 1 course: the penis and clitoris, and the scrotal sac and labia majora, are homologous pairs of organs, specialized along divergent paths by disparate hormonal titers in the development of the two sexes.)

This fascinating case remains controversial (see Frank, 1997), and some re­cent information indicates that high levels of androgens may not induce “male-like” features in female development (R. Wrangham, personal com­munication). But the explicit formulation of such a nonadaptationist hypoth­esis, based upon spandrels, after more than 2000 years of unchallenged adaptationist speculation, has certainly sparked the debate and inspired a vast outpouring of research that will eventually resolve the issue. At least we may





11-10. Exaptation of raised area at the shoulders as a hump (with secondary ad­aptation of coloring), presumably significant in sexual selection in Megaloceros. We only were able to learn about this unfossilizable feature of this extinct deer because our Cro-Magnon ancestors painted these animals on cave walls, as here from Cougnac.





be confident that no future researcher of such high status and such empirical expertise will again commit the bald version of the Nietzschian fallacy of con­fusing current utility with historical origin — as did Kruuk (1972), the most eminent student of spotted hyenas, when he argued that he had resolved the adaptive origin of “malemimicking” genitalia by documenting the un­doubted utility of these features in facilitating recognition of previously soli­tary clan members in the “meeting ceremony.”

I wanted to call my popular article (Gould, 1987a) on my favorite human example “tits and clits,” but desisted because readers would have assumed a sexist bias when I really meant to designate male tits, not to denigrate women. (I eventually settled upon the rhythmically catchy, but not quite so pithy, “male nipples and clitoral ripples.”) The male question may be largely facetious, although the issue has evoked substantial and explicit discussion ever since Buff on: why do men grow apparently non-functional nipples? The puzzlement of so many people, including several accomplished scientists, flowed from adaptationist biases that demanded an explanation in utilitarian terms: perhaps males can suckle babies in certain circumstances; or perhaps they once did, and male nipples persist as a vestige? But the probable resolu­tion, based on a quite different (albeit simple) perspective, requires the codi­fication of a concept of nonadaptive spandrels for recognition and under­standing: males probably grow nipples because females need them for an evident purpose, and many aspects of development follow a single pathway. So females grow nipples as adaptations for suckling, and males grow smaller and unused nipples as a spandrel based upon the value of single developmen­tal channels.

The female counterpart, however, has evoked much argument, and im­posed substantial grief upon millions of women during the 20th century: why do most female orgasms emanate from a clitoral, rather than a vaginal (or some other), site? The male biologists who fretted over this question sim­ply assumed that a deeply vaginal site, nearer the region of fertilization, would offer greater selective benefit to the Darwinian summum bonum of enhanced reproductive success — hence the supposed puzzle. In the tragedy heaped upon this error, Sigmund Freud defined the almost anatomically im­possible transition from clitoral to vaginal orgasm as the defining criterion of sexual maturity in women. He even regarded, and so labelled, the persis­tence of perfectly satisfactory and exciting clitoral orgasm as a form of frigid­ity. Under his influence, millions of women with normal sexual responses struggled to meet this impossible criterion of “true” realization — with conse­quences ranging from the sad to the tragic.

But a more probable resolution — if any mystery remains once we shed our adaptationist biases — might identify the clitoral site as a spandrel by the same argument applied to male nipples. The female clitoris is the developmental homolog of the male penis, and the adaptive value of male orgasm seems no more problematical than the biological function of the female breast. The clitoral site of female orgasm need not hold any special adaptive value per se, but may arise as a developmental consequence of selection upon the same or­gan in males.

This argument about the nonadaptive nature of the clitoral site (as ad­vanced by Symons, 1979; and Gould, 1987a) has been widely misunder­stood as a denial of either the adaptive value of female orgasm in general, or even as a claim that female orgasms lack significance in some broader sense. Only a grossly overextended commitment to exclusivity for the simplest form of adaptationist argument could ever have led to such foolish misunderstand­ing. I cannot speak from direct experience of course, but I accept the clear testimony that clitoral orgasm plays a pleasurable and central role in female sexuality and its joys. All these favorable attributes, however, emerge just as clearly and just as easily, whether the clitoral site of orgasm arose as a spandrel or an adaptation. (As a spandrel, the clitoral site would represent the different expression of a male adaptation, just as male nipples may be the spandrels of a female adaptation.) After all, we defined the concept of span­drels largely in terms of their rich potential for exaptive utility (Gould and Vrba, 1982). To state Nietzsche's principle in another way: origin as a spandrel implies no diminution of potential for crucial and joyous exaptive use later on.

As to the important question of a potentially adaptive nature for female or­gasm in general, I have no firm opinion, and certainly feel no hostility to­wards functional hypotheses in conventional Darwinian terms of enhanced reproductive success. (I have only questioned the adaptive interpretation of the specifically clitoral site, since basic developmental anatomy would seem to dictate such a placement for other, and prior, reasons. Alfred Kinsey (1953), a very fine evolutionary entomologist who achieved far greater fame in his “second career” as a sociologist of sexual behavior, upbraided Freud, who had begun his own professional life as a comparative anatomist (with a doctoral thesis on the neurology of amphioxus), for failing to draw the obvious inference from a developmental homology that he knew perfectly well, and from easily available information about the rich innervation of the clito­ris, and the virtual anesthesia of the vaginal canal.

Some common hypotheses for the adaptive nature of female orgasm have not fared well, including the standard argument that muscular contractions during orgasm help to draw sperm down the vaginal canal towards the site of fertilization (see Buss et al., 1998). Other arguments of a more psychological nature, especially the claim that orgasm may have positive value in stimulat­ing pair bonding, make more sense in a too obvious way that always manages to incite my skepticism. In any case, the establishment of an important and potentially exaptive value of female orgasm does not challenge the hypothesis that the clitoral site originated as a nonadaptive spandrel (in Darwinian terms for enhancing reproductive success, not in human terms of female pleasure) of selection upon the homologous organ in males, the penis.





RELATIONSHIP TO COMPLEXITY. As a primary correlation regulating the distribution and importance of spandrels vs. primary adaptations, increasing complexity of an organ must imply a rising relative frequency of nonadaptive side consequences with potential future utility. With greater complexity in number and form of components, cooptable side consequences must rise to exceed, or even to overwhelm, primary adaptations. The chief example in bi­ology may be a unique feature of only one species, but we obviously (and properly) care for legitimate reasons of parochial concern. The human brain may have reached its current size by ordinary adaptive processes keyed to specific benefits of more complex mentalities for our hunter-gatherer ances­tors on African savannahs. But the implicit spandrels in an organ of such complexity must exceed the overt functional reasons for its origin. (Just con­sider the obvious analogy to much less powerful computers. I may buy my home computer only for word processing and keeping the family spread sheet, but the machine, by virtue of its inherent internal complexity, can also perform computational tasks exceeding by orders of magnitude the items of my original intentions — the primary adaptations, if you will — in purchasing the device.)

A failure to appreciate the central role of spandrels, and the general impor­tance of nonadaptation in the origin of evolutionary novelties, has often op­erated as the principal impediment in efforts to construct a proper evolution­ary theory for the biological basis of universal traits in Homo sapiens — or what our vernacular calls “human nature.”

I welcome the acknowledgment of self-proclaimed “evolutionary psycholo­gists” (compared with the greater stress placed by the “sociobiology” of the 1970's on a search for current adaptive value) that many universal traits of human behavior and cognition need not be viewed as current adaptations, but may rather be judged as misfits, or even maladaptations, to the current complexities of human culture. But most evolutionary psychologists have coupled this acknowledgment with a belief that the origins of such features must be sought in their adaptive value to our hunter-gatherer African ances­tors. (Much of the daily practice of current “evolutionary psychology” focuses upon efforts to identify and characterize the EEA (their term), or “environ­ment of evolutionary adaptation,” for the origin of cognitive universals as direct adaptations in the common ancestral population of all modern humans.)

I applaud this use and recognition of the Nietzsche-Darwin principle of discordance between reasons for historical origin and bases of current utility (or disutility). But I also believe that “evolutionary psychology” will remain lim­ited and stymied in its worthy and vital goal — to understand the human mind in evolutionary terms — so long as its practitioners place such unwarranted and effectively exclusive weight upon conventional adaptationist explana­tions for the origin of universal cognitive traits, and fail to recognize the cen­tral role (I would say dominant, but the issue obviously remains open) of con­straints and nonadaptations in the initial construction of the cognitive and emotional modules and attributes that we collectively designate as “human nature.”

A central principle about constraint from each of my two chapters (10 and 11) on the subject would broaden the range of hypotheses and lead to a richer and ultimately more accurate “evolutionary” psychology, both in immediate empirical terms of understanding the human mind, and in conformity with the true depth and range of modern evolutionary theory, rather than invoking an almost caricatured version of adaptationism as the only ground of evolu­tionary explanation for the origin of traits.

1. At a sufficient depth and distance, original adaptations now act primar­ily as historical constraints, and must be so characterized and analyzed (the central theme of Chapter 10). When we recognize a cognitive universal of hu­man mentality as ill-fit to the complexities of modern social life, we do not then achieve an explanation of its human origin in adaptationist terms simply because we can state a good case for its initial phyletic appearance as an ad­aptation. We need to specify the evolutionary distance and the environmental context of initial appearance before we can render any judgment. In general, I would accept the statement that if we can locate the feature's adaptational or­igin in the last common ancestor of Homo sapiens, or even as far back as the common ancestor of the hominid line (after splitting from the lineage of great apes), then we may legitimately argue that this initial adaptive context establishes the “evolutionary meaning” of the feature in our quest to understand its appearance in human phyletic history.

But suppose that the feature had a far more ancient, but still fully adapta­tional, origin in a distant ancestor of very different form and neurological function, and also living in a very different environment — say, in the basal gnathostome fish of early Paleozoic times. Suppose also that this mental at­tribute has persisted ever since as a plesiomorphic aspect of the basic opera­tion of the vertebrate brain. When we then try to explain the evolutionary sig­nificance of this mental mode in contemporary human life — especially when we try to identify its role in quirky and clearly suboptimal characteristics of human reasoning in the modern world — would we wish to claim that an ad­aptational analysis (in recognition of the feature's Darwinian origin in such a distant ancestor) will provide our best understanding? Clearly, we do not so proceed in most evolutionary analyses — and for good reasons discussed at length in Chapter 10 on the evolution of development. Rather, we treat such features predominantly as historical constraints because, as invariant and plesiomorphic traits of our entire clade (not only of all hominids and pri­mates, but also of all mammals and tetrapods), they operate as unchanging constraints upon any subsequent evolution of mental modes, despite their ad­aptational origin in such a distant ancestor of such different form and envi­ronment.

I suspect that many puzzling features of human mentality would be better resolved if we conceptualized them as historical constraints derived from dis­tant adaptational origins. To cite a hypothetical example (that would attract my substantial and favorable wager were I a betting man): I agree with a ma­jor theme of structuralist philosophy and research, as developed most co­gently in our times by Claude Levi-Strauss and his followers, that identifies our tendencies to parse natural variety into pairs of opposed and dichotomous categories as an inherent property of human mental functioning — with male and female, night and day, and culture vs. nature as primary examples. I think that most people would also identify this strong preference as a con­straint with highly unfortunate consequences for human life — not only because we so often construct invalid dichotomous taxonomies in our real world of complex continua, but primarily because we so often impose an­other conceptual module for moral judgment upon our pairings (the Manichean good vs. bad), and then proceed to identify one side of the dichotomy (including ourselves and our preferences) as righteous, and the other side (in­cluding “foreigners” and competitors) as worthy of anathematization or even ripe for burning. (I need hardly add that yet another aspect of human mental­ity, our capacity to devise grisly means of death and torture, and our techno­logical ability to apply such means to large numbers of people in short peri­ods of time, makes our innate preferences for dichotomization particularly dangerous.)

Now I am perfectly willing to believe that our brain's preference for dichotomization arose as a highly adaptive attribute in a very distant and ancient small-brained ancestor that, to enhance its prospects for survival, needed to make limited, quick, and twofold decisions that exhausted the maximal capacity of its judgment in any case: mate or wait, eat or sleep, fight or flee. But, whatever the adaptational basis of origin, dichotomization then persisted throughout the subsequent phylogeny of vertebrates as a historical constraint that became more and more quirky, and more and more limiting, as the brain enlarged into the much more sophisticated instrument of a lin­eage that eventually generated our exalted, but curiously freighted, selves.

2. At the level of immediate reasons for persistence and flourishing of the hunter-gatherer common ancestor of Homo sapiens in Africa, many distinc­tive mental attributes of our species, including major features of “human na­ture” that define our evolutionary success, must have arisen as nonadaptive spandrels (later exapted, in several cases, as vital bases of our current domi­nation), and not as primary adaptations (the central theme of Chapter 11). This conclusion necessarily follows from the previous argument that, at the level of maximal natural complexity represented by the human brain, conse­quential spandrels must, at least in number, overwhelm the primary adapta­tions that generate them. Therefore, in terms of exaptive potential for evolu­tionary futures, the brain includes more cooptable spandrels than primary adaptations. Any “evolutionary psychology” that neglects the nonadaptational origin of many features now useful (or at least used, however dubiously), and that limits the domain of evolutionary inquiry to arguments (of­ten speculative) about initial adaptive causes and benefits, will become more misleading than enlightening in restricting investigation to such a narrow scope of inquiry. We must abandon the largely unconscious bias of an overly strict Darwinian approach that equates all “evolutionary” explanation with adaptationist analysis.





THE UBIQUITY OF SPANDRELS UNDER A HIERARCHICAL CONCEPTION OF EVOLUTIONARY LEVELS AND CAUSALITY. If Darwin's own view of natural selection as a single-level process operating on organisms had pre­vailed, spandrels would still be pervasive in nature and important in evolutionary theory. But the scope of nonadaptive side consequences would then be limited to overt structures, physiologies and behaviors of bodies. That is, spandrels would be altered bits and pieces (often substantial) of organic “stuff,” molded as the propagated effects of primarily adaptational changes wrought by selection upon other parts of the body.

But under the revised and expanded hierarchical theory (Chapter 8), where selection works simultaneously on a nested hierarchy of biological individu­als (genes, cell lineages, organisms, demes, species, clades), the domain of spandrels becomes much larger, and their importance to evolutionary theory expands accordingly, and for an interesting reason that has not been ade­quately addressed in the literature (see Gould and Lloyd, 1999), but will oc­cupy most of the next and last section of this chapter. The expansion of span­drels under a hierarchical theory of selection establishes the most interesting and intricate union between the two central themes of this book — the defense of hierarchical selection (as an extension and alteration of Darwin's single-level organismal theory) on the first leg of the tripod of essential components in Darwinian logic; and the centrality of structural constraint (with non-adaptively originating spandrels as a primary constituent) for a rebalancing of relevant themes, and as a correction to the overly functionalist mechanics of selection on the second leg of the tripod (or branch of the tree — see Fig­ure 1-4).

To epitomize the central argument: under a hierarchical theory of selection, any novelty introduced for any reason (usually adaptational) at any level, must propagate a series of effects to biological individuals at other levels of the hierarchy. Duplication of genetic elements by direct selection at the gene level, for example, propagates redundancies to the organismic level; any or­ganismal adaptation at Darwin's level propagates changes to the encompass­ing species-individual, as expressed in such species traits as population size, geographic range, and coherence among subparts (organisms). These propa­gated effects must be defined and treated as spandrels. As “injections” from another level (where the initiating change probably had an adaptational, or physically automatic, basis), these propagated effects cannot be viewed as adaptations at the level under consideration. Moreover, because these effects exist as true properties at the level under consideration — that is, as actual “stuff” rather than unused potentials of features now operating in different ways — they must be treated as initially nonadaptive “things” or spandrels, rather than as mere potentialities of some hypothetical future utility. There­fore, under a hierarchical model, spandrels include both the architectural side consequences of adaptational changes at the level of their origin, and the large realm of effects propagated to other levels as nonadaptive consequences of changes wrought for directly causal reasons.

This concept of cross-level spandrels neatly explicates a variety of phenom­ena that have long been recognized as both true and essential, but that have remained puzzling or anomalous under the conventional Darwinian rubric of a functionalist, single-leveled theory of selection. For example, our canonical, almost mantra-like, statement about the deleterious nature of most mutations achieves such an evident explanation that the resulting “aha” seems almost humorous in its suddenly obvious character. Each mutation arises for a per­fectly good reason (usually chemical rather than adaptational in this case) at the gene level. But the effects then imposed upon organismal phenotypes must be designated as spandrels — that is, as nonadaptive side consequences expressed at another level. These effects will usually be deleterious, because the organism, as a highly complex, well integrated, and biochemically ef­ficient object, will more often be hindered than helped by a change that arises as an “injection” from elsewhere, established by causes directly operating only in this elsewhere, and not subject to initial scrutiny at the level of injec­tion. For the same reason, and in another mantra, we designate mutations as “random” — not in the mathematical sense of equally likely in all directions, but in the special evolutionary sense (see Eble, 1999) that such mutations originate without reference to the adaptive needs of the organism. When we recognize the phenotypic expression of mutations as cross-level spandrels, this property of “randomness” becomes entirely sensible, and no longer puz­zling as a supposed sign of organic inefficiency.

Gene duplication, and other modes of origin for the repeated elements that constitute such a high percentage of the genomes of complex organisms (and that have been so puzzling under Darwinian assumptions about organisms as “lean and mean” machines honed to optimality by the relentless power of natural selection), represent the most important “playing field” yet identified for the evolutionary importance of cross-level spandrels. (I thank my col­league Jurgen Brosius for helping me to understand and work through the im­plications of this concept — see Brosius and Gould, 1992; Brosius, 1999; and Brosius and Tiedge, 1996.)

In some cases, of course, gene amplication originates as an immediate adaptation at the organismal level, especially when the availability of more gene product provides a selective advantage to the organism. But, more commonly, amplification occurs for causal reasons at the genic level itself, often by the conventional Darwinian mechanism of increased reproductive success, in this case by generating more copies of oneself, and inserting them into various places in one's surrounding totality — that is, in the genome itself. (Such an argument about direct Darwinian selection at the gene level provides the ra­tionale, as previously discussed (p. 693), for the important hypothesis of “selfish DNA” — see Orgel and Crick, 1980; and Doolittle and Sapienza, 1980 for the original publications.) Yet evolutionists have also recognized (see Ohno, 1970 for the classic statement) that these extra copies may strongly impact the evolutionary future of organisms by supplying flexibility for change through their redundancy. But this otherwise sensible argument also seems to raise a central dilemma in causality itself — since flexibility for future change cannot cause the current origin or maintenance of any feature! We can resolve this problem by recognizing augmented copies as nonadaptive (and cross-level) spandrels at the time of their initial expression at the organismic level. Later recruitment and utilization of spandrels represents a perfectly sensible, indeed inevitable, concept under notions of constraint and hi­erarchical selection. I have, of course, and throughout this chapter, referred to such later utilization as exaptation — in this case by the cooptation of initially nonadaptive spandrels.

I have, in the past, objected to the usual terminology of such amplified ele­ments as “junk DNA,” feeling that such a dismissive term could only record an adaptational bias towards viewing such currently “superfluous” stuff as an insult to Darwinian optimality. I wrote (in Brosius and Gould, 1992, p. 10706): “Genes duplicated or amplified by the tens to the thousands . . . have been named in an ambiguous or even derogatory manner (e.g., pseudo-gene or 'junk DNA'). Such names do not reflect the significance of retroposed sequences as large valuable assets for the future evolvability of species; and, as a result, it is more difficult to contemplate their significance, impact, and function.”

But I have changed my mind after reading an insightful commentary by Sydney Brenner (1999) on my 1997 paper about the meaning and significance of spandrels in evolution. Brenner begins by acknowledging the role of adap­tational biases in our misunderstanding of the meaning and significance of amplified DNA:

There is a strong and widely held belief that all organisms are perfect and that everything within them is there for a function. Believers ascribe to the Darwinian natural selection process a fastidious prescience that it cannot possibly have and some go so far as to think that patently useless features of existing organisms are there as investments for the future ... Even today, long after the discovery of repetitive sequences and introns, pointing out that 25% of our genome consists of millions of cop­ies of one boring sequence, fails to move audiences. They are all con­vinced by the argument that if this DNA were totally useless, natural selection would already have removed it. Consequently, it must have a function that still remains to be discovered. Some think that it could even be there for evolution in the future — that is, to allow the creation of new genes. As this was done in the past, they argue, why not in the future?



But Brenner then defends the traditional terminology of junk DNA with an argument (based on the contrast of junk and garbage in vernacular English) that I had not considered, and that now strikes me as wise and useful:

Some years ago I noticed that there are two kinds or rubbish in the world and that most languages have different words to distinguish them. There is the rubbish we keep, which is junk, and the rubbish we throw away, which is garbage. The excess DNA in our genomes is junk, and it is there because it is harmless, as well as being useless, and because the molecular processes generating extra DNA outpace those getting rid of it. Were the extra DNA to become disadvantageous, it would become subject to se­lection, just as junk that takes up too much space, or is beginning to smell, is instantly converted to garbage.



Brenner then ribs my literary and terminological pretensions (and I accept his criticism). But he also finds a resolution to the conceptual puzzles sur­rounding junk DNA in recognizing that such amplified sequences, when they arise causally at the gene level and then get propagated as effects to the organismal level, are nonadaptive spandrels with great potential for later exaptation to utility. Therefore, their designation as junk — that is, as cur­rently useless, but harmless (as opposed to garbage), and replete with poten­tial future value — seems entirely appropriate, and I belatedly embrace this term as a proper implication flowing from the definition and meaning of spandrels:





The paper [Gould, 1997e] has an important message and I strongly urge my readers at least to look at it, even if all the words in it can't be under­stood. I offer this brief summary as a guide.

The term spandrel originates in architecture and is used to describe spaces left over as a consequence of some other design decision, such as the triangles that remain behind when a rectangular wall is pierced by an arched opening. No self-respecting architect would simply leave such spaces, especially in a grand cathedral with a rich patron. Instead they would be decorated, as is the case of the four pendentives under the dome of San Marco in Venice, which are decorated with the four evange­lists. This example is a good one, because the historical sequence of events is known. The spandrels are the consequence of a structural de­sign decision; a by-product of placing a dome on rounded arches; three centuries later, mosaicists decorated these spaces. Thus spandrels are not primary adaptations but, because they can have later uses, they become in Gould's terminology, exaptations.





The Exaptive Pool: The Proper Conceptual Formula

and Ground of Evolvability





RESOLVING THE PARADOX OF EVOLVABILITY AND DEFINING

THE EXAPTIVE POOL





Conventional Darwinian organismal selection adapts creatures to their im­mediate local environments — a process of specialization, usually operating to produce particular contrivances that reduce organismal flexibility for future evolution to radically altered conditions, especially when adaptation leads to simplification and loss of structures, as in extreme, but common, cases of in­ternal parasitism. In a subset of situations — especially emphasized by Dar­win as the potential ground of general “progress” in the history of life (see p. 467) — local adaptation may be achieved by a generalized improvement in biomechanical design that might be construed as promoting future prospects and flexibilities, rather than restricting phyletic options by specialization. But few evolutionists would doubt that organismal selection leads far more often to diminution of future prospects by specializations and losses than to enlargement by general biomechanical improvement. Natural selection in the organismal mode can only construct local adaptations in the here and now. We can all conjure up the conventional image of highly specialized and gor­geously adapted forms revelling in their successes of the moment, but then dying in the fullness of geological time, as marginal generalists parlay their staying power into phyletic persistence. (Natural selection, of course, may also favor such generalists in certain momentary environments, but not for their future prospects.)

And yet, flexibility for future change manifestly exists in differential de­grees among organisms. This flexibility contributes mightily to the longterm macroevolutionary success of lineages, but cannot be directly built or main­tained by ordinary natural selection in the organismal mode. We designate this differential capacity for success and extent of future change by the vague and loosely defined name of “evolvability” — a concept that, until recently, re­mained unpopular among Darwinian biologists by evoking feelings of dis­comfort and confusion. The reasons for this usual distaste flow from the fail­ure of conventional theory to provide a context that could make such a concept intelligible rather than paradoxical. After all, if “evolvability” seems contrary to the general workings of natural selection, and if natural selection represents the fundamental mechanism of evolutionary change in popula­tions and lineages, then how could “evolvability” be defined or characterized as anything other than an accident or a passive residuum? Phenomena with­out direct mechanisms generally do not win much interest or approbation from working scientists.

For example, in their important 1998 article entitled “Evolvability,” Kirschner and Gerhart express both apparent paradoxes attending this cru­cial concept within a strict Darwinian context: the seemingly logical need to impute selective advantages to supraorganismic levels (within a theory com­mitted to the primacy, or even exclusivity, of organismal selection), and the almost unavoidable “feeling” that benefits of evolvability can only accrue to future states (which, in any standard account of causality itself, cannot be in­fluencing the present evolution of beneficial features). Kirschner and Gerhart write (1998, p. 8426): “The proposal that evolvability has been selected in metazoan evolution raises difficulties because it seems to be a trait of lineages or clades rather than individuals. Clade selection is often considered an 'ex­planation of last resort.' Also, evolvability seems to confer future rather than present benefit to the individual.”

But if we follow the expanded Darwinian logic of this book, the para­doxes become only apparent because the theoretical revisions developed herein validate both apparent peculiarities of “evolvability,” thus bringing this crucial concept within the rubric of a revised evolutionary theory. First, selection at higher levels is an important force in evolution — and evolvability can therefore originate directly at the level of its evident advantage. Second, the structuralist validation of exaptation establishes, as a central aspect of evolutionary theory, the future cooptation of features initially evolved for other reasons. Thus, hierarchy and positive constraint — the two primary revisions to the first two components of Darwinian central logic — show their mettle in providing theoretical resolutions for each of the superficially para­doxical aspects of “evolvability,” a concept that evolutionary biologists have lately recognized as vital, but treated so gingerly, or even apologetically, in the absence of a proper theoretical framework for admitting something so evi­dently important among accepted modes of causality and explanation.

Indeed, a remarkable change has been brewing for the last decade or so in evolutionary studies. “Evolvability” has suddenly become a hot topic, even among the most orthodox of modern Darwinians (Dawkins, 1996, for exam­ple). This change has occurred for at least three good reasons listed below, each reflecting one of the major topics of these two chapters on the biology of evolutionary constraint. But I feel, as stated just above, that the subject still languishes for want of a proper theoretical context in revisions and expan­sions of a Darwinian world view that had become too narrow in its focus on organismal adaptation and the sufficiency of known microevolutionary mechanisms to explain all scales of evolutionary change. In this final section, I therefore try to provide a context for evolvability by combining the two cen­tral theoretical reformulations of this book: (1) hierarchical models of selec­tion; and (2) the importance of structuralist approaches to biological form and function, as expressed in concepts of constraint and, especially for eluci­dating this particular topic, in the importance of spandrels as nonadaptively originating side consequences, then available for later cooptation to utility as exaptations.

1. From studies of evo-devo, the discovery of extensive genetic and developmental homology among distantly related phyla, especially the common presence, spatial orientation, and mode of action of Hox genes in bilaterian phyla, has focussed attention upon the flexibility inherent in the great range of interesting, workable, and often realized permutations that can be gener­ated from developmental rules shared by all complex animal phyla. In partic­ular, and as discussed previously, the disproof and subsequent reversal of Lewis's original “bottoms up” hypothesis of sequential addition and differen­tiation of Hox genes in causal concert with the complexification and differ­entiation of arthropod phenotypes, has emphasized the enormous flexibil­ity inherent in broad rules emplaced at the outset, and plesiomorphic among all bilaterian phyla — for the common ancestor of protostomes and deuterostomes already possessed a full complement of Hox genes, as do the most homonomous of living groups, the Onychophora and the Myriapoda (see pp. 1147–1150). Thus, the realized diversity of bilaterians evolved in a “top down” fashion (at least for features regulated by the Hox series) from a com­mon ancestor with a full set of basic components and their rules of action al­ready in place.

The constraints of these rules have provided more flexibility in their fecund channels than limitations through their “forbidden places” — a theme rightly emphasized in the finest book yet written on the relationship of homologously shared and rule-bound developmental architecture to flexibility and evolvability in the phyletic richness of subsequent life (Gerhart and Kirschner, 1997). But the importance of constraint and preexisting opportunity in chan­neling the pathways of change should not be underestimated — for the mes­sage of evo-devo does not proclaim that “all is possible under such flexible rules.” One might, for example, denigrate the importance of constraint in noting that a rod-like element of an ancestral agnathan gill arch exhibited sufficient malleability in form and function to become the tiny, disparately shaped and divergently functioning malleus of the mammalian middle ear. The gill-arch elements may therefore work as general building blocks of unconstraining Pharaonic bricks in the metaphor of my treatment of this sub­ject (pp. 1134–1142). But we must also remember that, absent some skeletal element of appropriate form and position (whatever its capacity for future modification to almost any other shape or function), vertebrates would prob­ably never have evolved jaw bones that could transmute to ear bones — and our lineage (if it had survived at all) might have remained an insignificant component of bottom-dwelling mud-sucking marine faunas, thus precluding, at least for this planet at this time, the evolution of any species with enough cognitive capacity to fret about such issues.

2. From studies of genetic structures and sequences, the astonishingly high relative frequency of multiply repeated elements (with respect to previous assumptions about the nature of genomes), and the multiplicity of ways, from gene duplication to retrotransposition, for generating them, have docu­mented enormous redundancy and combinatorial flexibility within genomes — even if we have designated the objects of this discovery with the disrespect­ful name of “junk DNA” (but see p. 1269 for my favorable reevaluation of this term). Retrotransposons, for example, constitute about 40 percent of mammalian genomes (Kazazian, 2000). The human genome includes about 500,000 truncated versions and some 3000 to 5000 full copies of the LINE-1 long terminal repeat. Chromosome 2 of Arabidopsis includes 239 tandem du­plications involving 593 genes. A larger duplication of almost 2.5 million bases appears on two chromosomes in four large blocks. A long stretch of chromosome 4, including 37 genes, has been duplicated on chromosome 5. Chromosome 2 also contains a region with 75 percent of the mitochondrial genome, reflecting a recent transfer of a substantial block of DNA from an organelle to the nucleus (Meyerowitz, 1999) — quite a “gift” of “play” from the genic to the organismal level!

3. From studies of the properties of populations, communities and interac­tions among evolving entities by mathematical modeling and computer simu­lation. Several researchers have used these methods in attempts to identify the abstract and general conditions that might confer flexibility, persistence, and capacity for change upon an evolving population or group of entities. Most notably, as discussed previously (p. 1210), Kauffman's (1993) claim that suc­cessful systems move towards “adaptation at the edge of chaos” rests upon attention to evolvability as a key ingredient of longterm success. Such systems must be adaptive, but too much (and too precise) a local fitting may freeze a system in transient optimality with insufficient capacity for future change. Too much chaos may prove fatal by excessive and unpredictable fluctuation, both in external environments and internal states. But a capacity to adjust to chaotic situations also confers evolvability. Adaptation at the edge of chaos balances both desiderata of current functionality and potential for future change, or evolvability.

Yet, however much biologists can document and articulate these compo­nents of evolvability, the general concept itself has remained uncomfortable, even paradoxical, because the clear existence of “flexibility for future bene­fit,” and the equally obvious importance of evolvability to the long-term per­sistence and success of lineages, cannot be rendered as a directly causal and explicit outcome of the Darwinian mechanisms that we have viewed as fully sufficient for understanding the causes of evolutionary change. Organismal selection for traits that confer differential reproductive success in the ecologi­cal moment simply cannot generate, in any active or direct manner, a set of features that achieves evolutionary significance only by imparting flexi­bility for change in distant futures. We cannot deny that these features of evolvability deeply “matter” in the history of lineages; but how can benefits for futures arise by any causal process in the here and now? Moreover, and adding insult to anomaly, the major components of evolvability apparently reside in “superfluous” genetic elements, and in supernumerary items of anat­omy, that almost seem to mock our usual concepts of the stark efficiency of selection as a natural arbiter between the immediately useful and the discardable junk. As an example of this discomfort and puzzlement, just con­sider the language of Kazazian's excellent review of mammalian retrotransposons (2000, pp. 1152-1153), as he struggles to grasp and communicate the apparent discordance between current irrelevancy (at the level of neces­sary generation) and future benefits: “Although retrotransposons have been viewed as selfish DNAs that provide no benefit to their host cell, we now know that over evolutionary time they have increased the diversity of the ge­nome through a variety of mechanisms providing it with considerable 'added value.' ... It is clear that LI elements are the master mammalian retro­transposons. Although L1s may be selfish, they are clearly not junk, for they have played a major part in our evolution and the evolution of our genomes.” But the genuine junk of today can be exapted for the triumphs of tomorrow. The spores of penicillin didn't do us much good (and even imposed substan­tial harm in spoiling our foods) until Dr. Fleming made his fortuitous discov­ery of a previously unrecognized, and now eminently lifesaving, property.

As its central theme and purpose, this book proposes a set of expansions and revisions to Darwinian theory that, among other salutary features, can resolve the paradox of evolvability by exposing the issue as a Scheinproblem, or problem of appearance — that is, a spurious appearance within an overly restricted theory presently lacking the language and concepts for granting causal intelligibility to this evidently vital theme in evolutionary studies. The key revisions proposed on each leg of the logical structure that I have called the tripod of essential components in Darwinian theory provide, in their en­semble, an explanation of evolvability in hierarchical and structuralist terms.

1. The expansion of selection to a hierarchical theory of simultaneous operation on Darwinian individuals at several nested levels: Future flexibilities cannot be targets of conventional organismal selection; nor can such an at­tribute enter any calculation of the differential organismal fitness that fuels Darwin's mechanism. But this conclusion does not imply that attributes of evolvability must remain uninvolved as agents in any form of selection — for the most commonly cited components of evolvability can act as positive traits to enhance the fitness of species-individuals in selection at the species level. Just consider the two most widely recognized boosts to evolvability at the species level: the propensity of some species to generate relatively more daughter species, and the resistance to extinction conferred upon some spe­cies by such organismal features as generalized anatomy and wide ecological tolerance. These two properties represent the primary analogs, at the species level, of the two cardinal attributes — birth rates and death rates — that virtu­ally define the fitness of organisms in the calculus of Darwinian benefits for traits that must ultimately express their selective advantages by correlation with enhanced birth or retarded death of organisms. Organismal selection cannot craft propensities for speciation or resistances to extinction in any di­rect way, but these properties act as primary features in the higher-level pro­cess of species selection, and therefore figure prominently and directly in the calculus of selective advantage under hierarchical models.

But a potential problem still remains. Species selection can certainly utilize and maintain these important traits of species-individuals, but species selec­tion cannot always fashion such traits, especially when they emerge into this higher level as spandrels of selection upon organisms — as must occur when emergent fitness at the species level resides in the higher-level expression of organismal traits that can only originate by conventional organismal selec­tion (see Lloyd and Gould, 1993; Gould and Lloyd, 1999 for an analysis of the logic of this issue). For example, in the case cited above, the enhanced re­sistance of a species to extinction emerges as a consequence of such organ­ismal traits as generalized anatomy and broad physiological tolerance.

But when we probe further, and draw the appropriate analogy to the level we understand best, we recognize that ability to utilize, combined with inabil­ity to fashion, represents a norm within Darwinian theory, not a distinctive anomaly provoked by evolvability at the species level. Ordinary natural selec­tion doesn't manufacture its variational raw material either. Darwinians have always understood that their theory's most quirky, most original, and most brilliant intellectual “move” explains how a process that creates nothing di­rectly can, nonetheless, operate on raw material of different origin to become a “creative” force in the construction of novel and useful features. Indeed, I devoted much of Chapter 2 to illustrating how Darwin's contemporaries rarely grasped this intensely paradoxical, but defining, property of natural se­lection's genuine creativity, based only upon its power to enhance or eliminate, but not to craft variation in a direct and dedicated manner. And I pointed out that the isotropy (or undirectedness) of variational raw material acts as a prerequisite for granting natural selection this potentially creative role.

Thus, Darwinians have always argued that mutational raw material must be generated by a process other than organismal selection, and must be “ran­dom” (in the crucial sense of undirected towards adaptive states) with respect to realized pathways of evolutionary change. Traits that confer evolvability upon species-individuals, but arise by selection upon organisms, provide a precise analog at the species level to the classical role of mutation at the organismal level. Because these traits of species evolvability arise by a differ­ent process (organismal selection), unrelated to the selective needs of species, they may emerge at the species level as “random” raw material, potentially utilizable as traits for species selection.

The phenotypic effects of mutations are, in exactly the same manner, span­drels at the organismal level — that is, nonadaptive and automatic manifesta­tions at a higher level of different kinds of causes acting directly at a lower level. The exaptation of a small and beneficial subset of these spandrels virtu­ally defines the process of natural selection. Why else do we so commonly re­fer to the theory of natural selection as an interplay of “chance” (for the spandrels of raw material in mutational variation) and “necessity” (for the locally predictable directions of selection towards adaptation). Similarly, spe­cies selection operates by exapting emergent spandrels from causal processes acting upon organisms.

2. The acknowledgment of structural components as joint causes and spe­cifiers, along with natural selection, for the directions of evolutionary change: (In the most radical version, these structural inputs operate as positive con­straints generated as consequences of features with nonadaptive origins, thus precluding a purely functionalist or adaptationist account for both the ori­gins, and the channels of subsequent change, of organismal traits.) To sum­marize this major claim of the preceding section: if important components of evolvability must emerge as spandrels of natural selection on other features (for they cannot be fashioned as direct products of a process that cannot ex­plicitly make “things” for potential future benefits), and if these spandrels serve as exaptable raw material for higher-level processes of change, then we will need to describe macroevolution at least partly in the language of channeling by historical and structural constraint (often based upon features with nonadaptive origins), and not entirely in conventional functionalist terms of selective modelling to current environments, potentiated by an effectively un­fettered capacity of mutational raw material to provide the wherewithal for evolutionary movement in any immediately adaptive direction.

3. The conventional mechanisms of microevolution cannot, in their extrapolation through geological immensity, fully explain the causes and patterns of evolutionary change at larger scales: I have argued throughout this book that the biological components of nonextrapolation lie within critiques of the first two legs of the tripod — and I have therefore invoked the external “disobedi­ence” of the geological stage to represent this theme as a surrogate from the domain of another relevant subject (particularly for paleontologists like my­self). Similarly, for this case of evolvability, species level selection on the first leg, and nonadaptive spandrels on the second leg, identify the major barriers to explaining evolvability by extrapolated microevolutionary Darwinian pro­cesses.

Above all, and to move forward towards a clear and operational definition of concepts, the crucial subject of evolvability requires a taxonomy for its nu­merous modes, and their strengths and distributions. The key to an inclusive accounting lies in the general notion of usable features (for promoting long-term diversification and success) now unused. What kinds of attributes thus contribute to evolvability? What encourages their production or augments their number (especially since natural selection in the organismal mode can­not craft such features directly)? Who has more of them and why?

Clearly, organisms and populations maintain what we might call a “fund” or “pool” of potential utilities now doing something else, or at least doing no harm. I propose that we designate this ground of evolvability as “The Exaptive Pool,”* and that we try to establish a logical, interesting, and em­pirically workable taxonomy for the various attributes in this fund of exaptable potential. The exaptive pool represents the structural basis of evolvability, the potential vouchsafed to future episodes of selection (at all levels) in a world of strongly polyhedral objects always and ineluctably built with interesting corners and facets that facilitate and channel the directions of evolutionary movement.





THE TAXONOMY OF THE EXAPTIVE POOL





Franklins and Miltons, or inherent potentials vs. available things


The American dime, the smallest and thinnest (but not the least valuable) of our coins, can't purchase much these days, but still functions as legal tender, the primary cause of its manufacture and useful persistence. American dimes have also, starting a few years after his death near the end of World War II, borne a representation of Franklin D. Roosevelt on their recto (“heads”) side. As an unintended consequence of their thinness, American dimes (and no other indigenous coins) also happen to fit snugly into the operative groove on the head of a standard screw — and dimes therefore work very well as adventi­tious screwdrivers. (I strongly suspect that virtually every adult American has used a dime in this well-known supplementary way, just as many of us know how to jimmy a door latch with a credit card.) American dimes are therefore adaptations as money, and exaptations as screwdrivers.

This potential for supplementary use as a screwdriver represents an inher­ent capacity of the dime's size and shape, not a separate and unused entity arising as a side consequence of some other change. The inherent potentials of any object (for uses other than their intended purpose of manufacture) es­tablish a large and important category of attributes in the exaptive pool of any biological individual. I propose that we refer to these inherent (but cur­rently, or at least usually, unexploited) potential functions as “franklins” to honor the most famous exaptation of the American dime. (Indeed, if our cur­rency inflates much further, dimes may become virtually useless as money, and their exaptive role as screwdrivers may achieve a primary status in imme­diate function. When Russia's currency hyper inflated after the collapse of the Soviet Union, I witnessed a remarkable example of this phenomenon. Five-kopeck coins had become truly worthless as currency, but only objects of their size, shape and weight could operate public telephones. Sharp entrepre­neurs therefore stood at telephone booths, offering to sell old five kopeck coins for 100 rubles each — 2000 times their official monetary value, but when ya gotta call, ya gotta call.)

Franklins are not actual but unemployed “things out there.” Franklins are alternative potential functions of objects now being used in another way. In the words of my subtitle, franklins are inherent potentials, not available things. This distinction may seem trivial, inordinately fine as an exercise in logic chopping, or even parodic to hard-nosed scientists committed to the professional ethos of “just give me the facts, and leave linguistic and theoreti­cal niceties to effete humanists who lack the luxury of an objectively empiri­cal subject matter.” But I will attempt to show, in the next two sections, that the distinction between inherent potentials and available things, as the two fundamental categories of the exaptive pool, provides the conceptual key to understanding the importance of spandrels, and for recognizing the strong weight that must be applied to structuralist, and particularly to nonadaptationist, elements in the exaptive pool — thus defining the revisionary power of this concept in evolutionary theory, and exposing the depth of different ex­planations required to understand evolvability vs. ordinary adaptation by natural selection.

I will just mention, for now, that franklins constitute the theoretically untroubling category embodied in the Darwinian notion of quirky functional shift (as discussed on pp. 1218–1229 of this chapter). Franklins capture the important concept so poorly expressed in the old term “preadaptation” — that is, suitability for another function not presently exploited because the feature has been adapted by natural selection for a different utility. When feathers function for enhanced thermoregulation on the arm of a small run­ning dinosaur, their potential aerodynamic benefits are franklins, or inherent but unused potentials. When Michelin's rubber works as an automobile tire, its suitability for manufacturing cheap and durable sandals for poor children in developing countries is a franklin. In short, franklins represent future potentials within structures now adapted to a different utility. When evolution then coopts the structure for actual service in this formerly potential role, the franklin becomes an exaptation. The entire process remains under the control of Darwinian selection and adaptation throughout. Franklins do not vie with current utilities, and they cannot be construed as “things” (whether adaptive or nonadaptive) waiting for a potential place in the adaptive sun. Franklins are the inherent potentials that permit Darwinian pathways, under the con­trol of natural selection leading to adaptation at all times, to undergo quirky and unpredictable shifts from one function to a qualitatively different utility.

The attributes in the second major category of the exaptive pool are, by important contrast, actual entities, pieces of stuff, material things that have be­come parts of biological individuals for a variety of reasons (to be exemplified in the next section), but that have no current use (and also cause no substan­tial harm, thereby avoiding elimination by selection). Items in this second cat­egory of “available things” can originate in several ways — as nonadaptive spandrels (the most important subcategory, I shall argue), as previously useful structures that have become vestigial, or as neutral features fortuitously in­troduced “beneath” the notice of selection.

I propose that we refer to these available but currently unused material or­gans and attributes as “miltons” to honor one of the most famous lines in the history of English poetry. John Milton ended his famous sonnet On His Blindness, written in 1652, by contrasting two styles of service to God: the frenetic activity of evangelists and conquerors and the internal righteousness of people with more limited access to worldly action:





. . . thousands at his bidding speed,

And post o'er land and ocean without rest;

They also serve who only stand and wait.





Miltons, in short, are actual things, presently without function, but holding within their inherent “goodness” the rich seeds of potential future utility. Now, they only stand and wait; tomorrow, they may be exapted as key inno­vations of great evolutionary lineages.

Miltons constitute the radical counterpart to the conventionality of frank­lins within the exaptive pool. Miltons break the exclusivity of the adaptationist program by basing a large component of evolvability not upon the poten­tial of already functional (and adaptive) features to perform in other ways, but rather upon the existence of a substantial array of truly nonadaptive fea­tures — unused things in themselves rather than alternative potentials of fea­tures now functioning in other ways (and regulated by natural selection at all times). If features with truly nonadaptive origins occupy a substantial area in the full domain of evolvability, then we must grant this structuralist (and nonadaptationist) theme a generous and extensive space within the logic and mechanics of evolutionary theory. For this reason, I have argued that span­drels — already the most important category of miltons, but made far more significant by the inclusion, under their rubric, of cross-level effects of fea­tures originating at other levels (see pp. 1286–1294 of this section) — win their central status in revising and expanding evolutionary theory because they represent the primary input of an overtly structuralist and nonadaptationist concept into the central logic of evolutionary causation.





Choosing a Fundamentum Divisionis for taxonomy: an

apparently arcane and linguistic matter that actually embodies a

central scientific decision


Table 11-2 presents my sketchy and preliminary proposal for taxonomy of subcategories in the exaptive pool. I shall retain franklins, or inherent poten­tials, as an integrity for now, not because I doubt that they could be usefully divided into subcategories, but simply because I wish to focus upon miltons, or available things, as the component of the exaptive pool that holds most re­formatory promise within evolutionary theory.

I divide miltons into two major categories according to their different mo­dalities of generation: structurally, as automatic and nonadaptive sequelae or side consequences of changes in other features, or at other levels; and histori­cally, as nonadaptive features not linked by structural or mechanical necessity to another feature of a biological individual, but rather introduced sequen­tially in time by processes that can generate and tolerate such nonadaptive en­tities.

I then divide each of these two subcategories into two further groups. Structural miltons, as necessarily and automatically consequential, are all, and collectively, spandrels. But spandrels come in two different “flavors,” with the second group of cross-level effects (newly so categorized here) repre­senting, in my judgment, the key addition that elevates spandrels to a posi­tion of central importance in evolutionary theory. (I will present my full ar­gument for considering cross-level effects as spandrels in the next section, pp. 1286–1294.) In any case, the first structural group of at-level, or architec­tural, spandrels includes the mechanical and automatic side consequences, deployed throughout the rest of the individual, of any primary change (usu­ally adaptive) evolved by other features of the same individual. When I orig­inally defined the biological concept of spandrels (Gould and Lewontin,

1979), with the pendentives of San Marco as my “holotype,” I described only this group — not for any good or principled reason, but simply because I had not recognized the status of cross-level effects in a hierarchical theory of selec­tion. Obviously, I already regarded this restricted set of at-level architectural byproducts as potentially significant in evolution. But the inclusion of cross-level effects as a second category moves the concept of spandrels from an edge of interest to a center of potential importance in evolutionary theory.

The second grouping of cross-level, or propagated, spandrels includes the expressed effects upon biological individuals of changes introduced for a definite reason (whether adaptational or not) at a different initiating level. I include such cross-level effects under the rubric of miltonic spandrels, rather than franklinian potentialities (as they have usually, if unconsciously, been re­garded, when conceptualized at all), because, like the architectural sequelae of my at-level group, they are actual, initially unused, nonadaptive things that also arise as side consequences — even though the side consequence in this sec­ond group of cross-level spandrels are propagated effects to other levels (of­ten with no expression at the level of origin for the primary change that gen­erated them), whereas the side consequences in the first group of at-level spandrels are immediate mechanical correlates of a primary change in the same individual, and therefore easier to spot and define.

I then divide the second subcategory of historical miltons into two group­ings of markedly different status:

1. Features that lose an original utility without gaining a new function. In a first group of “unemployments” or “manumissions,” previously utilized fea­tures become liberated from functional or selective control, and gain freedom to become exapted for other uses. Currently nonadaptive as a historical result of their altered status, they fall out of selective control and into the exaptive pool as actual items that must now “stand and wait,” but might serve again in an altered evolutionary future.

We have generally granted little evolutionary potential to such vestigial unemployments because relatively quick reduction and loss — as in the stan­dard example of eyeless cavefishes — seems to follow as an inevitable injury of degeneration added to the initial insult of unemployment. But such manu­mitted miltons may be quite common, particularly at the gene level (where the process has achieved greater recognition). Many multiply repeated evolu­tionary phenomena — the deletion of larval forms in the evolution of direct development, or the shedding of adult stages in progenetic lineages, for exam­ple — must leave a substantial number of genes in such an “unemployed” state. Yet, as we also recognize, full unemployment may occur only rarely be­cause most genes function in more than one way. (This fact, however, should be regarded as salutary for future exaptive potentials in keeping partially “unemployed” genes in an active state of resistance to true operational discombobulation by accumulation of neutral mutations.)

In the most fascinating confirmation of our literature (see p. 688 for more details in a different context), Hendriks et al. (1987) sequenced the alphaA crystallin gene in the blind mole rat Spalax ehrenbergi (which still grows a lens in its vestigial eye, although the lens's irregular shape cannot focus an image, and the eye remains buried under skin and hair in any case). They found that the blind mole rat has accumulated mutational changes in alphaA crystallin at a rate far higher than that observed in nine other rodents — but still (to emphasize the intended point) at only 20 percent of the characteristic rate for truly neutral pseudogenes. The authors conclude that although the alphaA crystallin gene emplaces substantial gene product into a nonoperational lens (at least for vision), the gene must still serve some function, sup­ported by stabilizing selection, to resist the full neutral rate of change.

In another context on p. 1245, I noted that, although the alphaA crystallin gene is more specialized for generating lens protein than its paralog alphaB crystallin, its product still appears in other organs in some mammalian spe­cies. Moreover, the nonseeing eye of blind mole rats may continue to function in other ways. Haim et al. (1983) show that blind mole rats still perceive light (and not by the obvious nonvisual route of correlates to temperature) in regu­lating their circadian clocks to photoperiod. Hendriks et al. (1987) argue that melatonin, secreted by the equally nonvisual retina, may act as a prime circa­dian regulator — and they therefore suggest that the developmental pathway leading to the eye and its lens, including the action of alphaA crystallin, may be adaptively preserved because the eye also performs essential nonvisual functions.

2. Features introduced beneath selection's scrutiny. In the second group of “insinuations,” nonadaptive features may enter the exaptive pool by neutral drift. Just as we have unfairly discounted the role of manumitted miltons, we have probably underestimated the relative frequency of insinuated miltons, although for a different reason. We have regarded neutral changes as both pe­ripheral and rare (largely restricted to tiny populations on the verge of elimi­nation in any case) because we have granted too much power to selective control — thus permitting our orthodoxy to become self-fulfilling by circular argument. But the frequency of insinuated miltons may actually be quite high, especially given the inevitability of their substantial introduction via founder effects.

In a fascinating recent example (Tsutsui et al., 2000; Queller, 2000), the Argentine ant Linepithema humile, “a superb invader of non-native habitats” (Queller, 2000, p. 519), has become firmly established in Mediterranean envi­ronments of California, much to the detriment of several native species and to the distress of humans. Queller notes (op. cit.): “We rarely understand why invading species succeed, although a common advantage is that they leave their predators, parasites and pathogens behind. Although this explanation could apply to Argentine ants, it seems that the most serious enemies left be­hind were the warring clans of its own species.”

In Argentina, ants of different colonies fight, and these antagonisms, and the resulting elimination of many colonies, keep the entire species at relatively low population densities, thus leading to an ecosystem that includes many other equally successful ant species. But, in California, Linepithema humile does not fragment into mutually antagonistic colonies, but lives as a single aggregate. Queller states (op. cit.): “They form a vast supercolony within which there is little aggression and extensive interchange of both workers and queens. Such ants are called unicolonial because a whole population effec­tively becomes one colony.” The Californian success of Linepithema humile does not arise from their prowess as fighting individuals (for these relatively small ants do not seem especially gifted as gladiators in combat by the myrmecine equivalent of mano a mano), but from the sheer power of their num­bers — “because of their ability to rapidly recruit legions of troops from their network of nests. So peace with flanking nests generates advantages in com­petition with other species” (Queller, 2000, p. 519).

Fighting among different colonies in native Argentina depends upon the ants's ability to recognize degrees of genetic relationship as assessed by differ­ences at seven microsatellite loci of nuclear DNA. (Interestingly, in another form of exaptation — a cross-level spandrel in this instance — the usefulness of these markers presumably arises from the rapid and substantial variability thus imparted among populations, and flowing upwards as an effect from the neutral status of most mutations in these microsatellites.) Thus, in Argentina, ants tolerate conspecifics of closely related colonies and fight with genealogi­cally more distant conspecifics in colonies of greater genetic disparity.

However, and unsurprisingly, the ancestors of the California invaders passed through a genetic bottleneck in their initially small population, proba­bly derived from a single native colony. The California ants lost about two-thirds of the genetic variability at microsatellite loci. “So all of the ants are ge­netically alike, and those applying the old similarity-tolerance rule could be fooled into accepting everyone as kin” (Queller, 2000, p. 519). Thus, as an example of an insinuated milton (a feature introduced nonadaptatively by neutral drift) that has been exapted for marked, if transient, utility, the suc­cess of Linepithema humile in California seems to rest upon a loss of genetic variability that induced the ants to form a single supercolony operating as a military phalanx (to continue the dubious tradition of anthropomorphic description for behaviors of social insects) of remarkable power and efficiency. Queller notes (p. 5190): “Paradoxically, the ecological success of the intro­duced populations stems not from adaptation but from the loss of an adapta­tion — colony recognition — due to genetic drift.” But, then, if we recognized the hierarchical nature of selection, and repressed our adaptationist biases, this situation might not appear so paradoxical, and we might even search ex­plicitly, encouraged by a conceptual reform and expectation, for phenomena that may be very common in nature, but that elude our notice because we find them anomalous, and do not recognize their existence until they stare us in the face.

Finally, this case also suggests an interesting flip-side of potential longterm disadvantages for such transient success — a near necessity in our hierarchical world of potentially conflicting levels, lest victory at one position propagate throughout the system to full and permanent triumph. (The scientifically as­tute Tennyson may have experienced a more universal insight than we usually acknowledge in penning his famous line in Morte d'Arthur (1842): “The old order changeth, yielding place to new . . . lest one good custom should cor­rupt the world.”) If reduced conflict builds supercolonies of such competitive success, why does the same species live so differently, and so much more mod­estly, in its native Argentinian abode?

Queller (2000, p. 520) presents the interesting and cogent explanation that, by losing their capacity to identify degrees of kinship, the ants “can­not improve or even sustain their cooperative behavior. Without relatedness, adaptive modifications of cooperative worker behavior cannot be favored and maladaptive ones cannot be disfavored.” Queller (op. cit.) therefore con­cludes that the randomly established feature (the miltonic insinuation) be­hind transient triumph must also spell eventual doom: “Random drift will become important again, this time because of the absence of any opposing force rather than a small population size. The ants are like a casino gam­bler who is lucky once but cannot quit: chance got them their stake, but over the long run it can only lead to ruin.” Thus, either the California ants will eventually restore their genetic variability, split into fighting colonies, and become restricted to smaller overall populations with greater staying power; or they will suffer “the lingering death of decay by drift” (p. 520). Tsutsui et al. (2000) propose what, to most people, would sound like an absurd and counterintuitive strategy for control, although the suggestion clearly makes theoretical (but perhaps not practical) sense to anyone schooled in the intrica­cies of evolutionary theory: introduce more ants with substantial variation at those microsatellite loci, thus encouraging self-regulation by the reinitiation of conflict!

Thus, in summarizing the categories in my proposed taxonomy of the exaptive pool, the currently unused but eminently usable features that build the ground of differential evolvability fall into two groups of inherent poten­tials (franklins) and available things (miltons). Miltons, in turn, include three distinct groupings ordered by different sources of origin. The exaptive pool therefore contains:





• Potentials (franklins)

• Consequences (miltons arising as spandrels)

• Manumissions (miltons arising by unemployment)

• Insinuations (miltons arising by random drift)





All taxonomies — thus embodying the richness of fascination of systematics as a scientific subject (Gould, 2000c) — mix aspects of nature's objective order with human preferences for utility or intelligibility. Even if we allow that these four categories exist “out there” in nature — and even I, although I developed this scheme, would not go so far in trying to craft a naturalistic defense, for I recognize that the objective items of the exaptive pool could be parsed in other ways — our decisions about their ranking and secondary ordering require a choice among several logically legitimate alternatives. All taxonomies base such choices on the designation of a fundamentum divisionis, or basis of primary ordering. The differences among alternative fundamenta reflect the theories we favor as most useful in understanding and explaining the phenomena encompassed by the taxonomy. (Thus, as Ernst Mayr has so forcefully argued throughout his career, taxonomies are theories about the basis of order, not boring and neutral hatracks, pigeonholes or stamp albums for accommodating the objective and uniquely arranged items of nature.)

For the exaptive pool, I can imagine three fairly obvious candidates for fundamenta (and I am sure that other possibilities have eluded me). My choice of franklins vs. miltons reflects my convictions and arguments about the most appropriate theoretical context for understanding the evolutionary meaning and importance of the exaptive pool.

First, suppose I were working within a more orthodox context that as­sumed effective control over evolution by natural selection. Suppose further that, within this context, I still appreciated the importance of specifying the currently unused attributes of organisms that might contribute to future suc­cess. From such a standpoint, I would probably be tempted to choose a fundamentum that drew a primary distinction between the ineluctable un­used attributes that arise even when natural selection works in its “leanest and meanest” mode of optimization, and a second groups of unused attrib­utes that arise either from the cessation or the weakness (or at least the non-exclusivity) of natural selection. In such a taxonomic system, I would place all franklins together with all miltonic spandrels in my first category of in­eluctable attributes of pure selection (inherent potentials of features opti­mized by selection for other functions, and inevitable side consequences of similarly optimizing selection). I would then devote my second category to the other two groupings of miltons — manumissions and insinuations — aris­ing as historical results of selection's relinquished control: features falling out of its purview for the first group, and features insinuated beneath its notice in the second group.

In a second fundamentum that might also follow from stronger selectionist commitments, I might decide to make a primary division between attributes that originated either as direct adaptations or as inherencies of direct adapta­tions for the first group, and attributes with truly nonadaptive origins for a second group. In this case, I would place miltonic manumissions and frank­lins in the first category (as adaptations that become unemployed, and as ad­ditional potentials of features that arose as direct adaptations). I would then unite miltonic spandrels and insinuations into a second category of attributes originating as nonadaptations — spandrels as features that are nonadaptive in their own isolated selves (whatever the adaptive status of other features that generated them as side consequences), and insinuations as nonadaptive fea­tures that originated beneath the notice and malleability of selection.

I have chosen a quite different third alternative — inherent potentials (franklins) vs. available things (miltons) — because I wish to emphasize the structuralist and nonadaptionist components of evolutionary theory that have, in Darwinian traditions, been downplayed or ignored. This funda­mentum stresses the primary difference between consequences of purely adaptationist mechanisms applied to directly adaptive features (the franklins, or inherent potentials, that, ever since Darwin's excellent arguments against Mivart, have been recognized as the basis of quirky functional shift in unpre­dictable evolutionary sequences remaining entirely under selectionist con­trol); and the extensive and influential set of material features that actually “stand and wait” by themselves as nonadaptive attributes (not as additional but now only potential uses of present adaptations). In other words, I choose this fundamentum because miltons (and not franklins) pose a genuine chal­lenge to the exclusivity of adaptationist mechanisms. Franklins enlarge the scope and sophistication of selectionist argument, adding a genuine flavor of formalist limitation and potentiation to an otherwise naively functionalist theory based only upon organic accommodation to selective pressures of an external environment. But miltons emplace a genuinely nonadaptionist com­ponent into the heart of evolutionary explanation — for if many features origi­nate as nonadaptations, and if nonadaptations, as material items of miltonic “stuff,” stand and wait while occupying a substantial percentage of the exaptive pool, then evolutionary explanations for both the origin of novelties, and for the differential capacity of lineages to enjoy future phyletic expansion and success, will require a revised and expanded version of Darwinism, enriched by nonselectionist themes of a formalist and structuralist research program. I therefore choose my fundamentum as the best taxonomic device for explor­ing the role of nonadaptation and structural constraint in the exaptive pool of evolvability.





Cross-level effects as Miltonic spandrels, not Franklinian

potentials: the nub of integration and radical importance


As one of its most interesting and potentially reformatory implications, the hierarchical expansion of selectionist theory introduces an extensive array of features into the exaptive pool (and upon the consciousness of evolutionary biologists) as effects propagated to other levels by features that arise for directly causal reasons at a focal level. (One need not challenge the conven­tional view that most direct reasons at focal levels will be selectionist and adaptational — for the propagated effects may still assume a different and non-adaptive status.) What shall we call such effects that only become manifest at other levels and may be truly invisible at the focal level of their generation as consequences? Shall we interpret them as franklins, or inherent and presently unexploited utilities of features originating for other functions — with their only difference from more conventional franklins (flight capacities of thermoregulatory feathers) resting upon the fact that they happen to reside in biological individuals at levels other than the level of the feature that generated them?

I do not think that such cross-level effects can be interpreted as franklins, or mere potentials. Rather, cross-level effects are available things, albeit avail­able only to biological individuals at other levels. Cross-level effects are there­fore miltons, not franklins. Franklins are potentials, not things. As such, franklins can only be recruited sequentially in time from the primary adapta­tions in which they inhere as alternative utilities (feathers for flight following feathers for thermoregulation to cite the canonical example once again). (If feathers performed both functions from the start — a perfectly plausible sce­nario, of course — then we would never have designated their aerodynamic role as a franklin, for this function would have been part of their adaptive ex­pression ab initio.) But cross-level effects, as miltonic things standing and waiting in the exaptive pool, become available as separately cooptable attrib­utes right from their origin. They can therefore be utilized (by exaptation at their different level) simultaneously with the continuing primary adaptive function of the generating feature at its focal level of origin.

For example, the duplicated gene that arose by gene level selection, achiev­ing an adaptive advantage thereby at the genic level (by definition, and through its plurifaction), may be simultaneously exapted at the organismal level by undergoing a mutational change (only now of potential benefit to the organism as a consequence of the gene's redundancy), and contributing thereby to a new organismal function. Similarly, the organismal form that adapted to its immediate environment by evolving a lecithotrophic bottom-dwelling larva from a planktotrophic ancestor, may simultaneously impart an exaptive effect to its species by enhancing the speciation rate via the altered demic structure of isolated subpopulations that no longer experience the gene flow previously potentiated by floating planktonic larvae. I am not, by the way, inventing these cases as personal speculations. Each represents the most widely discussed potential example of cross-level exaptation for its pair of levels.

A recent example (Podos, 2001; Ryan, 2001) illustrates the range and probable ubiquity of simultaneous emplacement of spandrels to other levels as consequences of primary adaptations at a focal level. In the best known case of Darwin's finches, Podos (2001) shows that ordinary adaptation of bill sizes and shapes in response to climatic changes and competition with other species (as so superbly documented in the continuing work of the Grants and others — 1986 for an early summary, for example) imposes automatic conse­quences upon the form, style, and range of the resulting song, because “two functional systems — that used for feeding and that used for singing — share a common morphology, the beak” (Podos, 2001, p. 186). Sharper and nar­rower beaks permit wider ranges and precision of song, whereas heavier and blunter beaks impose greater “constraint” (Podos's term) upon potentials and specificities of resulting vocal production. Since songs function as powerful premating isolating mechanisms, the automatic divergence of song, arising as a side-consequence of ordinary adaptation of bills in feeding, and the differ­ent degrees of distinctiveness attached to specific forms of the bill, may have profound consequences in a resulting (and ultimately highly exaptive) differ­ential capacity for speciation among different subclades of this classic group (based upon varying capacities of the resulting song to act as an effective sig­nal for mate recognition). Ryan's commentary acknowledges Podos's infer­ence about exaptive effects on speciation rate as necessarily conjectural for now, but as the most interesting larger implication of this important study.

This property of simultaneous utilization carries two important implications for the status of cross-level effects. First, cross-level effects are thereby identified as things rather than potentials — that is, as miltons rather than franklins. (Differential variation in range of song among subclades is a “thing” that may impose emergent fitness at the species level at the same time as its generating adaptations in the form of the bill operate in their ordinary Darwinian manner at the organismal level.) Second, cross-level effects, as things, generate a potentially radical challenge to conventional Darwinian concepts. Unused potentials, as argued several times previously, remain fully within the adaptationist program as possible future uses of features that arose as adaptations and will always be adaptations (albeit for a different function in the future). But unused things begin as nonadaptations right at their origin (whatever their future importance as exaptations) — and the demonstration of their high relative frequency in the exaptive pool, and of their importance to the evolutionary history of many lineages, would introduce a significant nonadaptationist element into evolutionary theory.

So if we agree that cross-level effects are miltonic things and not franklinian potentials, into what category of miltons (see Table 11-2) do they fall? If the previous components of this argument prove acceptable, then this final question enjoys a simple and unambiguous resolution: they are spandrels. The key property of spandrels lies in their automatically consequential char­acter as things necessarily enjoined by other changes. Cross-level effects fit this definition in all ways, for they arise in concert with the primary change, and as a necessary consequence thereof. But they do manifest an interestingly different property from such conventional at-level spandrels as the pendentives of San Marco or the cylindrical space that can be exapted as a brooding chamber at the center of a gastropod shell: they express themselves in a bio­logical individual at a different level from the individual bearing the feature that generated the effect.

As stated before, and as the heart of my argument, I believe that the desig­nation of cross-level effects as a second class of spandrels greatly increases the range and importance of this concept — for cross-level spandrels are probably far more common, and of far more frequent importance in potentiating the future direction of evolutionary lineages, than the at-level spandrels that pro­voked the initial formulation of this concept. As an almost naively evident de­fense of this claim, I would point out that more cross-levels exist than focal levels (obviously, as focal levels must be singular!), so cross-level spandrels have more “places to go” than at-level spandrels. Moreover, any cross-level attribute holds greater potential, prima facie, for manifestation as a quirky and oddly nonadaptive feature — for anything arising at one level and injected into another must enter its new domain adventitiously and without reference to the norms and needs of its adopted “home”; whereas an at-level spandrel can only be tolerated if it meshes reasonably well with a design already estab­lished for its kind of entity.

These attributes of cross-level spandrels embody their importance in revis­ing our usual understanding of evolution, particularly at the macroevolutionary level of the species-individual. As argued above, at-level spandrels must be nearly neutral (or at least not too burdensome) because they “come with the territory” and must immediately integrate themselves as parts of the larger structure built at their level — for at-level spandrels share the same kind of form, and are made of the same sorts of materials, as the primary adapta­tions themselves. If pendentives made buildings collapse, or doubled their cost without compromising their mechanical function, then architects would not choose the designs that generate them as necessary consequences of oth­erwise favorable properties.

But cross-level spandrels, especially when injected upwards into more slowly cycling biological individuals at higher levels, can establish themselves more easily, and beyond any screening power of the higher-level individ­ual, by pressure of numerous introductions within single generations of the slowly-cycling higher-level individual. I have been emphasizing the future exaptive potential of nonadaptive spandrels, but nonadaptive features can also work in an opposite manner, becoming detrimental (truly inadaptive) to their bearers — a fate that probably befalls at-level spandrels only rarely (be­cause inadaptive effects will generally preclude their introduction in the first place), but that may represent a common outcome of cross-level spandrels in­jected into higher-level individuals, and not readily suppressed, at least ini­tially, because they can become rooted before any episode of generational cycling reveals their disutility to the higher-level individual.

The claims of the last paragraph may seem arcane and distant (in my ab­stract formulation) from empirical reality. But this phenomenon has long been recognized at the species level, even though evolutionary biology previ­ously lacked the conceptual apparatus to offer a general explanation. We all acknowledge that many organismal adaptations impose strongly negative consequences upon the geological longevity of their lineage. Any highly complex, metabolically expensive, and intensely specialized adaptation (the peacock's tail, or virtually any elaborate contrivance of runaway sexual selec­tion); any alteration, especially involving the loss and simplification of com­plex ancestral structures, that adapts an organism to a transient and highly specialized environment (the “degenerate” parasite utterly dependent on a unique and unusual host); must strongly compromise the geological potential of a subclade bearing its autapomorphy, relative to a sister subclade retaining an ancestral and generalized morphology and ecology. In fact, any feature — and they must be legion — that provides adaptive benefits at the organismal level, but that simultaneously injects such “negative” spandrels into the en­compassing species-individual (either suppressing its rate of speciation or de­creasing its geological longevity thereby), will be inadaptive at the higher level, but unpreventable by insertion before the species-individual can “no­tice” and reject the feature.

This pairing of organismal adaptation with injected spandrels that prove inadaptive to the encompassing species-individual sets the proper conceptual context, under the hierarchical theory of selection, for what our literature has long called, in an ambiguous and merely descriptive way, the “opportunism” of evolution. “Opportunism,” like “preadaptation,” should be recognized as an odd and inappropriately anthropocentric term, designating one subtype in the large and general category of features established for good causal reasons at one level that then impose effects at other times, or upon other levels, either positively (as in “preadaptation”) or negatively (as in “opportunism” for im­mediate advantages, leading to extinction in the long run). Moreover, al­though the term has been fading from use of late, all textbooks of evolution used to include an explicit section on a phenomenon called “overspecialization” — another nonsense phrase devised to treat, when theory lacked the proper concepts, the important observation that many organismal adapta­tions impose inadaptive effects as spandrels upon the encompassing species-individual. What in this pairing could possibly be called “overspecialization” with any justification? The organism becomes adaptively specialized to its own immediate benefit, and the species suffers as a nonadaptive (ultimately inadaptive) side consequence of spandrels representing the adaptation's ex­pression at the species level.*

But I don't want to leave the impression that upwardly-injected cross-level spandrels always spell dissolution, or even doom, at the higher level — and that the species-level, in particular, suffers from this phenomenon, even to the point of becoming a weakened or ineffective locus of evolution thereby (for such a conclusion would greatly compromise the hierarchical theory itself by an argument akin to Fisher's rejected claim (see pp. 644–652) for the logical ineluctability, but practical insignificance, of species selection). Two related arguments reinforce the evolutionary importance of cross-level spandrels, while also reaffirming the power of the species-individual as a biological agent in evolution.

1. We must not view upwardly cascading effects as uniquely detrimental for species, but generally neutral or even positive at other levels. I suspect, rather, that a majority of upwardly cascading effects will be negative at any higher level of expression. Indeed, as argued previously, we have long recog­nized this phenomenon as a fundamental property of Darwinism (though, again, we have lacked the conceptual apparatus for explaining the results in these appropriate terms). The phenotypic expressions of mutations are span­drels at the organismal level, and we have long recognized the vast majority as deleterious for the organism. But we do not regard this inevitable property (of anything injected adventitiously into a different level) as globally detri­mental to organisms. Populations of organisms are large enough, and the generational cycling time of organisms short enough, to tolerate a substantial load of general disadvantage in exchange for the occasional opportunity thereby achieved in encountering a favorable spandrel that can then be exapted in the canonical organismal process of natural selection. (This phe­nomenon gains its extreme expression in bacterial evolution, where the rarity of favorable mutants hardly curtails rapid evolution because populations are so large, and generations so short, that highly infrequent exaptable effects oc­cur often enough to drive substantial evolutionary change by sheer brevity of the waiting time between favorable injections, even in the absence of any mechanism of recombination to spread the benefits among individuals.)

Thus, the organismal level can usually well afford this carnage of generally deleterious mutational effects in order to win its fuel of positive variants for natural selection. Indeed, Darwin's world offers the organism no other choice — for natural selection makes nothing directly and can only operate cre­atively in the generation of evolutionary change if some other process sup­plies enough undirected variation to power its odd mode of negative con­struction by elimination. One might even “applaud” this inevitable property of cross-level spandrels as “just the thing” that natural selection needs to be­come nature's potent driver of evolution despite its weakness, its dependen­cies, and its peculiar style of operation. Three interrelated facts establish and undergird natural selection's capacity to power organismal evolution in the face of these limitations: (1) natural selection requires “random” fuel undi­rected towards adaptive states (lest such an internal force for automatic or­ganic good overwhelm the weak power of selection to produce similar results in a characteristically slow, gradual and roundabout way); (2) the fuel sup­plied by phenotypic effects of mutation expresses itself as cross-level span­drels injected from the gene level into organismal phenotypes; and (3) cross-level spandrels manifest the required property of noncorrelation with benefits at their new level of injection. Would nature be Darwinian at all, absent these interesting properties of cross-level spandrels that must supply the fuel of nat­ural selection — thus establishing the category of “chance” in the duality of “chance” (effects of cross-level spandrels manifested as mutational pheno­types) and “necessity” (direct action of natural selection for adaptation to lo­cal environments) that we generally cite as an epitome of the Darwinian mechanism and worldview? If we just remember that the phenotypic expres­sions of mutations are cross-level spandrels, we will hold an important key for unlocking the curiosities of Darwinism.

2. I don't wish to imply that species-individuals can only be weakened, given their generally small population sizes within their clades, and their slow cycling times, by the nonadaptive (and perhaps usually inadaptive) char­acter of most effects that supply a component of emergent fitness to species selection (Gould and Lloyd, 1999), and that arise as cross-level spandrels injected upwardly from the organismal level below. On the contrary, al­though species may often suffer (in terms of their ability to overcome in-adaptive spandrels) by their small population numbers and slow cycling times — whereas organisms vanquish this impediment by large populations and quick cycling — species also, and in “trade-off,” obtain a tremendous “leg up” over the organismal level by expressing an inherent “allometric” property (see Gould and Lloyd, 1999 for this extension of allometry) possessed by virtue of their sizes and cyclings, but absent in organisms for equally inherent reasons of their own constitution. As argued at length in Chapter 8, organ­isms maintain their biological individuality as discrete entities by strategies of intricate and precise functional interrelationships among constituent parts, and by maintenance of internal and external boundaries (immune systems and skins) to exclude the subparts of other individuals from their geographic space. Thus, and most characteristically, if not uniquely, the organism main­tains its integrity by rigorous policing, and by active suppression of differen­tial proliferation among its subparts, a result that could otherwise follow from positive selection upon the individuals of lower levels within the organ­ism itself (especially upon cell lineages, with the failure of such organismal policing leading to the result that we call cancer).

Thus, organisms sacrifice the benefits of including more upwardly cascad­ing effects as components of their exaptive pool because they work so hard to preserve their distinctive style of individuality by suppressing the churning of lower levels of selection within their bodies. But, by important contrast, spe­cies construct their equally powerful integrity and discreteness by different means that do not require such suppression of upwardly cascading effects. Species maintain their boundaries primarily by reproductive isolation of their subparts (the organisms that constitute their populations) from subparts of other species-individuals. By permitting their subparts to reproduce only with each other, and not with subparts of other species-individuals, a species main­tains its integrity, and constructs its boundary, with just as much clarity and efficiency as organisms can muster by different strategies of functional inte­gration among organs and active exclusion of invaders. This different, but equally efficient, modality of species does not include the suppression of lower level selection as a consequence. Therefore, species remain open, as or­ganisms do not, to experiencing a full and rich range of cross-level spandrels, injected as consequences of selection acting on lower-level individuals (pri­marily upon organisms) within their boundaries.

Now — and here's the rub — we have generally viewed this openness of spe­cies as a negative sign of impotence at this higher level of biological organiza­tion. For, reasoning from our parochial perspective as organisms — and falsely supposing that organismal ways must be universally best ways — we have viewed the species's nonsuppression of upwardly cascading spandrels as a mark of its failings as a potential unit of selection. But perhaps we should re­verse this perspective and learn to respect the distinct allometric properties of species individuality as potential strengths for a different mode of selection — with the higher frequency of cross-level spandrels viewed as a source of rich potential denied to organisms, rather than as a mark of inefficiency imposed upon species.

The species-individual, as a Darwinian interactor in selection at its own level, operates largely with cross-level exaptations arising from unsuppressed evolution of subparts (primarily organisms) at lower levels within itself. Such nonsuppression acts as a source of evolutionary potential by permitting spe­cies to draw upon a wider pool of features than organisms can access.

By not suppressing this evolutionary churning from within, the species-individual gains enormous flexibility in remaining open to help from below, expressed as exaptive effects that confer emergent fitness. Rather than view­ing this nonsuppression of aid from other levels, with the accompanying fail­ure to build many active adaptations at its own level, as a sign of wimpy weakness for the species — construed as a “poor organism” in the implication of most traditional thought — we should rather interpret these allometrically driven properties as cardinal strengths, and recognize the species as a “rich-but-different” Darwinian individual. The species, in this view, acts as a shel­ter or arbor that holds itself fast by active utilization of the properties that build its well-defined individuality. By fostering internal change, and thereby gaining a large supply of upwardly cascading exaptive effects, species use the features of all contained lower-level individuals through the manifestation of their effects on the shelter itself. The species, through its own distinctive fea­tures of individuality, and requiring neither indulgence nor apologia from hu­man understanding, will continue to operate as a powerful agent in Darwin's world whether or not we parochial organisms, limited by our visceral feelings and traditions of language, choose to expand our view and recognize the sources of evolutionary potency at distant scales of nature's hierarchy.

In conclusion, and to reiterate my rationale for placing so much emphasis on cross-level spandrels in evolution, this single theme, more than any other in this book, unites and exemplifies the weaknesses on all three legs of the tri­pod of essential postulates in conventional Darwinian logic, while also point­ing the way towards revisions that will expand and strengthen these three supports to produce an improved, and more comprehensive, evolutionary theory by retaining its Darwinian basis in the expanded form of a fully hierar­chical theory, while adding, to its preserved selectionist core, several aids and flavors from alternative traditions of structuralist thought.

Thus, the hierarchical theory of selection (for strengthening and expansion of the first leg) greatly augments the role of spandrels by adding the cross-level category as more potent in numbers and more various in potential re­sults than the traditional at-level category. For at-level spandrels, in the usual Darwinian account of selection as a uniquely organismal process, must re­main confined to structural byproducts and space fillers within a context of integral adaptation of the body. But if selection works simultaneously at sev­eral hierarchically ordered levels of biological individuality, then the domain of spandrels expands to include any enjoined expression (upon Darwinian individuals at other levels) of changes causally introduced at a focal level — for these injected and adventitious expressions must originate nonadaptively (and “randomly” in our usual loose parlance) relative to their causal reasons of origin at the focal level of their construction.

By the same token, spandrels become structural constraints rather than di­rect adaptations (or even alternative potentials of direct adaptations) — that is, they enter the exaptive pool as miltonic things rather than franklinian po­tentials. Moreover, as constraints of this type, they add a structuralist and nonadaptationist component to the workings of evolution — thus strengthen­ing the tripod on leg two by including aspects of this formerly rejected mode of causation among the totality of devices that generate creative change in evolution. On a more specific note, if cross-level spandrels maintain an im­portant relative frequency among the components of evolutionary change, then these automatic expressions at other levels — introduced separately from, and simultaneously with, the primary changes that generate them at a differ­ent focal level — may largely control the possibilities and directions of evolution from a structural “inside,” rather than only from the functional “out­side” of natural selection.

Thus, if the positive structural constraints of spandrels — particularly in their cross-level mode as effects propagated to various levels of the evolution­ary hierarchy — can help to explain the phenomenon of evolvability and the parsing of categories in the exaptive pool, then reforms on legs one and two of the essential Darwinian tripod will also illustrate why the extrapolationist premise of the third leg cannot suffice to explain evolution either. For macro-evolution cannot simply be scaled-up from microevolutionary mechanics if the phenomenology of this larger scale depends as much upon the potentials of evolvability as upon the impositions of selection, and if the exaptive pool promotes evolvability largely by the later utility at the same level (or simulta­neous exaptive use at other levels) of spandrels that originate for nonadaptive reasons. The explanation of macroevolution requires structuralist and hierar­chical inputs from various scales, and cannot be fully rendered as an exten­sion of organismal adaptation, smoothly scaled up through the immensity of geological time.





A CLOSING COMMENT TO RESOLVE THE MACROEVOLUTIONARY PARADOX THAT CONSTRAINT ENSURES FLEXIBILITY WHEREAS SELECTION CRAFTS RESTRICTION





In closing this section by reiterating the opening argument (p. 1270) in an­other context, I should extend my previous statement on the bounded inde­pendence of macroevolution to stress the positive theme of interesting differ­ences, and not only a negative claim for the necessary limitation of any explanation based upon pure extrapolation from microevolutionary mechan­ics. For the failure of microevolutionary extrapolation resides in something far deeper than mere insufficiency. Rather, and thus operating to intensify the explanatory gap, a cardinal feature of microevolution works directly against the potentials for macroevolution defined by the exaptive pool — thereby re­quiring that macroevolution proceed by actively overcoming this microevolu­tionary limitation, and not only by “adding value” to its mere insufficiency.

Darwinian evolutionists have known this all along in their heart of hearts, and have tended to escape the resulting paradox by a leap of faith into the en­abling power of geological time to accomplish anything by accumulation of small inputs. Most events of microevolutionary adaptation — that is, of or­dinary Darwinian natural selection in the organismal mode — work against evolvability by locking organisms into transient specializations and reducing the flexibility of the exaptive pool. This fact engenders the central paradox noted above: that immediate organismal processes tend to derail prospects for longterm evolutionary success at the species and clade level. Darwinian traditions have tried to surmount this stumbling block by arguing that, how­ever the process of specialization might restrict future prospects, natural se­lection still makes “better” organisms by rewarding success in direct competi­tion against conspecifics. And at least one component of this “betterness,” albeit a minority component — the occasional achievement of local adapta­tion by general biomechanical improvement, rather than by limiting specialization — must provide the major source of increments for macroevolutionary patterning by extrapolation. But this argument is bankrupt, and I have, throughout this book, chronicled a host of reasons for its failure.

Therefore, the macroevolutionary success of species and clades must arise, in large part, by active utilization of selective processes at their own higher levels, and in opposition to the generally restricting implications and sequelae of microevolution. Moreover, in fueling these macroevolutionary successes, species must exapt the rich potentials supplied by structural and historical constraints of spandrels and other miltonic “things” emplaced into the exap­tive pool against (or orthogonally to) these restricting tendencies of natural selection — in other words, by exploiting the components of a phenomenon that we have loosely called “evolvability” and vaguely recognized as some­thing apart from natural selection. And thus, an expansion of the first leg by hierarchical selection, and a strengthening of the second leg by structural con­straint, really does build a “higher Darwinism” of greater sophistication and explanatory power — an indispensable basis in our struggles to understand “this view of life,” the evolutionary process that made us, and imbued us with all the spandrels of body and soul that force us to ask such difficult ques­tions about the meaning of our own existence and of nature's ways. These spandrels of historical ancestry and structural inevitability may impede our search for solutions by imposing such quirky modalities upon our mental op­erations, but they also grant us more than sufficient power to overcome and prevail. Sweet, and adaptive, are the uses of adversity. Shakespeare, after all, in the words that follow this famous statement, parodied just above, prom­ised us salvation, or at least succor, in natural history, where we would find “tongues in trees, books in the running brooks, sermons in stones, and good in everything.”
