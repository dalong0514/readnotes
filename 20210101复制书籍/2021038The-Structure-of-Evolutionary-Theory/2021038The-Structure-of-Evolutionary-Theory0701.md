## 0701The Modern Synthesis as

a Limited Consensus





Why Synthesis?





A rose may retain its fragrance under all vicissitudes of human taxonomy, but never doubt the power of a name to shape and direct our thoughts. The evolutionary consensus that became such a bulwark of orthodoxy by the time of the Darwinian centennial celebrations of 1959 featured no recognized name in its early days. Fisher offered no general designation for his genetically revivified Darwinism in 1930, nor did Haldane in 1932. Dobzhansky, begin­ning the second wave of integration in 1937, proposed no label, either for the theoretical center or for the general movement.

The accepted name emerged later, and without conscious intent. The “synthetic theory,” or the “modern synthetic theory” — in many ways an oddly uninformative and overly broad name — derives from the title of a book writ­ten by the grandson of Darwin's most effective defender: Evolution, The Modern Synthesis, published by Julian Huxley in 1942. (Historian of science B. Smocovitis (1996) points out that, as a general goal among scholars, syn­thesis enjoyed a great vogue during these years, especially as a central theme for measuring intellectual maturity, as expressed in the “unity of science” movement expounded by positivist philosophers of the Vienna Circle and supported by biological pundits like J. H. Woodger. Ernst Mayr, for example, strongly supported the unity of science movement early in his career, but changed his mind when he began to fear that misplaced claims for grander synthesis would bury natural history in a reductionist scheme to uphold the primacy of physics and chemistry.)

Huxley obviously felt that the morphology of evolutionary consensus could best be described as a synthesis — that is, a gathering together of previ­ously disparate elements around a central core. Following Smocovitis's argu­ment on the favorable Zeitgeist for “synthesis” provided by the “unity of sci­ence” movement, note how Huxley places his chosen name within this wider context by extolling the general virtues of synthesis.

Biology in the last twenty years, after a period in which new disciplines were taken up in turn and worked out in comparative isolation, has become a more unified science. It has embarked upon a period of synthesis, until today it no longer presents the spectacle of a number of semi-inde­pendent and largely contradictory sub-sciences, but is coming to rival the unity of older sciences like physics, in which advance in any one branch leads almost at once to advance in all other fields, and theory and experi­ment march hand-in-hand. As one chief result, there has been a rebirth of Darwinism (1942, p. 26).



Thus we evolutionists have, ever since, called our central theory by a name fashioned for a largely superseded set of concerns. In another sense, however, Huxley chose his name to emphasize a particular scenario for evolutionary science — and a characterization of this history as a “synthesis” seems both reasonable and accurate. Huxley viewed the synthesis, in an interpretation that became common in his time and has remained conventional ever since, as a two-stage process of integration around a renewed Darwinian core. He em­phasized this Darwinian center at the close of the passage cited above, and then offered praise, in purpler prose, to “this reborn Darwinism, this mutated phoenix risen from the ashes of the pyre kindled by men so unlike as Bateson and Bergson” (1942, p.28).

The first phase, reasonably called a synthesis of Mendel and Darwin, re­quired the extinction of Mendelism's first major episode of evolutionary em­ployment in the non-Darwinian saltational theory of de Vries (see Chapter 5). Huxley cites three major steps (1942, p. 25): the recognition that Mendelian principles operate in all organisms, unicellular and multicellular, plant and animal; the key insight that small scale, continuous Darwinian variability also maintains a Mendelian basis; and the mathematical demonstration that small selection pressures acting on minor genetic differences can render evo­lutionary change. This work culminated in the origin of theoretical popula­tion genetics (see Provine, 1971), and led to our almost catechistic invocation of a trinity — Fisher, Haldane, and Wright — as heroes of this first phase. (I do not challenge the attribution, but have long been amused by the almost for­mulaic citation; even the order of names has become invariant — as in another more famous Trinity!)

The second phase, also a “synthesis” in the vernacular sense of the word, began with Dobzhansky's masterful book (1937) and proceeded as a linking of traditional sub disciplines in biology to the core theory forged during the first phase. This activity, already in full swing when Huxley wrote his book, eventually included such classics as Mayr (1942) for systematics, Simpson (1944) for paleontology, White (1945) for cytology, Rensch (1947) for mor­phology, and Stebbins (1950) for botany. Huxley made a good prediction, and hoped that his own effort would fuel the grand integration: “The time is ripe for a rapid advance in our understanding of evolution. Genetics, devel­opmental physiology, ecology, systematics, paleontology, cytology, mathe­matical analysis, and have all provided new facts or new tools of research: the need today is for concerted attack and synthesis. If this book contributes to such a synthetic point of view, I shall be well content” (1942, p. 8).

I accept this traditional account of what the Synthesis synthesized, but I prefer to view the history of the Synthesis under a different rubric and terminology developed by historian of science Will Provine and by myself — namely, (1) restriction followed by (2) hardening, with the first process viewed as largely admirable, the second as mostly dubious.

Provine has argued (1986) that the first phase of synthesizing, the integra­tion of Mendel and Darwin to a core discipline of population genetics, should be viewed as a welcome restriction (a “constriction” in his favored term) — for biologists could now shed the several competing and truly contradictory theories (primarily orthogenetic and saltational) that had made the domain of evolutionary studies seem so anarchic at the Darwinian celebrations of 1909.

But the first phase also included a vigorously pluralistic range of permis­sible mechanisms within the primary restriction. The original synthesists wanted to render all of evolution by known genetic mechanisms; but they tended to agnosticism about relative frequencies among the legitimate phe­nomena, notably on the issue of drift (and other random phenomena) vs. selection.

The second phase began with this pluralism intact, as the first wave of books from the late 1930's and 1940's clearly illustrates. But this broad net then tightened, as the leading synthesists promoted natural selection, first to a commanding frequency and then to virtual exclusivity as an agent of evolu­tionary change. This consensus hardened to orthodoxy, often accompa­nied by strong and largely rhetorical dismissal of dissenting views — a position that reached its acme in the Darwinian centennial celebrations of 1959. The pluralism of “consistent with genetics” eventually narrowed to a restrictive faith in what Weismann had called the “all-sufficiency” of natural selection, with the accompanying requirement that phenotypes be analyzed as prob­lems in adaptation. I almost feel as if the arbiters of fashion and theory had distributed sandpaper to all evolutionists — and that ordinary professional ac­tivity shifted to a vigorous smoothing out of all remaining bumps, facets, and channels of Galton's polyhedron (see pp. 342–351), as organisms became un­fettered billiard balls, rolling wherever the pool cue of natural selection dic­tated upon the crowded table of ecology.

This hardening extended beyond overconfidence in adaptation to a more general, and sometimes rather smug, feeling that truth had now been discov­ered, and that a full account of evolution only required some mopping up and adumbration of details. The paeans of self-satisfaction penned for the 1959 centennial of the Origin (see pp. 569–576) almost invite a parody of Hamlet's insightful comment about his mother's rhetorical overstatements: the writers praised too much, one thinks.





Synthesis as Restriction





THE INITIAL GOAL OF REJECTING OLD ALTERNATIVES





William Bateson, to be sure, had his own particular axe to grind when he so dramatically expressed his pessimism about evolutionary theory in his fa­mous address to the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1922: “faith has given place to agnosticism” (see p. 412 for the full quote). The first rumblings of synthesis had already occurred. As the most obvious and important example, Fisher's pivotal 1918 paper on “The Correlation Be­tween Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance” had demon­strated the potential Mendelian (polygenic) basis for the small-scale, continu­ous variation that Darwinians had always identified as the primary source of evolutionary change — and that the early Mendelians had either ignored as supposedly non-particulate, or denigrated as evolutionarily insignificant (see pp. 429–431 on de Vries's attitude). Fisher's demonstration established a ba­sis for resolving the increasingly fruitless debate between “biometricians” (Darwinian supporters of continuous variation) and “Mendelians” (uphold­ers of saltational change, in the first evolutionary use of principles that would later blend with Darwinism) — a seminal, if ultimately barren, dichotomy in early 20th century biology. By using the principles of one side (Mendelian particulate inheritance) to explain the supposedly contradictory phenomena of the other (continuous and isotropic variation in phenotypes) — and then by banning the opposite (saltational) phenomena originally attached to the prin­ciples — Fisher staged a brilliant coup that surely deserves the label of “synthesis.”

If Bateson had fallen a bit behind the times by 1922, he did accurately re­cord the near anarchy that had prevailed in the study of evolutionary mecha­nisms just a few years earlier. Using Kellogg's (1907) framework, as I have done throughout this book (see pp. 163–169 for an account and rationale), we may classify attitudes outside the central core of Darwinism either as help­ful expansions or as contradictory substitutions — auxiliaries and alternatives in Kellogg's terminology. Kellogg identified three major alternatives to Dar­winism — Lamarckism, saltationism and orthogenesis. At the 1909 celebra­tions for Darwin's centennial, all three alternatives enjoyed substantial sup­port, probably equal in extent, and in the reputation of leading supporters, to the popularity of Darwinism itself. As a supreme and well known irony, the original impact of the Mendelian rediscovery — the ultimate source of restric­tion and synthesis — had only increased the range and intensity of evolution­ary debate by revivifying the saltational alternative and thus augmenting the roster of major challenges to Kellogg's triple threat.

Clearly, the state of evolutionary theory required restriction for further advance — either a settling upon one of the four contenders (Darwinism plus the three challenges), or a new formulation. The first phase of the synthesis accomplished this goal in three major moves: (1) by choosing the Darwinian central core as a proper and fundamental theory; (2) by reading Mendelism in a different way to validate, rather than to confute, this central core; and (3) by utilizing this fusion to ban the three alternatives of Lamarckism, saltation, and orthogenesis.

Darwinism is a functionalist theory with an operational core that must place primary weight upon building adaptation by the mechanism of natural selection (see Chapters 2 and 4). In logic and principle, therefore, the theory could be confuted in either of two ways: by affirming an alternative mechanism for adaptation, or by denying the primacy of functionalism, and propos­ing a dominant role for internal, structuralist shaping of evolutionary change. Provine (1983) has designated the first phase of synthesis as a restriction be­cause the fusion of Darwin with Mendel validated the rejection of all three Kelloggian alternatives, and in both of their more general categories.

Alternative theories of functionalism. Most importantly, this first-stage fusion finally gained enough knowledge and proof to depose the longest and most severe of all challenges to Darwinism — the doctrine that preceded natural selection, and that Darwin himself had both accepted as a subsidiary player and granted an ever-increasing role through subsequent re­visions of The Origin of Species. This so-called, if misnamed, “Lamarckian” theory of soft inheritance and direct production of adaptation by inheritance of acquired characters, had stubbornly persisted through all vicissitudes of evolutionary debate to remain a favorite in certain circles (at least among field naturalists, if not among experimentalists) well into the 1920's.

Mendelians had always rejected Lamarckism as inconsistent with the mechanisms of inheritance, but Darwinians before the synthesis had gener­ally downplayed, ignored or actively rejected Mendelism. The first-stage fu­sion finally gave Darwinian functionalists a tight rationale for outright rejec­tion of this alternative Lamarckian route to adaptation. This clear solution struck most Darwinians as far more satisfactory than the uneasy pluralism that functionalists (including Darwin himself) had been forced to espouse be­fore — for Darwinism and Lamarckism, as pathways to the same result of ad­aptation, had coexisted no more peacefully than most competitors for the same prize. An old motto proclaims that the enemy without should always be preferred to the enemy (or apparent helpmate) who saps your strength from within.*

Demoting internalism. The dismissal of Lamarckism left two strong alternatives in Kellogg's triad: saltationism and orthogenesis (see Chapters 4 and 5). These two challenges to Darwinian functionalism have al­ways been linked in their common focus on internal sources of change and di­rection — as jointly embodied in the metaphor of Galton's polyhedron (see Chapter 5. The reformulation of Mendelism as a source for pervasive, small-scale, continuous variability (and not only for mutations of substantial ex­tent) provoked a strong distaste for saltationism, as early population geneticists denied evolutionary importance to mutations of large effect. At the same time, the Mendelian explanation of this copious and small-scale variability left little scope for orthogenesis. Darwinism surely welcomed this further Mendelian aid, for all functionalist theories must try to smooth Galton's polyhedron.

Yet, while internalist theories endured a pronounced demotion during this first phase of restriction, these alternatives to Darwinism did not suffer the Lamarckian fate of complete dismissal in theory. Saltations could not be ban­ished or denied, but only declared unimportant in evolution. Orthogenesis could not be overthrown in principle, for mutation pressure could conceiv­ably boost the frequency of alleles from within. Moreover, and more impor­tantly as an enjoined consequence of its own premises, population genetics had to acknowledge another potentially substantial source for non-adaptive evolutionary change: the effects of sampling errors, primarily in small popu­lations.

Thus, the first phase of restriction invoked a fusion of Mendel and Darwin to dismiss or downplay the traditional roster of alternatives to Darwinian functionalism. But the resulting theory remained open and pluralistic in wel­coming all notions consistent with the new formulation of Mendelism. I shall devote the rest of this section to three illustrations of the two key properties in this first phase of the synthesis: (i) the revivified Darwinian core, and (ii) toleration of a broad phenomenology, including substantial nonadaptation, so long as results could be rendered by known genetic mechanisms. I will discuss the two most important books of early population genetics: Fisher (1930) and Haldane (1932). Huxley's compendium (1942) should be read as a transitional document, and may belong more properly to the begin­ning of the second phase of hardening, but I include Huxley's book here as a summation of early ideas in the Synthesis, if only for its symbolic role in sup­plying the developing theory with a name.





R. A. FISHER AND THE DARWINIAN CORE





The history of the Modern Synthesis holds special, one might almost say inspirational, interest in the good fortune of its construction by such a fascinat­ing group of scientists — so different in personality, so diverse in philosophical attitude amidst their defining agreement, and so brilliant. I experienced the great intellectual privilege of knowing most of the second-phase founders — and I have tried to understand the personal components of scientific greatness by, for example, contrasting Dobzhansky's infectious enthusiasm with Mayr's fierce commitment and encyclopedism. I have also pondered the intra-individual variety in trying to square the warm and expansive humanism of Simpson's writing with the irascibility of his personality.

The leaders of the first phase were equally fascinating and diverse. Their differences have been discussed extensively, perhaps most cogently by one of the actors himself (Wright, 1978). But R. A. Fisher holds a special status as author of the movement's first major book (1930), and as the most thoroughgoing and uncompromising strict Darwinian among early synthesists. As a great logician and statistician, Fisher explored the Darwinian consequences of small changes in large populations with a consistency and completeness never achieved before. We may choose, in retrospect, to regard the views of other evolutionists as more subtle, or more attuned to nature's diversity and ambiguity — but no one can match Fisher as an advocate of the main line in its pure form. We must therefore treat him as inaugural, in both senses of prior­ity and centrality.

Fisher begins The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection by explaining how the logic of Darwinism requires a particulate theory of inheritance in or­der to achieve self-sustainability as a mechanics of change without special pleading and additional forces. He states in his introduction (1930, pp. vii-viii): “That an independent study of Natural Selection is now possible is prin­cipally due to the great advance which our generation has seen in the science of genetics.”

As an opening gambit, Fisher develops the intriguing argument that Dar­win's forced allegiance to blending inheritance entailed far more than mere inconvenience and surmountable difficulty, thus confuting the usual claim, advanced by scientists who have traditionally viewed the Origin as a com­plete and fully workable theory of natural selection. Rather, Fisher maintains, blending inheritance represented a central impediment, debarring natural se­lection as the chief agent of evolution. By constantly degrading favorable ge­notypes, blending requires an enormous input of new mutation to fuel any process of change. But mutation rates this high could easily overwhelm any reasonable force of natural selection. Evolution would then be propelled largely from within, and natural selection, as a theory of “trial and error externalism,” could not operate as the major cause of change. But a particu­late theory provides raw material for favorable change without degrada­tion — and a vastly lowered rate of new input now suffices. Evolution need not be driven from within, and may now be pulled by the external force of natural selection.

Fisher conceived his argument as a proof by elimination. Once we dispense with a need for such lavish internal stirring, no credible force but natural selection remains. Mendelism therefore validates Darwinism: “The whole group of theories which ascribe to hypothetical physiological mechanisms, controlling the occurrence of mutations, a power of directing the course of evolution, must be set aside, once the blending theory of inheritance is aban­doned. The sole surviving theory is that of Natural Selection” (1930, p. 20).

Fisher illustrates the restrictive character of this first synthetic phase by invoking the fusion of Darwin and Mendel to discard each alternative of Kellogg's triad. Lamarckism (as noted before) goes quickly and gently into that good night — for soft inheritance cannot exist under the newly validated mechanics of Mendelism. Saltationism surrenders when small-scale continu­ous variability gains a Mendelian basis and wins evolutionary effectiveness thereby. This small-scale Mendelian component provides superior evolution­ary raw material for two reasons: (1) overwhelming predominance in sheer amount (saltations occur only rarely, but minor variants are ubiquitous); and (2) greater potential for utility (small changes can often be advantageous, but large excursions will almost always be disruptive — see Fig. 7-1, from Fisher). When De Vries and other biologists had disparaged small-scale variation as ineffective and different in kind from Mendelian effects, saltations had pre­vailed faute de mieux. But once we can assert a continuum in effect and a uni­formity in genetic mechanism for variation at all scales, then we must prefer an omnipresent and potentially advantageous mode to an exceedingly rare and almost always deleterious extreme in the spectrum. Fisher writes: “The chance of improvement, for very small displacements, tends to the limiting value one-half, while it falls off rapidly for increasing displacements (p. 39). In any highly adapted organism the probability of advantage through any considerable evolutionary step (saltation) rapidly becomes infinitesimal as the step is increased in magnitude” (p. 114).

Orthogenesis, the third and last of Kellogg's alternatives to Darwinism, expires with Fisher's initial argument on the virtues of particulate inheritance. The rates of mutation required by Darwinism become much lower under par­ticulate models (and observation confirms that such a workably modest rate of mutation exists in nature). Since orthogenesis can only operate when mu­tation pressure becomes high enough to act as an agent of evolutionary change, empirical data on low mutation rates sound the death-knell of internalism. Fisher writes: “For mutations to dominate the trend of evolution it is thus necessary to postulate mutation rates immensely greater than those which are known to occur, and of an order of magnitude which, in general, would be incompatible with particulate inheritance” (1930, p. 20).

Fisher, with his mathematical training, reigned as the master of abstract

generality among the early synthesists. He favored infinitesimal changes in large panmictic populations, as illustrated by physical metaphors and analo­gies; and he maintained little interest in the historical quirks, vagaries and complex structuring of actual populations. When subject to such constant and unconstrained natural selection in large panmictic populations, living creatures become exquisitely fitted to their environments: “Organisms in gen­eral are, in fact, marvelously and intricately adapted, both in their internal mechanisms, and in their relations to external nature” (p. 41).

In Fisher's world of panadaptationism and pure Darwinian generality, neutralism can only maintain an insignificant relative frequency, and natural selection must reign. “Within such an unrelenting context of slow changes and large populations, Darwinian functionalism must triumph: “The very small range of selective intensity in which a factor may be regarded as effectively neutral suggests that such a condition must in general be extremely transient. The slow changes which must always be in progress, altering the genetic con­stitution and environmental conditions of each species, must also alter the se­lective advantage of each gene contrast” (1930, p. 95).

Many examples could be cited from Fisher's Genetical Theory, but two features strike me as particularly revealing in illustrating Fisher's maximally exclusive and general Darwinism.

The analogy of Fisher's “fundamental theorem” with the second law of thermodynamics. After explicating and justify­ing his “fundamental theorem” of natural selection — “the rate of increase in fitness of any organism at any time is equal to its genetic variance in fitness at that time” (p. 35, Fisher's italics) — Fisher, enamored as ever with physical analogies, compares this central principle of his own construction with the second law of thermodynamics:

It will be noticed that the fundamental theorem proved above bears some remarkable resemblances to the second law of thermodynamics. Both are properties of populations, or aggregates, true irrespective of the nature of the units which compose them; both are statistical laws; each requires the constant increase of a measurable quantity, in the one case the en­tropy of a physical system and in the other the fitness ... of a biological population ... Professor Eddington has recently remarked that “The law that entropy always increases — the second law of thermodynamics — holds, I think, the supreme position among the laws of nature.” It is not a little instructive that so similar a law should hold the supreme position among the biological sciences (1930, p. 36).



In a curious and even ironic sense, the most striking feature of this analogy lies in its imprecision and inaptness (especially as devised and presented by such an exacting thinker) — as Fisher himself admits directly after the state­ment quoted above, when he lists, as exceptions, several “profound differ­ences” (p. 37). (The claim for such generality in physical terms must have struck Fisher as vitally important if he chose to make the comparison, de­clare its status as fundamental, and then immediately proceed to hedge or retract every important similarity!) Consider the first three exceptions listed by Fisher (1930, p. 37):





1. The systems considered in thermodynamics are permanent; species on the contrary are liable to extinction, although biological improve­ment must be expected to occur up to the end of their existence.

2. Fitness, although measured by a uniform method, is qualitatively different for every different organism, whereas entropy, like tempera­ture, is taken to have the same meaning for all physical systems.

3. Fitness may be increased or decreased by changes in the environ­ment, without reacting quantitatively upon that environment.





But what do these exceptions express in ordinary biological parlance? Contingency, individuality, and interaction, for the three points respectively. Could anyone have presented a better list of the peculiarly biological proper­ties that make organisms and their history so intrinsically unlike simpler physical systems that operate by timeless and general laws? Do these differ­ences between physical thermodynamics and Darwinian biology then rank as exceptions or invalidations?

The eugenical chapters. Fisher's Genetical Theory has generally been acknowledged, and properly so, as the keystone of 20th century evolu­tionary theory. Yet few contemporary biologists have actually read the book in extenso, and one feature of this common neglect seems especially puzzling. The last five chapters, nearly 40 percent of the entire volume, present a single coherent (if fatally flawed) argument in eugenics — a claim that modern indus­trial society (particularly the British version) has entered a potentially fatal decline as a result of “social promotion of the relatively infertile.” In essence, Fisher argues that people, who rise socially, by dint of moral or intellectual superiority, also tend to express ineluctable genetic propensities (not revers­ible, environmentally induced preferences) for infertility. This superior upper stratum will therefore be swamped by greater reproduction of less worthy so­cial classes. Throughout human history, most great civilizations have declined for this reason. Society should fight this decay by rewarding gifted and highly fecund members of the lower classes, thereby helping them to rise and rejuve­nate the reproduction of higher social strata.

A tradition of discreet silence has enveloped these chapters. Provine (1971), for example, relegates this material to a single sentence in his impor­tant book (pp. 153-154): “In the concluding five chapters he extended his genetical ideas to human populations.” This discretion, I suppose, reflects our embarrassment that such a paragon of our profession should have ended his canonical book with such a long argument for a politically discredited move­ment (see Gould, 1991c, for an analysis and critique of Fisher's eugenical ar­guments). This professional silence surely cannot reflect a belief that these chapters bear no connection to the rest of the book, and that Fisher merely appended this material to grind his political axe — for Fisher states that he could have dispersed this 40 percent among the other chapters, and then adds (p. x): “The deductions respecting Man are strictly inseparable from the more general chapters.”

I regard the conspiracy of silence about these chapters as both unscholarly and overly fastidious. First of all, how can we justify silence about integral parts of an important thinker's work because we now recoil at his beliefs? (Wagner's antisemitism retains intimate linkage with his musical produc­tions, but we cannot ban such glorious operas.) Second, even if we wish to de­fend such posthumous cleansing, Fisher's eugenics can only be judged as “garden variety” material for his time, and not as especially benighted or vengeful. His visions of proper social stratification may surely be judged elitist (scarcely a rare attitude for an Oxbridge don in class-conscious Brit­ain), but anachronistic exponents of modern political correctness will appre­ciate other facets of his argument. (Fisher, for example, cautiously advocates racial mixing for its role in increasing genetic variance, thereby supplying more material at the right tail of the human distribution, even though admix­ture with a “lower race” — Fisher did not espouse egalitarian beliefs! — might depress the mean.)

But the central relevance of these final chapters lies in the consonance of Fisher's eugenical argument with his commitment to a general and statisti­cal Darwinism. Fisher's eugenics provides our most interesting and incisive affirmation of his evolutionary philosophy. Darwinian triumph must be mea­sured as differential reproductive success, statistically defined in large pop­ulations — not as particularistic victory for nifty bits of morphology (or men­tality) in Tennyson's world of “nature red in tooth and claw.” Moreover, Fisher maintains that our current pattern of degeneration arises from differ­entials in birth rate, not from selective superiority in resisting death — so Dar­winian “success” can only be viewed as statistical leverage in components of reproductive advantage, not as improvement in any social or vernacular sense: “Even the highest death-rate in this period, that in the first year of life, must be quite unimportant compared with slight differences in reproduction; for the infantile-death rate has been reduced in our country to about seven percent of the births, and even a doubling of this rate would make only about a third as much difference to survival as an increase in the family from three children to four” (1930, p. 194).

Finally, this eugenical example illuminates the central Darwinian claim for the power of slight statistical advantage. A truly effective, and truly Darwin­ian, eugenics, Fisher argues, will focus on apparently tiny reproductive differ­entials, and not on the elimination of rare and overt “saltations” — steriliza­tion of the genetically diseased or mentally defective, as in the programs favored by most eugenicists who did not grasp the Darwinian imperative. We might regard small differences in birth rates as trifling, and unlikely to exert much effect upon the rapid time scales of human history. But anything that can be measured at all over the minimal span of a generation or two trans­lates to an enormous effect in evolutionary time. Thus, the social promotion of relative infertility, however “invisible” in comparison to the devastation of war or the progress of technology, will yield an evolutionary degeneration far in excess of almost any other Darwinian change in nature. In evolutionary time, Fisher laments, our social structures disintegrate rapidly; we had better pay heed: “Civilized man, in fact, judging by the fertility statistics of our own time, is apparently subjected to a selective process of an intensity approach­ing a hundredfold the intensities we can expect to find among wild animals, with the possible exception of groups which have suffered a recent and pro­found change in their environment” (1930, p. 199).





J. B. S. HALDANE AND THE INITIAL PLURALISM

OF THE SYNTHESIS





Haldane purposely included a plural in the title of his book — The Causes of Evolution (1932) — for he believed that nothing so encompassing could be so unifactorial. But Haldane wrote his book in the tradition of restriction, pri­marily to debunk Kellogg's triad of alternatives by showing the power of nat­ural selection. He states (p. v) that his book began as a series of lectures enti­tled “A Reexamination of Darwinism,” and he then announces his primary aim in the preface (p. vi): “To prove that mutation, Lamarckian transforma­tion, and so on, cannot prevail against natural selection of even moderate in­tensity.” (Haldane treats the same subject more formally in the book's lengthy mathematical appendix, thus uniting both the front and back matter for a single purpose.)

Haldane presents a conventional account of the revivification of Darwin­ism and the rejection of alternatives. Darwinism had fallen on bad times be­fore the synthesis: “Criticism of Darwinism has been so thoroughgoing that a few biologists and many laymen regard it as more or less exploded” (p. 32). The Darwinian resurrection followed from the recognition that continuous, small-scale variation could also claim a Mendelian basis (p. 71) and, espe­cially, that tiny selection pressures, working in a cumulative manner on such minor variations, could effectively explain all evolution: “But however small may be the selective advantage the new character will spread, provided it is present in enough individuals of the population to prevent its disappearance by mere random extinction.... An average advantage of one in a million will be quite effective in most species” (1932, p. 100).

The development of mathematical population genetics establishes the centerpiece of Darwinian revival. Haldane even begins the tradition of a found­ing trinity in stating, however immodestly (p. 33): “I can write of natural se­lection with authority because I am one of the three people who know most about its mathematical theory.”

However, in contrast to Fisher's quest for pervasive and abstract generality, Haldane felt compelled to bring the smaller and more particular puzzles of natural history under his theoretical umbrella. Here he allows a substantial range of exceptions to Darwinism, albeit at subsidiary frequency — thus illus­trating the predominant pluralism of the early synthesis. Haldane rejects Lamarckism outright, as contrary in principle to the known workings of in­heritance. But, in a remarkable passage, he finds some space, in chinks and corners of the new world of fusion between Darwin and Mendel, for the two internalist theories in Kellogg's triad of alternatives — saltation and ortho­genesis. (In fact, Haldane even repeats the “standard” anti-Darwinian claim for selection's merely subsidiary and negative role in enhancing and stabiliz­ing a saltational change arising by other means — even though Haldane re­gards this alternative mechanism as rare in nature.) Galton's polyhedron cannot be fully rounded by the emerging Darwinian consensus:

But if we come to the conclusion that natural selection is probably the main cause of change in a population, we certainly need not go back completely to Darwin's point of view. In the first place, we have every reason to believe that new species may arise quite suddenly, sometimes by hybridization, sometimes perhaps by other means. Such species do not arise, as Darwin thought, by natural selection. When they have arisen they must justify their existence before the tribunal of natural selection, but that is a different matter... Secondly, natural selection can only act on the variations available, and these are not, as Darwin thought, in every direction. In the first place, most mutations lead to a loss of complexity (e.g. substitution of leaves for tendrils in the pea and sweet pea) or reduction in size of some organ (e.g. wings in Drosophila)... Mutations only seem to occur along certain lines (1932, pp. 138—139).



Two modes of non-Darwinian change especially intrigued Haldane. First, though he tried to reinterpret as many cases as possible in a Darwinian manner, Haldane accepted some paleontological claims for supposedly orthogenetic trends, and he admitted that the developing Darwinian synthesis could find no place for such phenomena: “Many such cases — for example the development of large size or large horns — can, I think, be put down to the ill effects of competition between members of the same species. Others, such as the exaggerated coiling of Gryphaea cannot at present be explained with any strong degree of likelihood” (1932, p. 141). (This example seems especially ironic in retrospect, because Gryphaea's supposed overcoiling to necessary extinction never occurred, and the claim rested upon misreported and misin­terpreted data — see Chapter 10, pp. 1040–1045 and Gould, 1972.)

As his favorite general argument for awarding a small space to ortho­genesis, Haldane cited the putatively higher frequency of degenerational over progressive evolution, arguing that such a tendency probably required an internalist explanation rooted in a bias for deletional mutations: “Degenera­tion is a far commoner phenomenon than progress. It is less striking because a progressive type, such as the first bird, has left many different species as progeny, while degeneration often leads to extinction, and rarely to a wide­spread production of new forms ... But if we consider any given evolutionary level we generally find one or two lines leading up to it, and dozens leading down” (1932, pp. 152-153).

Second, Haldane accepted the common wisdom of taxonomists in his generation that most differentia of species expressed no adaptive significance. He also acknowledged this factual substrate as a primary source of legitimate doubts, then common among taxonomists, about Darwinism: “But when we have pushed our analysis as far as possible, there is no doubt that innumera­ble characters show no sign of possessing selective value, and, moreover, these are exactly the characters which enable a taxonomist to distinguish one species from another. This had led many able zoologists and botanists to give up Darwinism” (1932, pp. 113-114).

Haldane even presents the interesting argument that we have been fooled into accepting a dominant frequency for adaptation by a pronounced bias in the fossil record — the differential preservation of species with persistently large populations subject to control by small Fisherian differentials in natural selection. Perhaps most species exist as much smaller populations, and there­fore become subject to Wrightian dynamics of genetic drift — even if such spe­cies rarely enter the fossil record and therefore fail to leave evidence for their dominant relative frequency. Haldane even cites the highest of all authorities to buttress this idea:





But Wright's theory certainly supports the view taken in this book that the evolution in large random-mating populations, which is recorded by paleontology, is not representative of evolution in general, and perhaps gives a false impression of the events occurring in less numerous species. It is a striking fact that none of the extinct species, which, from the abun­dance of their fossil remains, are well known to us, appear to have been in our own ancestral line. Our ancestors were mostly rather rare crea­tures. “Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth” (1932, pp. 213-214).





J. S. HUXLEY: PLURALISM OF THE TYPE





As with Haldane, Huxley also credited a well-received lecture that he had presented on Darwinism as the stimulus for writing his much longer book — a 1936 presidential address to the British Association on “Natural selection and evolutionary progress.” Huxley maintained the focus of this lecture in presenting a thoughtful, but partisan, defense of Darwinism throughout Evo­lution, The Modern Synthesis, beginning with a wry comment on the exten­sive pessimism so common before the movement he christened: “The death of Darwinism has been proclaimed not only from the pulpit, but from the bio­logical laboratory; but, as in the case of Mark Twain, the reports seem to have been greatly exaggerated, since today Darwinism is very much alive” (1942, p. 22).

Huxley encapsulates the central logic of Darwinism in much the same way, and with the same intent, that I advocate in this book. He recognizes the three main characteristics of variation as central (pp. 22-24) — copiousness (though not pervasive enough for mutation pressure to overwhelm selection), small-ness of phenotypic effect, and nondirectionality — and he credits Mendelism with providing the physical explanation for what Darwin could only deduce from first principles of natural selection, while hoping for later confirmation from discoveries about the basis of heredity.

In an interesting discussion on the nature of theories and their central logic, Huxley disputes Lancelot Hogben's claim that the Mendelian fusion had so altered Darwin's own notion of mechanics, that the reformulation of Fisher, Haldane, and Wright should neither bear Darwin's name nor even retain the term “natural selection” for its central mechanism. Huxley replies that all theories must change by growth, but that the proper standard for mainte­nance of a name must be defined by continuity in key precepts in a central logic:

Hogben is perfectly right in stressing the fact of the important differences in content and implication between the Darwinism of Darwin or Weismann and that of Fisher or Haldane. We may, however, reflect that the term atom is still in current use and the atomic theory not yet rejected by physicists, in spite of the supposedly indivisible units having been di­vided. This is because modern physicists still find that the particles called atoms by their predecessors do play an important role, even if they are compound and do occasionally lose or gain particles and even change their nature. If this is so, biologists may with a good heart continue to be Darwinians and to employ the term Natural Selection, even if Darwin knew nothing of mendelizing mutation (1942, p. 28).



Huxley also follows the English tradition (see pp. 116-119) for central emphasis upon adaptation in the definition of evolutionary mechanisms. He speaks of “a functionally-guided course of evolution” (p. 39), and almost claims an a priori status for panadaptationism: “Our enumeration will also serve as a reminder of the omnipresence of adaptation. Adaptation cannot but be universal among organisms, and every organism cannot be other than a bundle of adaptations, more or less detailed and efficient, coordinated in greater or lesser degree” (1942, p. 420).

But as further evidence for pluralism in the early synthesis, and despite this emphasis upon the ubiquity of adaptation, Huxley then speaks favorably of the same challenges and exceptions that intrigued Haldane — orthogenesis and nonadaptation. Whereas he does claim (correctly) that most cases of sup­posed orthogenesis only represent instances of phyletic constraint, he also provides an interesting taxonomy of genuine examples. Mirroring our mod­ern distinction between positive and negative meanings of constraint (see Chapter 10, pp. 1025–1061, and Gould, 1989a), Huxley speaks of dominant and subsidiary orthogenetic restriction:

True orthogenetic restriction depends on a restriction of the type and quantity of genetic variation. When dominant it prescribes the direction of evolution: when subsidiary it merely limits its possibilities... Domi­nant orthogenetic restriction [is] very rare, if indeed it exists at all... Subsidiary orthogenetic restriction is probably frequent, but we are not yet able to be sure in most cases whether a limitation of variation as ac­tually found in a group is due to a limitation in the supply of mutations or to selection, or to other causes. It is, however, certain that some mutational effects recur regularly in some allied species, and probable that this phenomenon is widespread (1942, p. 524).



Huxley also cites overcoiling in Gryphaea (Trueman, 1922) — the classic case of his time, though since invalidated (Gould, 1972) — as a primary puz­zlement and most promising example for “dominant orthogenesis”:

We must provisionally face an explanation in terms of orthogenesis — i.e. of evolution predetermined to proceed within certain narrow limits, irrespective of selective disadvantage except where this leads to total extinc­tion. It should be noted that, even if the existence of orthogenesis in this cause [sic, for case] be confirmed, it appears to be a rare and exceptional phenomenon, and that we have no inkling of any mechanism by which it may be brought about. It is a description, not an explanation. Indeed its existence runs counter to fundamental selectionist principles (1942, p. 509).



Despite his general commitment to adaptation, Huxley also granted some importance (beyond mere existence) to Wright's genetic drift in the formation of species with small population sizes (p. 58). He even extended the power of this non-adaptational force to the origin of generic differences, though not beyond: “It may be presumed, on somewhat indirect evidence, that 'useless' non-adaptive differences due to isolation of small groups may be enlarged by the addition of further differences of the same sort to give generic distinction, though it seems probable that differences of family or higher rank are always or almost always essentially adaptive in nature” (1942, p. 44).

Thus, the early synthesis, in the view of both its founders and its namegiver, reinstated Darwinism as the centerpiece of evolutionary theory by rejecting any substantial role for the full spate of previously popular alternatives. (I should say “instated,” for Darwinism had never before attained majority ap­peal as a mechanism, even during Darwin's lifetime.) But the early synthesists, with Fisher's exception, also left a few facets intact on Galton's polyhedron. Their interest lay in showing that our increasing knowledge of the Mendelian world could establish natural selection as the primary cause of evolutionary change, not in staking a claim for Darwinian exclusivity.





Synthesis as Hardening





THE LATER GOAL OF EXALTING SELECTION'S POWER





Evolutionists have generally depicted the second phase of the Synthesis as a gathering of traditional subdisciplines under an umbrella constructed during the first phase by fusing Mendel with Darwin. I learned something fundamen­tal about this second phase as a participant at the conference, entitled Work­shop on the Evolutionary Synthesis that Ernst Mayr convened in Boston in 1974. This conference — an amazing experience for a young evolutionist at the beginning of a career — included every major living participant in the Syn­thesis except Bernhard Rensch, who was ill; G. G. Simpson, who was angry; and Sewall Wright, whom Mayr simply would not invite, despite pleas from yours truly and several others. I don't think I ever experienced a greater mo­ment of pure “academic awe” than my first impression, when I looked across from “our” side of the table (where Mayr had placed the “young” historians and evolutionists) and saw Dobzhansky, Mayr, and Stebbins, Ford, and Darling­ton all together on the other side.

This marvelous conference was marred (in terms of its stated purpose) only by a severe difficulty in keeping these men to the intended subject of their reminiscences about past accomplishments. They all remained so passion­ately involved in modern research that, whenever the planned reminiscences began, someone would make a reference to the latest paper revising some view or another — and they would immediately begin a learned discussion about current events, fueled by delight at new findings that forced revisions of their old certainties! (A difficulty for the conference's stated aim perhaps, but personally one of the most memorable events that I have ever witnessed. If the best practitioners can maintain such openness and involvement to the end of their lives, then scholarship need not fear ossification. Such traits do not, however and alas, represent the norm in science — so I did come to under­stand the special excellence of these extraordinary men, and I did achieve some visceral grasp of why they, and not others, made the Synthesis.)

I had always viewed the books of the second phase as coequal. But the conference discussions emphasized a major point previously unclear to me: the preeminence of Dobzhansky's 1937 book, Genetics and the Origin of Species. This volume did not merely happen to enjoy the luck of first publication in a series — a temporal primus inter pares, so to speak. Dobzhansky's volume provided a direct and primary inspiration for the books that followed. Speaker after speaker rose to state that his own contribution had been prod­ded by reading Dobzhansky's account first.

And now the irony — and the key point about disjunction between the two phases of the Synthesis. If we wish to argue that the first phase of synthe­sis featured the construction of population genetics by Fisher, Haldane and Wright, while the second phase brought traditional subdisciplines into this framework, we should expect the primary translator to be fluent in the lan­guage of transfer. In one sense, Dobzhansky did possess the requisite flu­ency — uniquely (at least for English-speaking scientists), and for an interest­ing reason of national traditions. As I also learned at the 1974 conference, only in Russia had Mendelian experimental work been merged, extensively and successfully, with traditional taxonomy and natural history. Dobzhansky, after all, had developed expertise as both a skilled Drosophila experimentalist and a specialist on the taxonomy of coccinellid beetles (ladybirds). In America and Western Europe, experimentalism and field biology occupied two different and largely hostile worlds. Could the second phase of the syn­thesis have emerged from a Western Drosophila lab like T. H. Morgan's (where field biology held low status and enjoyed no practice — see p. 532), or a museum program in comprehensive systematics (with virtually no experi­mental facilities)? Dobzhansky exported a fusion that Western science, in ig­norance of the Russian language and in hostility to communist politics, had failed to recognize — even though H. J. Muller had brought the first Dro­sophila stocks to Russia, thus fueling Dobzhansky's optimal training with a Western trigger.

But if Dobzhansky could integrate the Mendelian experimental world with natural history, what about the supposed centerpiece of mathematical popu­lation genetics? Here, by his own repeated, almost gleeful, admission, Dob­zhansky remained a near dunce. He did not study, nor could he even under­stand, the details of this literature. Of his long and fruitful collaboration with Sewall Wright, Dobzhansky simply said that he had followed the principle of “father knows best” — that is, he bypassed Wright's mathematical manipula­tions and accepted his English explanations on faith. In fact, of all the great second-phase synthesists only G. G. Simpson possessed sufficient mathemati­cal background to read and understand these papers.

Dobzhansky's willingness to accept an incomprehensible literature, and the later acquiescence of so many leaders from other subdisciplines (largely via Dobzhansky's “translation”), testify to a powerful shared culture among evolutionists — a set of assumptions accepted without fundamental question­ing or perceived need to grasp the underlying mechanics. Such a sense of community can lead to exhilarating, active science (but largely in the accu­mulative mode, as examples cascade to illustrate accepted principles). As a downside, however, remaining difficulties, puzzles, anomalies, unresolved corners, and bits of illogic may retreat to the sidelines — rarely disputed and largely forgotten (or, by the next generation, never learned). This situation may sow seeds of an orthodoxy that can then become sufficiently set and un­challenged to verge on dogma — as happened in many circles, at least among large numbers of epigones, at the acme of the Synthesis in the late 1950's and 1960's.

In this section, I shall try to illustrate one example in extenso — the central and defining case, I believe — of the narrowing suffered by a synthesis that be­came augmented in power but downgraded in the art and tactic of question­ing. I call this increasing confidence, bordering on smugness, the “hardening” of the Synthesis. Thus I contrast the positive restriction of the first phase — the elaboration of a generous and comprehensive theory, and the invalidation of false and fruitless alternatives — with the negative tightening that occurred during the ontogeny of the second phase. This hardening — still our legacy to­day — must serve as a starting point for any current attempt to introduce more amplitude into evolutionary theory. The hard version of the Synthesis pro­vides a standard for judging (by contrast) the interest and importance of modern revisions — from neutralism,* to punctuated equilibrium, to a com­mon feeling that the theme of developmental constraints not only gives sub­stance to an old truth, but also confutes the hardened version's commitment to Darwin's (I should really say Fisher's) billiard ball against Galton's poly­hedron.

My example shall trace the transformation of adaptation from an option to be ascertained (albeit favored and granted a dominant relative frequency) to an a priori assumption of near ubiquity (save in trivial or derivative situa­tions without evolutionary importance) — in other words the burnishing of Galton's polyhedron to the billiard ball of pure functionalism (allowing no significant pushing back from internal structure upon the direction of evolu­tionary change). This hardening buttressed (or rather, in my view, overly rigidified and sclerotised) one leg on the essential Darwinian tripod of sup­port — the second theme of functionalism against internalist and structuralist forces (see Chapters 2, 4, and 5).

But hardening pervaded all major themes of Darwinian central logic, and the other two legs of the tripod also experienced their own form of petrifac­tion (treated in less detail in Section 4 of this chapter). Pluralistic (and, admit­tedly, often loose) thinking about levels of selection yielded to an explicit pro­mulgation of organismic selection as the only acceptable mode — as a virtual campaign to root out group selection accompanied the battle of Williams (1966) against Wynne-Edwards (1962). Thirdly, a willingness to grant some independence, or at least some puzzlement, to patterns in macroevolution (see Haldane and Huxley's respectful view of orthogenesis, as discussed in the last section), ceded to the hard view that all phenomena measured in millions of years must be explained by smooth extrapolation from palpable causes on generational scales in modern populations — and that the paleontological re­cord can therefore only present a pageant of products generated by known causes, and not provide an independent theory or even a set of additional causal principles.

I have used a particular method to demonstrate the hardening of the Synthesis — textual comparison of early and later works by key authors. Ontog­eny can be an unconscious trickster. In trying to forge sense and continuity in our own lives, we often forget or “reconstruct” the actualities of our early years — thus subtly recasting our former selves as miniatures of our current beliefs. Therefore, direct interview can be a notoriously unreliable technique (while representing, ostensibly, the most direct and empirical of all scholarly sources) — for an older person may become a very unreliable chronicler of his own past. But written records stand as frozen testimonies, unaltered fossils of a time that may not be personally recoverable with high accuracy.

I received my first insight into the hardening of the Synthesis by a proper (if gentle) pedagogical correction. During my graduate student years, I presented a report on paleontology in the Modern Synthesis to a seminar at the Ameri­can Museum of Natural History. In the characteristically naive manner of a young and awestruck protoscholar, I explicated the views of Simpson and others as jewels of reforming consistency, lux in tenebris and complete from the first. Bobb Schaeffer, a wonderful teacher, stopped me as I was explaining Simpson's complex idea of “quantum evolution” (see p. 530). I had done well, he said, for the concept as presented in Simpson's 1953 book, but had I ever studied the original version in Tempo and Mode in Evolution (1944)? I replied that I had not read this initial formulation, for I had assumed that the first account could only represent a less developed, and therefore pale and trifling, version of later subtlety. Schaeffer said that the two discussions dif­fered fundamentally, but that Simpson had minimized the appearance of change by retaining the same terms while profoundly altering their meaning. (Schaeffer also told me that he had argued the issue with Simpson for years, and that the essence of Simpson's change, for which Schaeffer took some credit — a shift from nonadaptionist to selectionist interpretation of interme­diate forms in major phyletic transitions — had only strengthened the general argument, even though Simpson had covered up his changes.) I did not be­lieve that most of the profession could have missed such a major shift, but I checked. Schaeffer was entirely right.

My personal failure piqued my interest and I began to wonder whether Simpson's change had been idiosyncratic or part of an unrecognized pat­tern. I began to check early and late works of other key figures, particularly Dobzhansky and Mayr. All had moved from pluralism to strict adaptation-ism — and along a remarkably similar path. I began to view this transition as the major ontogenetic event of the Synthesis during its second phase. I chris­tened this change as the “hardening” of the Synthesis and wrote four papers on the subject (Gould, 1980e, 1982d, 1983b and c). The rest of this section documents my three favorite cases — Dobzhansky through the three editions (1937, 1941, and 1951) of his seminal book, Mayr (1942 vs. 1963), and Simpson (1944 vs. 1953) — and reproduces a good deal of material from my earlier articles.

Several historians have tested my hypothesis by application to other key figures, and have affirmed the adaptational hardening as general (e.g., Beatty, 1988, and Smocovitis, 1996, 2000). Sewall Wright, subject of Provine's mas­sive biography (1986; see also Provine, 1971), provides the most interesting and revealing case. Wright's name, of course, immediately evokes the phe­nomenon of genetic drift, generally called the “Sewall Wright effect” in articles of the early Synthesis. One would therefore regard Wright as the man most likely to speak for the importance of nonadaptation, and against any functionalist hardening.

In fact, when interviewed late in life, as both Provine and I can attest, Wright complained bitterly that his views on the evolutionary role of genetic drift had been consistently misinterpreted (Wright died in 1988 at age 98, sharp as ever to the very end). Since genetic drift describes stochastic change in gene frequencies by sampling error, one might assume that Wright had ad­vocated a radically non-Darwinian approach to evolutionary change by de­moting selection and adaptation, and boosting the importance of accident. But Wright strongly denied such an interpretation of his views. He argued, with evident justice apparent to anyone who reads the works of his last thirty years, that his theory of “shifting balance,” while providing an important role for genetic drift, remains strongly adaptationist — though adaptation generally arises at a level higher than the traditional Darwinian focus on organisms.

In brief (see p. 555 for a fuller account), Wright asserted that he had invoked genetic drift primarily as a generator of raw material to fuel an adaptationist process of interdemic selection. If the founding deme of a new species occupies one adaptive peak on a complex landscape (to use standard Wrightian imagery), movement to additional peaks requires genetic drift — for this stochastic process permits small demes to descend slopes and enter valleys, where selection can then draw a deme up to another peak. When demes within a single species populate several peaks, interdemic selection can operate as a powerful mechanism of adaptation.

Wright therefore (and accurately) depicted his later shifting balance theory as adaptationist, and as invoking drift only for a source of variation among demes. But Wright, though estranged in many ways from the developing synthesis (see Section 4), followed its trend toward increasingly exclusive emphasis upon adaptation in evolutionary change. The version of shifting balance that Wright advocated during the last 30 years of his life did not orig­inate by sudden creation, complete in this final form. Shifting balance em­phasized different themes and arguments in Wright's earlier work, and these articles, written during the pluralistic phase of the synthesis, granted a much greater role to randomness and nonadaptation in evolutionary change. In fact, Wright often, and explicitly, invoked drift as a non-Darwinian agent of change in articles written during the early pluralistic phase of the syn­thesis.

Wright presents a striking example of the principle that later recollections may be inferior, as historical sources, to written testimony from the time in question. Provine (1986) has catalogued Wright's ambiguities and multiple intents during the crucial period of 1929-1932. The later selectionist view al­ready stands in the wings, but most passages of these early articles advocate the nonadaptationist role for drift that Wright would later reject (and deny he ever held). Wright wrote in 1931 (p. 158), for example, that shifting balance “originates new species differing for the most part in nonadaptive respects.” In the following year, he stated (1932): “That evolution involves nonadaptive differentiation to a large extent at the subspecies and even the species level is indicated by the kinds of differences by which such groups are actually distinguished by systematists. It is only at the subfamily and family levels that clear-cut adaptive differences become the rule. The principal evolutionary mechanism in the origin of species must then be an essentially nonadaptive one” (pp. 363-364). Provine (1986) concludes: “The careful reader in 1932 would almost certainly conclude that Wright believed nonadaptive random drift was a primary mechanism in the origin of races, subspecies, species, and perhaps genera. Wright's more recent view that the shifting balance theory should lead to adaptive responses at least by the subspecies level is found nowhere in the 1931 and 1932 paper.”





INCREASING EMPHASIS ON SELECTION AND ADAPTATION

BETWEEN THE FIRST (1937) AND LAST (1951) EDITION OF

DOBZHANSKY'S GENETICS AND THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES





Dobzhansky's original probe (1937) toward synthesis operated more as a methodological claim for the sufficiency of genetics than a strong substantive advocacy of any particular causal argument — although he clearly states his general Darwinian preferences in this first edition. Dobzhansky held, con­trary to his own Russian mentor Filipchenko, that the methods of experi­mental genetics can provide enough principles to encompass evolution at all levels. But Dobzhansky did not play favorites among the admitted set of legit­imate principles. He did not, in particular, proclaim the pervasive power of natural selection leading to adaptation as a predominant style and outcome of evolutionary change.

Some inkling of the chaotic and depressed state of evolutionary theory be­fore the Synthesis can be glimpsed in a simple list of previously popular argu­ments that Dobzhansky regarded as sufficiently important to refute — claims that denied his hope for synthesis by treating Mendelian processes observed in the laboratory as different from the genetic modes for regulating “impor­tant” evolutionary change in nature. Dobzhansky rebuts the following argu­ments explicitly: Continuous variation in nature is non-Mendelian and differ­ent in kind from discrete mutational variation in laboratory stocks (p. 57); Mendelian variation can only generate differences between taxa of low rank (races to genera), while higher taxa owe their distinctions to another (and un­known) genetic process (p. 68); chromosomal changes are always destructive and can only lead to degeneration of stocks (p. 83); differences between taxa of low rank are directly induced by the environment and have no genetic or evolutionary basis (p. 146); Johannsen's experiments on pure lines prove the ineffectiveness of natural selection as a mechanism of evolutionary change (p. 150); selection is too slow in large populations to render evolution, even in geological time (p. 178); genetic principles cannot account for the origin of reproductive isolation (p. 255).

Dobzhansky's fifth chapter, on “variation in natural populations,” stresses the pluralism of the early synthesis. Observable genetic phenomena provide a source for all evolution; we can trace full continuity from studies in the laboratory, to variation within natural populations, to formation of races and species:

It is now clear that gene mutations and structural and numerical chromosome changes are the principal sources of variation. Studies of these phenomena have been of necessity confined mainly to the laboratory and to organisms that are satisfactory as laboratory objects. Nevertheless, there can be no reasonable doubt that the same agencies have supplied the materials for the actual historical process of evolution. This is at­tested by the fact that the organic diversity existing in nature, the differ­ences between individuals, races, and species, are experimentally resolv­able into genic and chromosomal elements, which resemble in all respects the mutations and the chromosomal changes that arise in the laboratory (1937, p. 118).



But what forces mold and preserve this variation in nature? Dobzhansky stresses natural selection (p. 120), but he does not grant this process the dom­inant role that later “hard” versions of the synthesis would confer. He em­phasizes genetic drift (which he calls “scattering of the variability”) as a fun­damental mode of evolutionary change in nature, not as an odd phenomenon occurring in populations too small to leave any historical legacy. He argues that local races can form without influence from natural selection, and he supports Crampton's (1916, 1932) interpretation of the nonadaptive and in­determinate character of substantial racial differentiation in the Pacific land snail Partula. He emphasizes that evolutionary dynamics depend, in large measure, upon the size of populations because selection does not always con­trol the outcome (and we therefore need information about numbers of indi­viduals and their mobility in order to assess the effects of drift, migration, and isolation). He coins the term “microgeographic race” and argues that most group distinctions at this level may be both nonadaptive and genetically based, contrary to the opinions of many naturalists who then regarded such races as adaptive and nongenetic.

The sixth chapter then treats natural selection explicitly. Dobzhansky be­gins by clearing away some early Mendelian misconceptions about the impo­tence of natural selection (logical errors in interpreting Johannsen's experi­ments on pure lines, for example). He then poses a central question: Darwin devised the theory of natural selection to explain adaptation; admitting Dar­win's success in this area, may we then extrapolate and argue that selection controls the direction of all evolutionary change (p. 150)? Dobzhansky an­swers that we cannot defend such an extension of selection's power. He then criticizes the strict selectionism of Fisher (p. 151), and praises a book that would later be castigated by all leading synthesists as a remnant of older and unproductive ways of thought — Robson and Richards (1936), with their de­fense of a nonadaptive origin for most subspecific and even interspecific dif­ferences in closely related forms.

A long concluding section (pp. 185-191) supports Wright's “island model” of selection among semi-isolated demes occupying different peaks of an adap­tive landscape. Dobzhansky pleads for more study of “the physiology of pop­ulations” since Wright's model proclaims three factors as important in differ­ent ways, while not granting inherent predominance to any: genetic drift, migration, and natural selection: “Since evolution as a biogenic process obvi­ously involves an interaction of all of the above agents, the problem of the rel­ative importance of the different agents unavoidably presents itself. For years this problem has been the subject of discussion. The results of this discussion so far are notoriously inconclusive; the 'theories of evolution' arrived at by different investigators seem to depend upon the personal predilections of the theorist” (p. 186). Dobzhansky does, however, suggest that Wright's model may validate the common conviction of naturalists that the morphological differentia of races and species must often be nonadaptive.

Genetics and the Origin of Species went through three editions (1937, 1941, and 1951). As in the successive versions of Darwin's Origin, the differ­ences among these editions cannot be dismissed as trivial or cosmetic, for they convey a major change in emphasis — an alteration that set the research program for most evolutionary biologists until the past few years. As the Syn­thesis developed, the adaptationist program grew in influence and prestige, and other modes of evolutionary change fell into disrepute, or became rede­fined as locally operative but unimportant in the overall picture.

Dobzhansky's third edition (1951) clearly reflects this hardening. He still insists, of course, that not all change can be called adaptive. He attributes the frequency of some traits to equilibrium between opposed mutation rates (p. 156) and doubts the adaptive nature of racial variation in blood types. He asserts the importance of genetic drift (pp. 165, 176) and does not accept as proof of panselectionism one of the centerpieces of the adaptationist pro­gram — A. J. Cain's work on frequencies of banding morphs in the British land snail Cepaea (p. 170).

But inserted passages and shifting coverage convey, as their common focus, Dobzhansky's increasing faith in the scope and power of natural selection, and in the adaptive nature of most evolutionary change. He deletes the two chapters that contained most material on nonadaptive or nonselected phe­nomena (polyploidy and chromosomal changes, though he includes their ma­terial, in much reduced form, within other chapters). He adds a new chapter on “adaptive polymorphism” (pp. 108-134). Moreover, he now argues that anagenesis, or “progressive” evolution, works only through the optimizing, winnowing agency of selection based on competitive deaths; species adapting by increased fecundity in unpredictably fluctuating environments do not con­tribute to anagenesis (p. 283).

But the most remarkable addition occurs right at the beginning. I label these passages remarkable because I doubt that Dobzhansky really believed what he literally said; I feel confident that he would have modified his words had anyone pointed out how his increasing fascination for adaptationism had led him to downgrade the deepest and oldest of evolutionary themes to effective invisibility (see Chapter 10, pp. 1175–1178 for the modern relevance and refutation of this striking image).

Dobzhansky poses the key question of organic form and taxonomy: why do organisms form discrete and clearly nonrandom “clumps” in populating morphological space? Why does the domain of mammalian carnivores con­tain a large cluster of cats, another of dogs, a third of bears, leaving so much unoccupied morphological space between? Dobzhansky begins by “promot­ing” Wright's model of the “adaptive landscape” to an inappropriate level. In so doing, Dobzhansky subtly shifts the model's meaning from an explanation for nonoptimality (with important aspects of nonadaptation) to an adaptationist argument about best solutions. Wright devised his model to explain differentiation among demes within a species. He proposed the metaphorical landscape to justify a fundamentally nonadaptationist claim: If a “best solu­tion” exists for the phenotype of a species (the highest peak in the landscape), why don't all demes reside there? But if we “upgrade” the model to encom­pass differences between species within a clade, then metaphorical landscapes mutate into a framework for strict adaptationism. Each peak now becomes the optimal form for a single species (not the nonoptimal form for some demes within a species). And related peaks represent a set of best solutions as the various adaptations of separate evolutionary entities within a clade.

Dobzhansky then attempts to solve the problem of clumping with an adaptationist argument based upon the organization of ecological space into preexisting optimal “places” where good design may find a successful home. Evolution has produced a cluster of cats because an “adaptive range,” stud­ded with adjacent peaks, exists in the economy of nature, waiting, if you will, for creatures to move in. In other words, discontinuity in taxonomic space maps discontinuity in optimal form for available environments, with adapta­tion as the agent for mapping.





The enormous diversity of organisms may be envisaged as correlated with the immense variety of environments and of ecological niches, which exist on earth. But the variety of ecological niches is not only im­mense, it is also discontinuous . . . The adaptive peaks and valleys are not interspersed at random. “Adjacent” adaptive peaks are arranged in groups, which may be likened to mountain ranges in which the separate pinnacles are divided by relatively shallow notches [sic, Dobzhansky does indeed mean “notches” in this passage, not “niches” (as later in the quotation)]. Thus, the ecological niche occupied by the species “lion” is relatively much closer to those occupied by tiger, puma, and leopard than to those occupied by wolf, coyote, and jackal. The feline adaptive peaks form a group different from the group of the canine “peaks.” But the feline, canine, ursine, musteline, and certain other groups of peaks form together the adaptive “range” of carnivores, which is separated by deep adaptive valleys from the “ranges” of rodents, bats, ungulates, pri­mates, and others. In turn, these “ranges” are again members of the adaptive system of mammals, which are ecologically and biologically segregated, as a group, from the adaptive systems of birds, reptiles, etc. The hierarchic nature of the biological classification reflects the objec­tively ascertainable discontinuity of adaptive niches, in other words the discontinuity of ways and means by which organisms that inhabit the world derive their livelihood from the environment (pp. 9-10).



Thus, Dobzhansky renders the hierarchical structure of taxonomy as a fitting of clades into preexisting ecological spaces. Discontinuity emerges not so much as a function of history, but as a reflection of adaptive topography. But this interpretation cannot hold; surely, the cluster of cats exists primarily as a consequence of homology and historical constraint. All felines share a basic morphology because they arose from the common ancestor of this clade alone. We doubt neither the excellent adaptation of this common ancestor nor the claim that all descendants may fit equally well into their current envi­ronments. But the feline group and the gaps that separate this cluster from other families of carnivores reflect history above all, not the current organiza­tion of ecological topography. All feline species have inherited the unique Bauplan of cats, and cannot deviate far from this commonality as they adapt, each in its own particular way. Genealogy, not current adaptation, provides the primary source for clumped distribution in morphological space.





THE SHIFT IN G. G. SIMPSON'S EXPLANATION OF “QUANTUM EVOLUTION” FROM DRIFT AND NONADAPTATION (1944) TO THE EMBODIMENT OF STRICT ADAPTATION (1953)





Although Simpson, probably more than Dobzhansky, personally favored selectionist arguments in the initial version of his seminal work (1944), he also adopted a pluralistic stance at first. In fact, at the crux of his book, Simpson proposed an explicitly nonadaptationist theory to resolve the greatest anom­aly in the fossil record; he also considered this theory of “quantum evolu­tion” as the crowning achievement of his book.

Like Dobzhansky in his first edition (1937), Simpson (1944) espoused consistency of all evolutionary change with principles of modern genetics as his primary assertion for a general and synthetic theory. The major challenge to unity and consistency arose from the infamous “gaps” or discontinuities of the fossil record — particularly at the largest scale of appearances for new Bauplan without fossil intermediates. Simpson wrote:

The most important difference of opinion, at present, is between those who believe that discontinuity arises by intensification or combination of the differentiating processes already effective within a potentially or really continuous population and those who maintain that some essen­tially different factors are involved. This is related to the old but still vital problem of micro-evolution as opposed to macro-evolution ... If the two proved to be basically different, the innumerable studies of microevolution would become relatively unimportant and would have minor value to the study of evolution as a whole (1944, p. 97).



To explain these discontinuities, Simpson relied, in part, upon the classical argument of an imperfect fossil record. But he also conceded that such a prominent pattern could not be interpreted as entirely artificial — and he rec­ognized that his favored process of gradualistic Darwinian selection in the phyletic mode would not provide a full explanation. He therefore proposed his book's only major departure from explanations based upon selection lead­ing directly to adaptation — and thus, in his most striking and original contri­bution, framed the hypothesis of quantum evolution.

Simpson clearly took great pride in this novel theory, for he ended his book with a twelve-page defense of quantum evolution, identified as “perhaps the most important outcome of this investigation, but also the most controversial and hypothetical” (p. 206). Faced with the prospect of abandoning strict se­lection in the gradual, phyletic mode, he framed a hypothesis that adhered rigidly to his more important goal — the proviso that macroevolution must be rendered by genetical models and mechanisms operating within species, and amenable to study in living populations. Thus, he focused upon the only ma­jor phenomenon in the literature of population genetics that permitted a mechanism other than selection to serve as a basis for directional change — Sewall Wright's genetic drift.

He envisaged major transitions as occurring within small populations (where drift might be effective and preservation in the fossil record virtually inconceivable). He chose the phrase “quantum evolution” because he con­ceived the process as an “all-or-none reaction” (p. 199) propelling a small population across an “inadaptive phase” — explicitly so named — from one stable adaptive peak to another. Since selection could not initiate this depar­ture from an ancestral peak, he called upon drift to carry the population into an unstable intermediary position, where it must either die, retreat, or be drawn rapidly by selection to a new stable position. Simpson felt that, with quantum evolution, he had carried his consistency argument to completion by showing that genetical models could encompass the most resistant and mysterious of all evolutionary events — the rapid origin of novel phenotypes at high taxonomic levels. Quantum evolution, he wrote, is “believed to be the dominant and most essential process in the origin of taxonomic units of relatively high rank, such as families, orders, and classes. It is believed to include circumstances that explain the mystery that hovers over the origins of such major groups” (p. 206). Simpson could, therefore, conclude: “The materials for evolution and the factors inducing and directing it are also believed to be the same at all levels and to differ in mega-evolution only in combination and in intensity” (p. 124).

Simpson's emphasis on quantum evolution underscores a central feature of his explanatory preferences in 1944 — his pluralistic view of evolutionary mechanisms. He wished to render all of macroevolution as the potential con­sequence of microevolutionary processes, not to rely dogmatically upon any single process. Although he favored selection leading to adaptation as a pri­mary theme, he explicitly denied that all evolution could be adaptive and un­der selective control. He concluded: “The aspects of tempo and mode that have now been discussed give little support to the extreme dictum that all evolution is primarily adaptive. Selection is a truly creative force and not solely negative in action. It is one of the crucial determinants of evolution, al­though under special circumstances it may be ineffective, and the rise of char­acters indifferent or even opposed to selection is explicable and does not con­tradict this usually decisive influence” (1944, p. 180).

When pressured for a new edition of Tempo and Mode, Simpson realized that evolutionary theory had developed too much in the intervening ten years to permit a reissue or even a simple revision. The field that he pioneered had stabilized and flourished: “It was [in the late 1930s] to me a new and exciting idea to try to apply population genetics to interpretation of the fossil record and conversely to check the broader validity of genetical theory and to extend its field by means of the fossil record. That idea is now a commonplace” (1953, p. ix). Thus, Simpson followed the outline of Tempo and Mode, but wrote a new book more than double the length of its ancestor — The Major Features of Evolution, published in 1953.

The two books differ in many ways (see p. 522 for my personal and professional introduction to the distinctions), most notably in Simpson's increasing confidence that selection within phyletic lineages must represent the only important cause of substantial change. Consider the following addition to the 1953 book, a speculative comment on trends in titanothere horns, with its prompt dismissal — tinged with impatience, if not incipient dogmatism — of the venerable argument that no evident function can be ascribed to the incipi­ent stages of useful structures: “This long seemed an extremely forceful argu­ment, but now it can be dismissed with little serious discussion. If a trend is advantageous at any point, even its earliest stages have some advantage. Thus if an animal butts others with its head, as titanotheres surely did, the slightest thickening as presage of later horns already reduced danger of fractures by however small an amount” (p. 270).

But the most dramatic difference between the two books lies in Simpson's demotion to insignificance of the concept that had formerly been, by his own reckoning and explicit announcement, his delight and greatest pride — quan­tum evolution. This hypothesis embodied the pluralism of his original ap­proach — a reliance on a range of genetical models. For he had advocated ge­netic drift to propel small populations off adaptive peaks into an ultimately untenable inadaptive phase. And he had explicitly christened quantum evolu­tion as a mode different in kind, not only in rate, from phyletic transforma­tion within lineages. But now, as the adaptationist program of the Synthesis hardened, Simpson decided that genetic drift could not trigger any major evo­lutionary event: “Genetic drift is certainly not involved in all or in most ori­gins of higher categories, even of very high categories such as classes or phyla” (p. 355).

In an “intermediate stage” of his personal ontogeny — his presentation to the Princeton conference on genetics, paleontology and evolution — Simpson (1949, p. 224) had emphasized the dominance of selection in quantum evolu­tion, while not denying other factors. But by 1953, he had completed his per­sonal transition. Quantum evolution now merits only four pages in an en­larged final chapter on modes of evolution. More importantly, this concept has now mutated to a meaning that Simpson had explicitly denied before: merely a name for phyletic evolution when the process operates at a maximal rate — an evolutionary tempo differing only in degree from the leisurely, grad­ual transformation of populations in ordinary geological time. Quantum evo­lution, he now writes, “is not a different sort of evolution from phyletic evo­lution, or even a distinctly different element of the total phylogenetic pattern. It is a special, more or less extreme and limiting case of phyletic evolution” (p. 389). He lists quantum evolution as one category among the four styles of phyletic evolution (p. 385) — with all four characterized by “the continuous maintenance of adaptation.” The bold hypothesis (1944) of an absolutely inadaptive phase has been replaced by the semantic notion of a relatively inadaptive phase (an intermediary stage inferior in design to either the ances­tral or the descendant Bauplan). But relative inadaptation poses no threat to the adaptationist paradigm. Even the strictest Darwinian will feel no Angst if the fit of phenotype to environment decreases for an intermediate form in a new habitat, relative to the ancestor in a different original place; (the two forms, after all, cannot directly compete). Even less Angst will then accom­pany an acknowledgment that this intermediate form may be less well de­signed than its own future descendant (for selection should engender increas­ing adaptation through time, especially as a population adjusts to a strikingly new environment). In short, such relatively inadaptive populations can only be regarded as adequately adapted to their own environments at their own time (unsubjected, as they must be, to competition with better adapted ances­tors in a different habitat, or with improved future descendants in this new world). Quantum evolution, by linguistic redefinition, therefore moves com­fortably under the umbrella of the adaptationist program. Simpson now even suggests that quantum evolution may be more rigidly controlled by selection than any other mode of evolution (though he still invokes inadaptation for the initial trigger): “Indeed the relatively rapid change in such a shift is more rigidly adaptive than are slower phases of phyletic change, for the direction and the rate of change result from strong selection pressure once the thresh­old is crossed” (p. 391).





MAYR AT THE INCEPTION (1942) AND CODIFICATION (1963):

SHIFTING FROM THE “GENETIC CONSISTENCY” TO THE “ADAPTATIONIST” PARADIGM





If we consider the synthesis as a fusion of three equally robust disciplines — experimental genetics, population genetics, and studies of natural history ex­pressed primarily by systematics (and not as an imposition of the first two, as modernisms, upon a hidebound, or even moribund, third mode of study) — then the role played by Mayr and other field naturalists in building the syn­thesis becomes fully constitutive and not only derivative. Mayr (1980), wear­ing his historian's hat, has strongly defended such an account of the Synthesis against the reductionist tradition that regards genetics as paramount, and the second phase of the Synthesis largely as a whipping of older disciplines into line. I do not deny Mayr's partisan motives in advancing this interpretation, but I also concur with his judgment.

Dobzhansky, as argued above, became the beacon of the second phase because he represented the only tradition, Russian genetics, that tried to fuse experimental Mendelism with systematics and natural history, rather than im­posing the first upon the second (or ignoring the second entirely). At Mayr's 1974 conference, Dobzhansky vividly recalled the impediments to synthe­sis within American traditions. He had originally left Russia to work with Thomas Hunt Morgan, America's premier experimental geneticist. Dobzhan­sky recalled Morgan's attitude to natural history:

“Naturalist” was a word almost of contempt with him, the antonym of “scientist.” Yet Morgan himself was an excellent naturalist, not only knowing animals and plants but aesthetically enjoying them . . . Morgan was profoundly skeptical about species as biological and evolutionary realities. The species problem simply did not interest him... Biology had to be strictly reductionistic. Biological phenomena had to be ex­plained in terms of chemistry and physics. Morgan himself knew little chemistry, but the less he knew the more he was fascinated by the powers he believed chemistry to possess. There was no surer way to impress him than to talk about biological phenomena in ostensibly chemical terms (1980, p. 446).



Morgan, Dobzhansky also remembered, “liked to say that genetics can be studied without any reference to evolution.” Could the Synthesis have taken root in such soil?

Dobzhansky brilliantly set a different task for evolutionary theory — an enterprise embodied in Darwin's title (but not treated as a major theme in his book), and emerging from traditions of systematics and natural history (while scarcely conceivable for someone with Morgan's, and to a large ex­tent Darwin's, views on the unreality of species): how can a theory originally constructed to describe continuous change in natural populations also ex­plain the discontinuous structure of nature's taxonomic diversity? The central problem of evolution, Dobzhansky asserted, is the origin of discontinuity among species.

This statement sounds commonplace today, but only because Dobzhansky and the Synthesis moved the question to center stage. Morgan and virtually all experimentalists had argued that the origin and nature of variation, and its manner of spread through populations, defined the key issues in evolutionary theory. Morgan disavowed the species problem as, at best, a hang-up of dull taxonomists and, at worst, a bogus issue because species have no reality in the flow of nature. (We name species, under this view, only because our poor minds can't handle continuity.)

Dobzhansky didn't deny the importance of Morgan's questions. But he argued that evolution operates on a series of levels, and that the primary gaze of natural history must not be focused upon these lower levels, but upon the broader phenomenon of the origin of species itself (Darwin's title, after all). Diversity represents the primary fact of nature (and the first topic of chapter 1 in Dobzhansky's book). Diversity arises by the splitting of lineages — that is by speciation. Speciation produces discontinuity in nature. How can a continu­ous process of genetic change yield such bounded separations? The origin of discontinuities between species must therefore be recast as the key problem in evolutionary theory. Only a naturalist (better yet, a trained systematist) could have reset the stage for synthesis in such a fruitful way.

The origin of hereditary variations is, however, only a part of the mechanism of evolution... These variations may be compared with building materials, but the presence of an unlimited supply of materials does not in itself give assurance that a building is going to be constructed ... Mu­tations and chromosomal changes are constantly arising at a finite rate, presumably in all organisms. But in nature we do not find a single greatly variable population of living beings which becomes more and more vari­able as time goes on; instead, the organic world is segregated into more than a million separate species, each of which possesses its own limited supply of variability which it does not share with the others... The ori­gin of species . . . constitutes a problem which is logically distinct from that of the origin of hereditary variation (Dobzhansky, 1937, p. 119).



Mayr (1942) then furthered Dobzhansky's program by dedicating an entire book to modes of speciation, and to realigning taxonomic practice with in­sights of the developing Synthesis. He even formulated his title in conscious parallel to Dobzhansky's (while both, of course, also claim and honor Dar­win) — and as a manifesto for the centrality of his field: Systematics and the Origin of Species. Mayr's first paragraph (1942, p. 3) sets his theme and tone:

The rise of genetics during the first thirty years of this century had a rather unfortunate effect on the prestige of systematics. The spectacular success of experimental work in unraveling the principles of inheritance and the obvious applicability of these results in explaining evolution have tended to push systematics into the background. There was a ten­dency among laboratory workers to think rather contemptuously of the museum man, who spent his time counting hairs or drawing bristles, and whose final aim seemed to be merely the correct naming of his speci­mens. A welcome improvement in the mutual understanding between ge­neticists and systematists has occurred in recent years.



Mayr (1942) follows the characteristic pluralism of the early synthesis in listing all valid evolutionary principles that can explain the data of systemat­ics. His major aim therefore follows the program of “healthy restriction” — the focus of the first phase of the Synthesis (see pp. 503–508). Thus, Mayr explicitly rejects such fallacies as Larmackian inheritance, and the idea that higher taxa arise by different and mysterious routes — thereby invoking an ar­gument by elimination to make evolutionary change at all levels fully consis­tent with principles of genetics at work in modern populations and subject to experiment in the laboratory or observation in the field. Whereas Mayr's ma­jor themes remain Darwinian, he still invokes the full panoply of legitimate genetic forces. Note in particular that selection (leading to adaptation), while listed first, represents only one force in an array collectively responsible for the formation of species. Adaptation holds no exclusivity, or even any partic­ular pride of place: “First, there is available in nature an almost unlimited supply of various kinds of mutations. Second, the variability within the small­est taxonomic units has the same genetic basis as the differences between the subspecies, species, and higher categories. And third, selection, random gene loss, and similar factors, together with isolation, make it possible to ex­plain species formation on the basis of mutability, without any recourse to Lamarckian forces” (1942, p. 70).

Mayr reemphasizes this pluralistic theme at the end of his book in asserting the essential integrative claim that all phenomena of macroevolution can also be subsumed by the Synthesis. Inclusion within the Synthesis implies explana­tion by principles of modern genetics, not a commitment to any particular mode of genetic change: “It is feasible to interpret the findings and generali­zations of the macroevolutionists on the basis of the known genetic facts (random mutation) without recourse to any other intrinsic factors” (1942, p. 292). Mayr then lists the eight key principles of modern genetics that he re­gards as necessary for accomplishing the integration. Only one, number seven on the list, mentions selection and adaptation (p. 293).

As a more positive argument against adaptationist exclusivity, Mayr's own taxonomy of “factors involved in speciation” (p. 216) grants explicit and equal weight to adaptation and nonadaptation as the two primary categories of divergence. He writes (p. 216): “We may classify these factors as (1) those that either produce or eliminate discontinuities and (2) those that promote or impede divergence. The latter may be subdivided further into adaptive (selec­tion) and non-adaptive factors.”

Within this important category of nonadaptation, Mayr includes many prominent phenomena that he would later ascribe to selection.





1. Nearly all polymorphism within species:

There is, however, considerable indirect evidence that most of the characters that are involved in polymorphism are completely neutral, as far as survival value is concerned. There is, for example, no reason to believe that the presence or absence of a band on a snail shell would be a notice­able selective advantage or disadvantage. Among the many species of birds, which occur in several clear-cut color phases, there is, with one or two exceptions, no evidence for selective mating or any other advantage of any of the phases (p. 75).





2. Most geographic variation in clines:

It is difficult to see why the gradual decrease from the north to the south in the number of the bridled individuals (ringvia) in populations of the Atlantic murre (Uria aalge) should have an adaptational significance ... The convergent development in several species of Draco also seems to belong to the category of non-adaptive clines (p. 96).





3. Much geographic variation in general:

It should not be assumed that all the differences between populations and species are purely adaptational and that they owe their existence to their superior selective qualities... Many combinations of color pat­terns, spots, and bands, as well as extra bristles and wing veins, are prob­ably largely accidental. This is particularly true in regions with many sta­tionary, small, and well-isolated populations, such as we find commonly in tropical and insular species... We must stress the point that not all-geographic variation is adaptive (p. 86).



Mayr's later book (1963) expanded to more than twice the number of pages, and became even more weighty in its assurances. This work shaped my own evolutionary thinking more than any other book — and I am confident that most naturalists of my generation would offer the same testimony. As I reread Animal Species and Evolution in preparing to write this chapter — and examined my old marginalia, pencilled in preparation for the deciding oral exam of my Ph.D. program — I came to appreciate even more (now that I know the genre's difficulty through personal experience) the enormous labor and creative thought involved in bringing so much material together. And I finally understood the defining word that once puzzled me in Julian Huxley's review of Mayr's book — “magisterial.” (The etymological source does not re­side in “magnificent” or “majestic,” though Mayr's book surely merits either of these accolades, but in magister, the Latin word for teacher. A great magister is not a schoolroom pedant, but a wise preceptor who holds mastery within his teaching authority, or magisterium. Magisterial, above all else, means authoritative. And to what greater virtue, after all, may an author aspire?)

Although Mayr's 1963 book covers the same general material, and in simi­lar order, as the 1942 version, the works differ profoundly, and Mayr chose a new title (just as Simpson had done in noting the changes between his 1944 and 1953 volumes). I would specify two thematic changes as most important.

1. The primary role of geographic isolation as a sine qua non, and the consequent near universality of allopatric speciation, has consistently formed the centerpiece of Mayr's worldview. But, in 1942, pure continuationism reigned. Populations split into roughly equal divisions and each subgroup then func­tioned as a microcosm of the ancestral mass — as in the model now called “dumb-bell allopatry” and considered (by Mayr at least) both rare and rela­tively ineffective in producing new species. In other words, Mayr (1942) orig­inally identified no distinctive properties promoting speciation in certain kinds of isolated populations vs. others. Isolation itself, and the severing of gene flow, rendered any population ripe for speciation: “The big gaps which we find between species are preceded by the little gaps which we find between subspecies and by the still lesser gaps which we find between populations. Of course, if these populations are distributed as a complete continuum, there are no gaps. But with the least isolation, the first minor gaps will appear” (1942, p. 159).

But by 1963, Mayr had developed the full apparatus of the distinctive the­ory that he later called “peripatric speciation” to emphasize a sharp separa­tion from his original, continuationist version of allopatry. For the peripatric model promotes the role of small populations, isolated at the periphery of pa­rental ranges, and subject to a special maelstrom of influences including greatly enhanced selection and random effects of the founder principle — all leading to potential achievement of specific status with relative speed by a “genetic revolution.” Mayr says (personal communication) that he intro­duced this new apparatus in a paper (1954) that achieved no impact, but nonetheless represents his most important idea and best work. (Nihil sub sole novum. He published this paper in a symposium volume — the greatest reposi­tory of unread literature, both then and now.)

2. Mayr's 1942 book included little explicit material about adaptation, since this volume emphasized the origin and development of discontinuity be­tween species, and said little about anagenetic change within populations. This context of minimal consideration reflects Mayr's pluralism and lack of commitment to strict adaptationism at this time. (This claim may sound para­doxical, but should not be so read. Views expressed in passing — by their sim­ple acknowledgment of an unchallenged belief — tend to record a professional consensus more clearly than material explicitly touted as central and distinc­tive.) But, in 1963, Mayr added a full consideration of variation and change within populations — the main reason for a much longer book. Here the hard­ened, panadaptationist position of the later Synthesis reigns supreme, per­haps more strongly than in any other book of comparable influence.

In the mid 1990's, Mayr himself (in lift, and personal communications — see end of this section), while continuing to explicate and defend his favored themes of 1963, denies any substantial change between the volumes of 1942 and 1963 on questions of adaptation. This difference between current mem­ory and textual record, previously discussed as a general principle (see p. 521), provides a fascinating illustration of how scholars can slowly and un­consciously imbibe a shifting professional consensus, thus imposing a subjec­tive and personal impression of stability upon a virtual transmogrification. I find this unconscious alteration all the more ironic in Mayr's case because his first category of major change in ideas about speciation — his intellectual move from the dumbbell to the peripatric model — so strongly encourages a widened space for nonadaptationist themes (for many evolutionists have interpreted his notions of genetic revolutions and founder effects in small peripheral isolates as a powerful antidote to the classical panadaptationist model of Fisherian panmixia in large populations). Yet Mayr never translated the implications of these changes in his own ideas about speciation into doubts about adaptation in his chapters on variation and change within pop­ulations.

No good naturalist, living in our complex universe of relative frequencies, could ever become an uncompromising dogmatist on the subject of adapta­tion. Mayr therefore mentions occasional inadaptive features (1963, p. 156), or acknowledges the importance of developmental constraint (p. 608). But these statements function more as footnotes or placeholders in the logic of an argument; for Mayr does not treat alternatives to adaptation as operational imperatives in the ordinary analysis of cases. Moreover, Mayr laces his plu­ralistic admissions with hedges and caveats. Note, for example, how Mayr frames his main admission of potential nonadaptation only as an argument against optimality, not as a denial of selection — and how his closing hedge anticipates a movement of even these least promising cases into the adaptationist camp:

Each local population is the product of a continuing selection process. By definition, then, the genotype of each local population has been se­lected for the production of a well-adapted phenotype. It does not follow from this conclusion, however, that every detail of the phenotype is max­imally adaptive. If a given subspecies of ladybird beetles has more spots on the elytra than another subspecies, it does not necessarily mean that the extra spots are essential for survival in the range of that subspecies. It merely means that the genotype that has evolved in this area as the result of selection develops additional spots on the elytra ... Yet close analysis often reveals unsuspected adaptive qualities even in minute details of the phenotype (1963, p. 311).



Selection holds primacy of place as the ruling force of evolution: “Every species is the product of a long history of selection and is thus well adapted to the environment in which it lives. There is no doubt that the phenotype as a whole, including its physiological properties, is adaptive and is produced by a genotype that is the result of natural selection. This is not contradicted by the fact that an occasional component of the phenotype is adaptively irrelevant” (1963, p. 60).

Above all else, Mayr regards one conclusion as especially well confirmed by observation: adaptation rules in “every local population” as selection to “exacting requirements” of local environments produces an “optimal pheno­type.” One could hardly state the adaptationist position more boldly: “One conclusion emerges from these observations more strongly than any other: every local population is very precisely adjusted in its phenotype to the exact­ing requirements of the local environment. This adjustment is the result of a selection of genes producing an optimal phenotype” (1963, p. 318).

Mayr's treatment of potential alternatives illustrates his adherence to the rule of adaptation, both as a methodological preference and an empirical claim. Geographic trends that he formerly attributed to incidental allometries have now become active adaptations: “A particularly impressive result of studies of ecogeographical rules is the discovery of the extreme sensitivity of body proportions to natural selection. The former belief that proportions are determined by 'built-in' allometry factors and change automatically with changes in body size is not supported by these findings” (1963, p. 324).

Neutral genes become improbable, almost nonsensical in principle, once we recognize the pervasive monitoring of nature by selection:

Entirely neutral genes are improbable for physiological reasons. Every gene elaborates a “gene product,” a chemical that enters the develop­mental stream. It seems unrealistic to me to assume that the nature of the particular chemical (enzyme or other product) should be without any ef­fect whatsoever on the fitness of the ultimate phenotype. A gene may be selectively neutral when placed on a particular genetic background in a particular temporary physical and biotic environment. However, genetic background as well as environment change continually in natural populations and I consider it therefore exceedingly unlikely that any gene will remain selectively neutral for any length of time (1963, p. 207).



Consequently, even the most apparently trivial features probably origi­nated by direct selection. “One can never assert with confidence that a given structure does not have selective significance. The peculiar tarsal combs of the males in certain species of Drosophila turned out to have an important func­tion during copulation; the color patterns of Cepaea snails have cryptic sig­nificance, mitigating predator pressure” (1963, p. 190).

In 1963, Mayr repudiated all three major classes of nonadaptation that he had defended in 1942: polymorphisms, clines, and much geographic varia­tion in general. Explicitly refuting his own former view, Mayr now argues (1963, p. 162) that the ubiquity of selection must imply an adaptive basis for polymorphisms (see also pp. 158 and 167): “Such neutral polymorphism, it was claimed, was maintained by 'accident.' Now that the cryptic physiologi­cal effects of 'neutral' genes have been discovered, it is evident that such genes are anything but selectively neutral. It is altogether unlikely that two genes would have identical selective values under all the conditions in which they may coexist in a population.”

In a remarkable statement, he then urges that polymorphisms and clines be viewed as evidence for adaptation a priori: “Selective neutrality can be ex­cluded almost automatically wherever polymorphism or character clines are found in natural populations . . . Virtually every case quoted in the past as caused by genetic drift due to errors of sampling has more recently been rein­terpreted in terms of selection pressures” (1963, pp. 207-208).

As for geographic variation, what else could such a phenomenon represent but adaptation to an altered environment, with selection as an efficient and omnipresent watchdog: “The geographic variation of species is the inevitable consequence of the geographic variation of the environment. A species must adapt itself in different parts of its range to the demands of the local environ­ment. Every local population is under continuous selection pressure for maxi­mal fitness in the particular area where it occurs... Each local environment exerts a continuous selection pressure on the localized demes of every species and models them thereby into adaptedness” (1963, pp. 311-312).

Throughout Mayr's 1963 book — with a cadence that sounds, at times, almost like a morality play — phenomenon after phenomenon falls to the explanatory unity of adaptation, as the light of nature's truth expands into previous darkness: non-genetic variation (p. 139), homeostasis (pp. 57, 61), prevention of hybridization (p. 109). Former standard bearers of the opposi­tion fall into disarray, finally succumbing to defeat almost by definition: “It is now evident that the term 'drift' was ill-chosen and that all or virtually all of the cases listed in the literature as 'evolutionary change due to genetic drift' are to be interpreted in terms of selection” (p. 214). All particular Goliaths have been slain (although later genetic studies would revivify this particular old warrior): “The human blood-group genes have in the past been held up as an exemplary case of 'neutral genes,' that is, genes of no selective significance. This assumption has now been thoroughly disproved” (p. 161).

However, Mayr's most interesting expression of movement towards a hardened adaptationism occurs not so much in these explicit claims for near ubiquity, but even more forcefully in the subtle redefinition of all evolutionary problems as issues in adaptation. The very meaning of terms, questions, groupings and weights of phenomena, now enter evolutionary discourse un­der adaptationist presumptions. Not only have alternatives to adaptation been routed on an objective playing field, Mayr claims in 1963, but the con­ceptual space of evolutionary inquiry has also become so reconfigured that hardly any room (or even language) remains for considering, or even formu­lating, a potential way to consider answers outside an adaptationist frame­work.

Major subjects, the origin of evolutionary novelty for example, now reside exclusively within an adaptationist framework by purely functional defini­tion: “We may begin by defining evolutionary novelty as any newly acquired structure or property that permits the performance of a new function, which, in turn, will open a new adaptive zone” (p. 602). In a world of rapid and pre­cise adaptation, morphological similarity between distantly related groups can only arise through convergence imposed by similar adaptive regimes upon fundamentally different genetic material. The older, internalist view (constraint-based and potentially nonadaptationist) — the claim that we might attribute such similarities to parallelism produced by homologous genes — is dismissed as both old-fashioned and wrong-headed. (In modern hindsight, this claim provides a particularly compelling example of how hardened adaptationism can suppress interesting questions — for such homologues have now been found in abundance. Their discovery ranks as one of the most important events in modern evolutionary science — see Chapter 10, p. 1092, where we will revisit this particular Mayrian claim): “In the early days of Mendelism there was much search for homologous genes that would account for such similarities. Much that has been learned about gene physiol­ogy makes it evident that the search for homologous genes is quite futile ex­cept in very close relatives” (1963, p. 609).

Subjects that might have seemed challenging or exceptional now achieve a place within the adaptationist framework by expanded definition. Nonfunc­tional pleiotropic consequences, for example, become an aspect of orthodoxy because they now enter a hardened discourse in the redefined guise of features subsidiary to a main effect of adaptive significance. (I do not challenge the particular assertion in this case, but I do feel that such an important subject deserves consideration from a structuralist perspective as well): “Pleiotropic gene action is the key to the solution of many other puzzling phenomena ... Color, pattern, or some structural detail may be merely an incidental by-prod­uct of a gene maintained in the gene pool for other physiological properties. The curious evolutionary success of seemingly insignificant characters now appears in a new light” (1963, p. 162).

All potential anomalies yield to a more complex selectionist scenario, often presented as a “just-so-story.” Why did the crown height of molars increase so slowly, if hypsodonty became so advantageous once horses shifted to vegetational regimes of newly evolved grasses with high silica content? Mayr devises a story — sensible, though empirically wrong in this case — and regards such a hypothetical claim for plausibility as an adequate reason to affirm a selectionist cause. (The average increase may have been as small as the figure cited by Mayr, but horses did not change in anagenetic continuity at constant rates. Horses probably evolved predominantly by punctuated equilibrium — see Prothero and Shubin, 1989, and Chapter 9. The average of a millimeter per million years represents a meaningless amalgam of geological moments of rapid change during speciation mixed with long periods of stasis): “An in­crease in tooth length (hypsodonty) was of selective advantage to primitive horses shifting from browsing to grazing in an increasingly arid environment. However, such a change in feeding habits required a larger jaw and stronger jaw muscles, hence a bigger and heavier skull supported by heavier neck mus­cles, as well as shifts in the intestinal tract. Too rapid an increase in tooth length was consequently opposed by selection, and indeed the increase aver­aged only about 1 millimeter per million years” (1963, p. 238).

In 1991, I asked Ernst Mayr about changes between his 1942 and 1963 books. He acknowledged the structural alterations, of course — particularly his addition of several chapters emphasizing adaptational themes. But he strongly denied any personal augmentation of adaptationist preferences through the intervening years, citing the interesting argument that, as a Lamarckian in his evolutionary youth (well before both books), he had al­ways favored adaptationism. He even wrote me a fascinating letter the day af­ter our lunchtime conversation:





Dear Steve,

I gave considerable thought to your question how my 1963 book differed from the 1942 one, and why adaptation was so much more fea­tured in the later volume. I think I now have the answer.

Remember that I consider evolution by and large to consist of two processes: 1) the maintenance and improvement of adaptedness, and 2) the origin and development of diversity.

Since (2) was so almost totally ignored by the pre-Synthesis geneticists, I focussed in 1942 on (2). By the 1950s the study of diversity had been fully admitted to evolutionary biology, owing to the efforts of Dobzhansky, myself, Rensch and Stebbins, and in my 1963 book I could devote a good deal of attention to (1). This was rather easy because, as you know, I used to be a Lamarckian. And Lamarckians are adaptationists. Hence, it is not that from 1942 to 1963 I had become an adaptationist, rather I reconciled in 1963 my adaptationist inclination with the Darwinian mechanism (Letter of December 20, 1991).





(Mayr then added a handwritten footnote, demoting to insignificance the one subject for which he did acknowledge a reversal of opinion between the two books: “Neutral polymorphism is an infinitesimal percentage of all evolu­tionary phenomena. Don't make a mountain out of this little mole-hill.”)

I do not deny Mayr's stable adaptationist preferences (through his ontogenetic change in explanatory preferences from Lamarck to Darwin). This personal stability provides an even better reason for regarding as important, and therefore generally indicative, the textual evidence of transition from plu­ralism in 1942 to adaptationist hardening in 1963 (for Mayr's 1942 text may therefore, by implications of his own testimony, be reporting the conven­tional pluralistic wisdom of the time despite Mayr's own personal preference for adaptationism). On the subject of adaptation — not the major concern of either book (for both treat speciation and the production of diversity as their primary topics) — Mayr recorded a professional consensus both times, largely passively I suspect (hence his personal inattention to the alteration). Scientists must struggle to identify and understand these influences of “shared culture,” for such a “background” consensus fuels the sources of unconscious bias for each of us at every moment of our careers.





WHY HARDENING?





I have documented the adaptationist hardening of the Modern Synthesis in some detail, but I have not addressed an obvious and pressing question: why did this conceptual trend occur? Several aspects of an answer seem clear, but I can offer no full or satisfying resolution.

The culture of science trains us to believe that such major shifts of empha­sis record improvements in knowledge won by empirical research and discov­ery. I do not deny that observation did play a significant role, at least in il­lustrating, with some elegant examples, the power of adaptation. Consider, for example, the “ecological genetics” of E. B. Ford and his panselectionist school in England. Their commitment to adaptationist explanations of effec­tively all variation among populations, and their documentation of strong selection coefficients in nature, buoyed the strict Darwinian faith. Dobzhansky's own empirical work increased his belief in the power of selection. In 1937, he tended to attribute chromosomal inversion frequencies in natural populations of Drosophila to genetic drift, but he then discovered that these frequencies fluctuate in a regular and repeatable way from season to season, and he therefore decided (with evident justice) that such systematic and iter­ated change must be adaptive.

But empirical discovery cannot supply the entire (or even, I think, the major) reason for adaptationist hardening, for each favorable case can be matched by a failure (often hedged or unacknowledged), and no adequate as­sessment of an overall relative frequency has ever been achieved — to this day. Thus, any judgment, in either direction, must represent the fashionable impo­sition of a few well-documented cases upon an unstudied plethora. For exam­ple, A. J. Cain and colleagues did win a major victory for adaptation by showing that banding-morph frequencies in the land snail Cepaea, a former mainstay for claims about genetic drift, reflected selection based upon visual predation by birds, and upon climatic factors (Cain and Sheppard, 1950, 1952, 1954).

But Cain and his colleagues then recognized and named the outstand­ing pattern of “area effects” (Cain and Currey, 1963a and b) — abrupt geo­graphic changes in banding-morph frequencies occurring with no perceptible alteration in any environmental factor that might impose a selection pressure. In what can only be labeled an article of faith, Cain attributed area effects to selection based upon “cryptic [meaning truly unmeasured and unperceived by any investigator, not merely subtle] environmental differences” — a re­markable affirmation of an a priori preference based upon not finding the necessary empirical confirmation. Good evidence has since been presented for a non-adaptive explanation of area effects as historical remnants of previous patterns in land use, and not as an outcome of current regimes in selection (Cameron et ah, 1980; see review of the entire case in Gould and Woodruff, 1990). (Area effects rank as anomalies under selectionist presuppositions — hence Cain's need to supply an orthodox adaptationist explanation, even in the absence of required evidence. Under a “legacy of history” explanation, such discordance of morphology with present geography presents no anom­aly and need not even receive a special name.)

If adaptationist hardening cannot be explained as simply and empiri­cally driven, we might turn to historical and sociological themes. Smocovitis (1996), as previously mentioned (see p. 503), presents the intriguing thesis that renewed optimism following the wreckage of World War II (including the hope inspired by the newly constituted United Nations) launched a strong push for scientific defenses of potential human improvement and evolution­ary progress — an impetus that became a semi-official movement spurred by positivistic theories of knowledge proffered as antidotes for older irrationalisms. Smocovitis writes:

If selection had enough agency (and at the same time were a mechanical principle) then all the more rapid and possible the “improvement” of humans... More strongly selectionist models would be favored by biolo­gists who modelled themselves after physicists at the same time they pointed the way to the “improvement” of humanity and painted a pro­gressive and optimistic picture of the world . . . Evolutionary models fa­voring random genetic drift, which enforced a stochastic view of evolu­tion — and culture — would not be favored in a post-war frame of mind seeking to “improve” the world. So powerful would be the need for a progressive and selectionist framework in the 1940's that even Dobzhansky and Wright were to adopt more strongly selectionist models.*



Some complex mixture of empirical and sociological themes may explain the adaptationist hardening of the synthesis, but we must not neglect the ad­ditional impetus of a cultural analog to drift and founder effects in small pop­ulations. The community of evolutionary biologists is sufficiently small, and sufficiently stratified — a few lead and many follow, as in most human activi­ties — that we need not necessarily invoke some deep and general scientific or societal trend to explain a change in opinion by a substantial community of evolutionists in different nations. A reassessment by a few key people, bound in close contact and mutual influence, might trigger a general response. The three leading exponents of hardening in America — Dobzhansky, Simpson, and Mayr — worked together as colleagues in a “New York Mafia” centered at Columbia University and the American Museum of Natural History. Add another seemingly eternal principle of human affairs — that founders tend to be brilliant and subtle, and to keep all major difficulties constantly in mind, while epigones generally promulgate the faith and disregard, or never learn, the problems, exceptions, and nuances — and we may then wish to view the adaptationist hardening as ultimately inadaptive for the broadest goal of understanding evolution aright. Bandwagons might well be construed as cul­tural analogs of internalist drives in nonfunctional orthogenesis. Theories can grow tired. Theories can also harden and lose their bearings when compla­cency occupies the driver's seat.





Hardening on the Other Two Legs of the Darwinian Tripod





To illustrate the hardening of the Modern Synthesis, I have documented its most significant ontogenetic trend in extenso — increasingly exclusive empha­sis on adaptation as the sign of natural selection's pervasive power. But if we epitomize the Synthesis as Darwinism reclothed in Mendelian understanding, then, following this book's focal argument that the minimal commitments of Darwinian logic encompass three central themes, the other two legs of this essential tripod should experience corresponding changes as the Synthesis hardened. I will not provide so extensive a discussion of these other legs — levels of selection and extrapolation into geological time — but I do wish to record that the literature of these subjects also experienced the same ontogeny of solidi­fication (and unjustified neglect of reasonable alternatives).





LEVELS OF SELECTION





Darwin, as we have seen (pp. 125–137), viewed organisms as nearly exclusive agents of selection — for deep reasons situated at the core of both the logic (the invisible hand of Adam Smith transferred to nature) and the psychology (the inversion of Paley's world) of his theory. But few Darwinians grasped the rationale or centrality of this principle, and a tradition of vagueness and loose thinking about levels of selection developed. Some, like R. A. Fisher, rode Darwin's wave and wrote explicitly and cogently about reasons for choosing individual organisms as the proper locus, and for disregarding, as effectively impotent, other levels that must be deemed conceivable in theory (1958, on species selection — see my critique of Fisher on pp. 644–652). But others, dat­ing back to A. R. Wallace himself (see pp. 131–132), never understood the full logic and implications of this issue, and ranged indiscriminately up and down potential levels, without grasping the theoretical problems entailed by such excursions.

Thus, a fluid situation prevailed on this issue at the time of the Darwinian centennial celebrations of 1959 — my point of reference for the triumphal height of the Modern Synthesis in its strongly adaptationist version. Adapta­tion had become all the rage, but vagueness shrouded the key issue of selec­tion's focus and level — and for two reasons.

First, and less important because the position attracted few supporters, a few evolutionists explicitly advocated a multi-level view of both selection and adaptation. A group of Chicago ecologists, authors of an important text­book known by its acronym of AEPPS (Allee, Emerson, Park, Park and Schmidt, Principles of Animal Ecology, 1949), generated and led this small movement. Emerson spoke at the Chicago centennial symposium, and pre­sented his multilevel view in both content and title: “The evolution of adap­tation in population systems.”

Emerson begins by acknowledging the conventional Darwinian preference for individual organisms (and reminding us that he will not neglect this usual argument). But he then stakes his higher claim: “It is my intention in this es­say to emphasize the evolution of adaptation in population systems without, however, negating the data or the major interpretations of the roles of indi­viduals in evolutionary history or processes” (1960, p. 307).

I find Emerson's article frustrating, for his arguments are so reasonable in some places, and so very wrong, to the point of illogic, in others. On the one hand, he presents a defendable and properly philosophical criterion for higher-level selection based on features of populations that cannot be expli­cated as additive results of organismal properties — in other words, “emer­gent” characters. He correctly defines a population ripe for selection at its own level as “an inclusive entity with emergent characteristics that tran­scend the summation of the attributes of the component individuals” (1960, p. 307).

But, having legitimately defined the problem, he then launches into an almost rhapsodic, and simply illogical, claim that almost anything with defin­able boundaries can be recognized as a unit of natural selection: “Natural selection operates at each level of integration from the gene and complex polygenic characters within the individual, to the whole individual, and to various levels of intraspecific population systems and interspecific inter-adapted community systems and ecosystems” (1960, p. 340).

This argument can be defended in theory so long as the higher unit oper­ates as an interactor with surrounding environments and remains in a genea­logical nexus engaged in differential reproduction (see Chapter 8). But how can Darwinian selection possibly operate directly on an ecosystem? However we may choose to define such an entity, ecosystems do not mate and do not produce children (see Chapter 8, pp. 597–613 on criteria of Darwinian indi­viduality). No argument can be made about their differential reproductive success, and no Darwinian calculus can therefore be applied to their history through time.

Emerson doesn't seem to grasp that selection works by differential reproductive success, not by design for immediate, self-serving utility: “It would be extremely difficult,” he writes (1960, p. 319), “to explain the evolution of the uterus and mammary glands in mammals or the nest-building instincts of birds as the result of natural selection of the fittest individual.” But if milk-rich mammary glands promote the survival of offspring, then the mother acts in her own Darwinian interest. In short, Emerson's paper gives us an unin­tended insight into the confusing lack of definition that natural selection has always suffered, even at the moment of its greatest explicit influence.

Second — and more important in its virtual ubiquity — leading evolutionists, though well aware that orthodoxy identified individual organisms as the fo­cus of selection, did not grasp the logical necessity or centrality of such a claim in Darwinian theory, and therefore often indulged in vague, perhaps unconscious, and often fuzzy, statements about the efficacy of higher levels. (I say “fuzzy” because most of these claims about populations and groups only invoked the non-emergent effects of organismic characters — and therefore do not necessarily qualify as valid statements about higher-level selection. I don't think that many evolutionists had properly formulated this crucial issue at the time.)

Dobzhansky, for example (1957, p. 392), states that selection operates on organisms, but then proposes that such phenomena as heterozygote advan­tage might record some populational “extra” in exposing the reduced fitness of homozygotes as a kind of organismic sacrifice “for” the group: “Natural selection operates through differential survival and differential fertility of individuals, and yet at some times brings about such forms of integration of the gene pool of the population which lead to the sacrifice of some of the indi­vidual members of the population. The phenomenon of balanced polymor­phism, with highly fit heterozygotes contrasting with less fit homozygotes, is one of such forms of genetic integration of Mendelian populations.”

Mayr's most authoritative book (1963) provides an excellent illustration of organismic orthodoxy amidst statements, lacking clear definition, about se­lection at higher levels. Mayr surely recognizes the usual form of proper Dar­winian argument — that apparent benefits to populations should be ex­plained, whenever possible, as effects of selection upon organisms: “The solution usually proposed for the difficulty raised by the conflict between a benefit for the individual and one for the population is to make the popula­tion rather than the individual the unit of selection.... It would seem prefera­ble to search for solutions based on the selective advantage of individual ge­notypes, such as Fisher's explanation of an even sex ratio” (1963, pp. 198-199).

In rereading Mayr's 1963 book with the hindsight of thirty years, however, I was struck by the number of passages and arguments that either speak loosely about explicit advantages to groups and populations (rather than for­tuitous beneficial effects arising as side consequences of selection on organ­isms), or seem to state an explicit claim for selection at the population level. Most of these statements focus on the virtues of genetic variability. Mayr asks (1963, p. 158): “Why are not all individuals of a population identical in ap­pearance? Is it because diversity is of selective advantage to the population?” He then argues (1963, p. 308) that the primary function of chromosomal variation lies in the flexibility thus accorded to populations: “They appear to have, as primary function, either the increase of adaptability and adaptedness of these populations through balanced polymorphism of entire chromosome sections or the regulation of the amount of recombination.” In fact, Mayr's main justification for regarding polymorphism as adaptive — a major shift in his own adaptationist hardening from the examples used to support non-selectionist claims in his 1942 book — focuses on advantages to populations (1963, p. 251).

Polymorphism is based on and produced by definite genetic mechanisms, such as genes for differential niche selection and the heterosis of heterozygotes. A population that has not responded to selection for such mech­anisms and therefore lacks polymorphic diversity is more narrowly adapted, more specialized, and therefore more vulnerable to extermina­tion. The widespread occurrence of genetic mechanisms that produce and maintain polymorphism is directly due to selection and is in itself a component of adaptiveness. It seems appropriate, therefore, to speak of “adaptive polymorphism.”



A rally around the flag of organismic selection, and an explicit (and vociferous) denial of higher levels, became a major movement in evolutionary theory during the 1960's. The hardening of adaptationism had occurred largely during the 1940's and 1950's (in time for the Darwinian centennial of 1959); but the refinement of adaptationist arguments to nearly exclusive operation at the organismic level followed later. This reform* emerged largely within the field of animal behavior, where the ethological tradition, particularly in the work of Konrad Lorenz, had long promulgated a loose and largely unconsidered approach to multilevel selection.

The primary impetus to explicit debate appeared with the publication, in 1962, of V. C. Wynne-Edwards's Animal Dispersion in Relation to Social Behavior. Since most evolutionists now regard Wynne-Edwards's primary argument as wrong (and I do not dispute this consensus), we greatly undervalue his work and misconstrue its importance. Most evolutionists today, many of who have never read Wynne-Edwards, know his book only by reputation as a dumb argument for group selection that George Williams and others thoroughly demolished. I regard this assessment as entirely unfair. Wynne-Edwards's claim for group selection may be wrong, but I can cite few other theories, presented within evolutionary biology during my career, that could be deemed so challenging in implication, so comprehensive in claims, so fasci­nating in extension, and so thought-provoking.

First of all, and essential for grasping the book's sweep, “Animal Disper­sion” presents a theory about organic self-regulation of population numbers, not primarily an argument for group selection in general (although group se­lection serves as a fundamental feature of the proposed mechanism). Wynne-Edwards begins, as so many others have done (including Darwin), with an analogy to human institutions. When predators show no restraint in the midst of plenty, ecosystems may crumble as both predators and prey suc­cumb. He speaks with feeling about the collapse of Arctic whaling (1962, p. 5): “The stocks of the two right whales have never recovered, and the pop­ulation of Greenland-whaling men and of those who ministered to them has become effectively extinct.”

Wynne-Edwards then generalizes from carnivory to food-based limitation in any kind of eating, and to the transcendent need for regulating population sizes of consumers in any ecosystem. I am fascinated that Wynne-Edwards, in this statement, invokes the same, largely metaphysical, argument that Darwin proposed in specifying a summum bonum for the construction of nature (a situation established by very different mechanisms in Wynne-Edwards's and Darwin's systems): the old principle of plenitude, or maximization of the kinds and numbers of organisms in any given segment of earthly real estate (see p. 229 for Darwin's version):

The need for restraint in the midst of plenty, as it turns out, must apply to all animals whose numbers are ultimately limited by food whether they are predators in the ordinary sense of the word or not... Where we can still find nature undisturbed by human interference, whether un­der some stable climax of vegetation or proceeding through a natural succession, there is generally no indication whatever that the habitat is run down or destructively overtaxed. On the contrary the whole trend of ecological evolution seems to be in the very opposite direction, leading towards the highest state of productivity that can possibly be built up within the limitations set by the inorganic environment. Judging by appearances, chronic over-exploitation and mass poverty intrude them­selves on a mutually-balanced and thriving natural world only as a kind of adventitious disease, almost certain to be swiftly suppressed by natu­ral selection. It is easy to appreciate that if each species maintains an optimum population-density on its own account, not only will it be pro­viding the most favorable conditions for its own survival, but it will au­tomatically offer the best possible living to species higher up the chain that depend on it in turn for food. Such prima facie argument leads to the conclusion that it must be highly advantageous to survival, and thus strongly favored by selection, for animal species (1) to control their own population-densities, and (2) to keep them as near as possible to the opti­mum level for each habitat they occupy (1962, pp. 8-9).



In Darwinism, this regulation proceeds by a fundamentally Malthusian method — imposed from outside by a hecatomb on populations that outstrip resources. Wynne-Edwards holds that such an indirect and inefficient mode of external imposition wreaks havoc upon ecosystems, and that existing sta­bilities therefore imply the operation of an entirely different system for regu­lating populations — internally, by complex sets of behaviors that limit re­production and match population sizes to appropriate resources. Since the Darwinian imperative leads organisms to maximize their own reproductive success, such internal limitation can only be achieved by mechanisms of group selection powerful enough to counteract the personal gains of individ­ual organisms from conventional Darwinian selection.

The ingenuity of Wynne-Edwards's theory lies largely in the range of behavioral phenomena that he interprets as devices evolved by group selection for limitation of population size. In fact, Wynne-Edwards ascribes the origin of social organization itself to this need for limitation upon the size of popu­lations. Note that by “conventional competition” he does not mean the ver­nacular “orthodox” or “ordinary” (which would then become Darwinian, or the opposite of his personal intention), but rather apparent competition by bluff, ritual and display — convention in this sense — rather than actual (and potentially destructive) fighting:

Undisguised contest for food inevitably leads in the end to overexploitation, so that a conventional goal for competition has to be evolved in its stead; and it is precisely in this — surprising though it may appear at first sight — that social organization and the primitive seeds of all social behavior have their origin ... Putting the situation the other way around, a society can be denned for our purposes as an organization ca­pable of providing conventional competition: this, at least, appears to be its original, most primitive function, which indeed survives more or less thinly veiled even in the civilized societies of man (1962, p. 14).



Almost all the rich repertoire of putative Darwinian behaviors become, for Wynne-Edwards, devices evolved by groups of organisms to limit their popu­lation size. Dominance hierarchies and pecking orders become group-selected controls, exercised by denying reproductive rights to large numbers of poten­tial breeders. The chorusing of frogs, insects and birds become censusing de­vices, whereby populations may judge their numbers and trigger appropriate behaviors of regulation.

Such homeostatic adaptations exist in astonishing profusion and diver­sity, above all in the two great phyla of arthropods and vertebrates. There we shall find machinery for regulating the reproductive output or recruitment rate of the population in a dozen different ways — by varying the quota of breeders, the number of eggs, the resorption of embryos, survival of the newborn and so on; for accelerating or retarding growth-rate and maturity; for limiting the density of colonization or settlement of the habitat; for ejecting surplus members of the population, and even for encompassing their deaths in some cases in order to retrieve the cor­rect balance between population-density and resources (1962, p. 9).



Such massive suppression of the Darwinian game could only be achieved by group selection — that is, by the differential success of groups with emer­gent social behaviors that debar reproduction for many members, thus limit­ing population size from within, and winning temporal persistence by avoid­ing collapse through overexploitation: “We have met already with a number of situations — and shall later meet many more — in which the interests of the individual are actually submerged or subordinated to those of the community as a whole” (1962, p. 18).

Wynne-Edwards surely understood the stringent requirements for such a mechanism. He recognized, for example, that demes or social groups must be persistent and genealogically exclusive in order to act as higher-level “individ­uals” in a selective process — as in this epitome of his views on group selection (1962, p. 144).

To understand group-selection we ought first to recognize that normally local populations are largely of common descent, self-perpetuating and potentially immortal. They are the smallest subdivisions of the species of which this is true, and can be adapted to safeguard their own future. What is actually passed from parent to offspring is the mechanism for re­sponding correctly in the interests of the group in a wide range of cir­cumstances. What is at stake is whether the group itself can survive or will become extinct. If its social adaptations prove inadequate, the stock will decline or disappear and its ground be colonized by neighboring stocks with more successful systems: it must be by this process that group-characters slowly evolve.



The abstract logic of this argument cannot be faulted, but we must ask if the required conditions are encountered frequently enough in nature. Do so­cial groups remain sufficiently exclusive; is group selection strong enough to overcome Darwinian organismic selection; do social behaviors originate by organismal or group selection? Nearly all evolutionists would now agree that groups rarely maintain the required cohesion, and that group selection (in Wynne-Edwards's mode) will usually be far too weak a force to prevail over the conventional Darwinian mechanism of organismic selection.

George Williams's brilliant book, Adaptation and Natural Selection (1966), provided the historical focus for general rejection of Wynne-Edwards's theory. Williams wrote with other sources and targets in mind as well. (He told me, for example, that he had originally been most strongly mo­tivated by the false arguments of Allee, Emerson and the Chicago school.) But Wynne-Edwards stood out as the main group-selectionist game in town when Williams wrote his book.

Williams's book won deserved influence by its incisiveness of logic and argument, and for its persuasive style of composition. (I know no better exam­ple of a work that prevailed primarily by the entirely honorable sense of the unfairly maligned word “rhetoric,” properly defined as “the effective use of language.”) Williams begins by characterizing adaptation as an “onerous” concept that should be invoked only when all simpler explanation fails. We should then become all the more impressed when we find that we need to in­voke adaptation so often! Having established one “tough” criterion by per­mitting the invocation of adaptation only when all else fails, Williams then proposes another — this time governing the advocacy of levels higher than the conventional Darwinian focus upon organisms. In short, Williams states, don't make a claim about higher levels unless both logic and empirics permit no other alternative. Adaptation is onerous enough in any case; if we must call upon such a mechanism, we should do so at the lowest possible level of the genealogical hierarchy. This appeal to some form of parsimony or reduc­tion leads Williams to reject all claims for group selection, so long as Darwin­ian organismic selection can render the same phenomenon in principle. Wil­liams presents his argument largely as a theoretical proposition, and only rarely as an empirical claim. If the phenomenology of a situation can be rendered by an organismic interpretation, he asserts, one should then advocate this lower level of causality — even if a group selectionist scenario violates no tenet of logic or plausibility.

In his introductory pages, Williams tells us that claims for group selection have inspired his attempt at cleansing and simplification:

Even among those who have expressed the opinion that selection is the sole creative force in evolution, there are some inconsistent uses of the concept. With some minor qualifications to be discussed later, it can be said that there is no escape from the conclusion that natural selection... can only produce adaptations for the genetic survival of individuals. Many biologists have recognized adaptations of a higher than individual level of organization. A few workers . . . postulate that selection at the level of alternative populations must also be an important source of ad­aptation, and that such selection must be recognized to account for ad­aptations that work for the benefit of groups instead of individuals. I will argue . . . that the recognition of mechanisms for group benefit is based on misinterpretation, and that the higher levels of selection are impotent and not an appreciable factor in the production and maintenance of ad­aptation (1966, pp. 7-8).



This statement includes several interesting features, suggesting useful definitions and frameworks that I will follow throughout this book (while of­ten disagreeing with Williams's own conclusions): (1) The term natural selec­tion shall refer only to Darwin's process at the organismic level; selection at higher levels requires a different name. (2) The logic of group (and higher level) selection cannot be denied; we may only reject the process as impotent relative to natural selection, not as inconceivable. (3) The criterion advanced by group selectionists — the existence of properties that work for the benefit of groups, but at the expense of individual organisms — may be sound in the­ory but inapplicable in fact, for virtually all proposed cases either have been misinterpreted or remain subject to recasting in terms of advantages for or­ganisms alone.

Williams then states his “doctrine,” frankly so designated: “The ground rule — or perhaps doctrine would be a better term — is that adaptation is a spe­cial and onerous concept that should be used only where it is really necessary. When it must be recognized, it should be attributed to no higher a level of or­ganization than is demanded by the evidence. In explaining adaptation, one should assume the adequacy of the simplest form of natural selection, that of alternative alleles in Mendelian populations, unless the evidence clearly shows that this theory does not suffice” (1966, pp. 4-5).

Williams's doctrine then serves as a hammer against group selection. This higher-level process poses no problem in theory, for “there can be no sane doubt about the reality of the process. Rational criticism must center on the importance of the process and on its adequacy in explaining the phenomena attributed to it” (1966, p. 109). But group adaptation is both methodologi­cally onerous (more so than Darwinian adaptation, which is onerous enough already), and theoretically impotent (though potentially operative).

If there are many adaptations of obvious group benefit, which cannot be explained on the basis of genic selection, it must be conceded that group selection has been operative and important. If there are no such adap­tations, we must conclude that group selection has not been impor­tant, and that only genic selection — natural selection in its most austere form — need be recognized as the creative force in evolution. We must al­ways bear in mind that group selection and biotic adaptation are more onerous principles than genic selection and organic adaptation. They should only be invoked when the simpler explanation is clearly inade­quate (1966, pp. 123-124).



(Note that Williams here introduces the ultimate causal reduction to genes as units of selection. He speaks of adaptation at the organismic level — but only as the consequence of genic selection. Thus Williams's book also becomes the manifesto for the ultimate — and, I think, erroneous — Darwinian reductionism still popular today as “selfish gene” thinking in such fields as socio-biology and evolutionary psychology. See Chapter 8 for a critique.)

In closing, Williams waxes messianic in his pointed comparison of natural selection with the teachings of Jesus (see John 8:12 and 14:6): “Perhaps to­day's theory of natural selection, which is essentially that provided more than 30 years ago by Fisher, Haldane, and Wright, is somewhat like Dalton's atomic theory. It may not, in any absolute or permanent sense, represent the truth, but I am convinced that it is the light and the way” (1966, p. 273).

I love Williams's book; his austere and incisive argument shaped my think­ing and that of all evolutionists in my generation. But Williams's central thesis includes a disabling problem in logic, one that produced unfortunate effects in evolutionary practice. Parsimony, or Occam's razor, embodies an impor­tant logical principle when properly applied. William of Occam, a 14th cen­tury English philosopher and divine (a Franciscan), strongly espoused nomi­nalism against the Platonic concept of ideal types as entities in a realm higher than material existence. (For nominalists, our designations of general catego­ries only have standing as names [nomina] based on abstraction from objects in the material world, not as ideal and “excess” archetypes in a non-material realm.) Occam devised his famous motto, “non sunt multiplicanda entia praeter necessitatem” (entities are not to be multiplied beyond necessity), as a weapon in this philosophical battle — an argument against the existence of an ideal Platonic realm (for nominalists regard names of categories only as men­tal abstractions from material objects, and not as descriptions of higher reali­ties, requiring an additional set of unobserved ideal entities, or essences).

Occam's razor, in its legitimate application, therefore operates as a logical principle about the complexity of argument, not as an empirical claim that nature must be maximally simple. Williams's key invocation of parsimony — to reject group selection when an explanation based on organismic selection can be devised for the same results — fails as a general argument, and does not use Occam's razor in a valid manner, on two grounds:

1. Whereas Occam's razor holds that we should not impose complexities upon nature from non-empirical sources of human argument, the factual phe­nomena of nature need not be maximally simple — and the Razor does not ad­dress this completely different issue at all. The Lamarckian one-step route to adaptation, for example, operates more simply and directly than the Darwin­ian two-step process of variation and selection. But nature happens to follow Darwin's path. Similarly, the simultaneous operation of several hierarchical levels in selection may represent a more complex system than the idea that selection works only on organisms. But nature may (and does) work in this hierachical manner.

2. We should recognize Williams's claim as a statement about reductionism, not (as he thought) as an invocation of parsimony. Organismic selec­tion is not intrinsically “simpler” than group or species selection. (One could only call organismic selection “simpler” in the obviously invalid psychologi­cal sense of affirming our habits and legacies as Darwin's intellectual chil­dren.) Consider Williams's argument: “Various levels of adaptive organiza­tion, from the subcellular to the biospheric, might conceivably be recognized, but the principle of parsimony demands that we recognize adaptation at the level necessitated by the facts and no higher. It is my position that adaptation need almost never be recognized at any level above that of a pair of parents and associated offspring” (1966, p. 19).

Lower levels in a hierarchy cannot be deemed inherently simpler, either to conceive or to operationalize, than higher levels. If we had been brought up in an intellectual world that emphasized populations, rather than organisms, as primary entities, we would probably regard interdemic selection as maxi­mally simple, and organismic selection as an unwelcome complication. A pri­ori preference for lower levels represents a claim for reductionism, not parsi­mony. I do not say that such a preference therefore becomes invalid; I simply ask evolutionists to recognize the proper status of Williams's claim as an ar­gument about reductionism — and also to acknowledge that reductionism, as a cultural prejudice, may be far harder to defend than true parsimony, when properly invoked as a logical principle (though aspects of our preferences for parsimony may rank as cultural prejudice as well).*

In Western science, which developed with such strong traditions for explanation by analytic division into constituent parts, claims for reduction have often been mistakenly advanced in the name of parsimony — most notably in biophilosopher C. Lloyd Morgan's early 20th century dictum that no human activity should be explained by a higher psychological faculty when a lower faculty suffices.

This inappropriate invocation of parsimony did not disable Williams's argument because he usually proceeded beyond this theoretical point. That is, Williams extended his argument further by presenting direct evidence favor­ing the organismic mode in particular cases. He wrote: “This conclusion sel­dom has to rest on appeals to parsimony alone, but is usually supported by specific evidence” (1966, p. 19). But subsequent developments force us to consider one of the most troubling phenomena in the sociology of science — the principle of epigones and bandwagons.

Williams himself did not abuse, rigidify, misconstrue, or unduly simplify his criteria — but his followers did, both early and often (to cite the classical principle for voting in Boston local elections), as Williams's “doctrine” be­came a dogma among his epigones. Few aspects of academic life can be more distressing and ironic than the common observation that a fine scholar often becomes a victim of his own success in this manner — but subtle po­sitions can be trivialized to sound bites in science as well as in political culture.

“Genie or organismic selection only” became the bandwagon slogan of the late 60's and 70's. Combined with a strong preference, already established as the Synthesis developed, for hardline adaptationism in general (see previous section), this restriction set a predisposition strong and exclusive enough to be labeled as a dogma: interpret all substantial phenotypic characters as ad­aptations built by natural selection in the organismic mode (or lower). This dictum did not always function as a cleansing wind in a former stable, but all too often as a narrow and misdirected tunnel that carried a necessary reform too far. Moreover, many epigones used the dogma as a kind of linguistic game rather than a guide to research: “Can I tell a clever story to render this or that puzzling phenomenon as an organismic, rather than a group, adaptation?” For some evolutionists, the ability to spin such a tale, and to answer such a challenge as a theoretical affirmation, became the goal of a supposedly scien­tific effort. I have never witnessed a more distressing bandwagon in science, or seen any idea of such salutary origin pushed so far in the direction of thoughtless orthodoxy.

(Pardon a personal incident, but I remember raising a question, early in my career, at a session of the first ICSEB meeting in 1973.1 asked a speaker, fol­lowing his formal presentation, if the dwarfed size of Pleistocene mammals on Mediterranean islands might have been favored by resistance to extinction afforded by the correlated effect of larger population sizes (than full-bodied hippos and elephants could have maintained in such small places). I hadn't thought the issue through, and I may well have been making a dumb sugges­tion, but the speaker's response floored me (and stunned me into silence at this ontogenetic stage of early diffidence). He said this and only this — and his words, with their intended dripping irony, still cut through me — “are you re­ally satisfied with a group selectionist argument like that?” He made no at­tempt to rebut my suggestion with any content whatever; the stigma of group selection sufficed for refutation.)

As a final illustration of how reform, once established, can turn into the opposite phenomenon of rigidification, I interviewed Sewall Wright several times during the last decade of his life. He felt hurt by what he interpreted as his exclusion from the Modern Synthesis (beyond the ritualistic invocation of his name within the founding trinity of population genetics). “I was out of it,” he told me. He explained this passage into obscurity as the failure of a new generation of evolutionists to understand either his intended role for genetic drift, or his proposed mode for the operation of drift within his “shift­ing balance” theory of evolution.

Most evolutionists of the 1960's viewed genetic drift only as a random force of evolutionary change — a prime anomaly under adaptationist harden­ing (or at least a factor relegated to the marginal role of efficacy only in tiny populations at the brink of extinction). Since genetic drift bore such a promi­nent association with Wright's name (extending to its original designation as the “Sewall Wright effect” in early days of the Synthesis), such demotion to marginality relegated the author to a similar fate under hardline adaptationism.

This situation is surely unfair enough in itself, but — and now the irony — Wright had also participated in the adaptationist hardening of the Synthesis (see pp. 522–524), and his later interpretation of genetic drift invoked this concept primarily as an aid to an enlarged style of adaptationism, and not as a contrary force in evolutionary change (as he had originally argued). So if Wright had tried to be helpful in the service of orthodoxy, why did he become so misunderstood and relegated to the sidelines?

Many reasons might explain Wright's fall into limbo, including the opaque character of his highly mathematical writing and the fact that he had invoked genetic drift as a nonadaptive force for change in his earlier work (see p. 523). But the major factor almost surely resides in a failure of evolutionists to un­derstand the multi-leveled character of his theory — the aspect that allows drift to serve as an input to an adaptive process. Wright told me (in an inter­view in 1981) that he originally intended to call his shifting-balance process the “two-level theory,” for the full process relies on essential components of both organismic and interdemic sorting. (Wright also told me that he re­garded “exclusive focus on individual selection” as the major error of the Synthesis.)

In Wright's later formulation of “shifting balance,” drift enters into a cre­ative and selective process in the following manner: The founding population of a new species moves by selection to an adjacent adaptive peak in a larger landscape. The chief problem for adaptationism then intrudes: this initial peak will probably not represent the most favored spot in the landscape (for other unoccupied peaks probably stand higher), but how can daughter demes ever move to these better places? Valleys of lesser fitness surround this local peak. If evolution always proceeds towards adaptation, then the initial popu­lation must remain stuck on the first peak forever. But drift allows small groups to enter valleys, and to cross troughs into areas where selection may then draw populations up to a higher peak. When expanding populations, by this process, occupy several peaks in the landscape, a process of interdemic (interpeak) sorting can occur, eventually leading to a mean increase in adap­tation for the species as a whole. Thus, genetic drift does not operate as a ran­dom force against adaptation in Wright's mature theory, but as a source of variability for fueling a higher-level process of interdemic sorting. In other words, drift operates as part of a process that enhances adaptation through higher-level sorting.

This argument seems clear enough in logic (its validity, or relative fre­quency, in the world of real populations raises a different issue that can only be resolved empirically). Why was Wright's theory misunderstood or, even worse, simply ignored? I suggest the following (and unfortunate) primary reason: How could Wright's argument be grasped by an intellectual commu­nity now committed to the exclusivity of organismic selection? The concep­tual tools no longer exist under such a stricture: adaptation arises by “strug­gle” for reproductive success among genes or organisms; drift causes a population to depart from a place attained by such struggle. How then could drift possibly act as a helpmate to adaptation? To grasp Wright's view, one must allow for a higher level of interdemic sorting, and one must understand the logic of hierarchical models, with sorting operating at several nested levels.

The intellectual space for viewing drift as an aid to interdemic selection doesn't exist in a context of exclusive commitment to selection at genic or organismic levels. Wright's idea then gets demoted to a status even lower than “merely wrong” in such a world; “shifting balance,” in Wright's own sense, becomes inconceivable, and therefore intellectually inaccessible. Erro­neous ideas can at least be expressed and made available to others with po­tentially different opinions. But the definitions of orthodoxy simply erased Wright's multiple-level theory — in much the same way that evolutionary sta­sis could not be recognized as interesting, or even grasped as a phenomenon at all, within a community committed to gradualism. When we think an idea through, and then reject the notion, we have at least made an intellectual decision (perhaps wrong, perhaps overly rigid). But when we maintain an unarticulated and unexamined commitment, and then use such a premise, al­beit unconsciously, to render interesting ideas inconceivable, then we have fallen under the spell of dogma.

Sewall Wright — unlike Schubert, Wegener and a host of historical figures deemed tragic — lived long enough to witness his vindication (and to partici­pate mightily in his renewed respect by writing a four-volume mathemati­cal treatise, largely during his eighties — see Wright, 1978). But his period of unjustified eclipse should warn us all about the dangers of bandwagons and unexamined commitments.





EXTRAPOLATION INTO GEOLOGICAL TIME





A good flavor of the confidence, even the dogmatism, of the hardened synthe­sis, as presented at the Darwinian centennial celebrations of 1959 (see pp. 569–576), shines forth in Mayr's introductory proclamation from his 1963 book. Mayr pronounces the “complete unanimity” of competent professional opinion, the “colossal ignorance” of the “few dissenters,” and the conse­quent “waste of time” involved in any refutation of the intellectual stragglers:

When we reread the volumes published in 1909, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Origin of Species, we realize how little agreement there was at that time among the evolutionists. The change since then has been startling. Symposia and conferences were held all over the world in 1959 in honor of the Darwin centennial, and were attended by all the leading students of evolution. If we read the volumes result­ing from these meetings ... we are almost startled at the complete una­nimity in the interpretation of evolution presented by the participants. Nothing could show more clearly how internally consistent and firmly established the synthetic theory is. The few dissenters, the few who still operate with Lamarckian and finalistic concepts display such colossal ig­norance of the principles of genetics and of the entire modern literature that it would be a waste of time to refute them. The essentials of the modern theory are to such an extent consistent with the facts of genetics, systematics, and paleontology that one can hardly question their correct­ness (1963, p. 8).



Later on, Mayr proposes a succinct definition of the Synthesis, emphasiz­ing all three legs (or branches) of the essential tripod (or tree) of Darwinian logic “The proponents of the synthetic theory maintain that all evolution is due to the accumulation of small genetic changes, guided by natural selec­tion, and that transpecific evolution is nothing but an extrapolation and magnification of the events that take place within populations and species” (1963, p. 586).

I regard Mayr's balance of emphases as particularly revealing. His defini­tion includes two phrases. The first statement buttresses the two legs of Dar­win's tripod that receive most attention in this work — control of direction by external selection rather than internal constraint (with attendant gradualism of change), and operation of the process through differential reproductive success of organisms (implicit in the term “natural,” as opposed to some other form or level of selection). But the second, and longer, statement affirms Mayr's appreciation for the importance of the third leg — the complete suf­ficiency of microevolutionary theory to explain the entire history of life — so long as the earth's geological behavior sets a proper stage, and does not derail a full extrapolation of microevolutionary mechanics into all geological time and to the entire extent of phylogenetic change. For how can we celebrate the power and generality of a beautiful, sufficient and completely validated mechanism of change, established for the immediacy of an ecological here and now, if the same processes cannot render the broad pattern of life's his­tory as well?

This theme of extrapolation becomes, in many ways, the most comprehen­sive issue of all. In Chapter 2, I distinguished two separate aspects of Dar­win's radicalism in proposing the theory of natural selection — a methodologi­cal pole to grant operational status to the study of evolution by asserting that observable events, however apparently trivial and inconsequential, can ex­plain change at all scales by extension; and an ideological pole to present a radical mechanism of evolutionary change for rendering all “higher” attri­butes of good design and organic harmony as side-consequences of a process working only by a struggle among organisms for personal reproductive suc­cess. Strict Darwinians must defend extrapolation as crucial at both poles — for observable events at small scale cannot generate the full panoply of phylogeny without such a principle; while daily happenings cannot accumulate into totalities if the background setting does not “behave” properly — if, for example, the ecological stage explodes every once in a geological while, fortu­itously dumping most of the improved and accumulated inhabitants into a vat of extinction.

For these two reasons — to validate the entire methodological pole and to uphold the third leg of the Darwinian tripod supporting the ideological pole — the principle of extrapolation represents the key to the validity of the Synthesis as a fully general theory of evolution. And extrapolation — the es­sential Lyellian postulate that Darwin imbibed from his most important men­tor (see p. 94) — embodies two central aspects of what Lyell and his school called “uniformitarianism”: (i) the complete theoretical sufficiency of cur­rently acting small-scale changes to produce, by successive and imperceptible increments, the entire panoply of large-scale phenomena; and (ii) the proper “behavior” of the earth, with geological change sufficiently slow and steady that trends produced by gradualistic, accumulative natural selection will not be derailed often enough to yield a history of life patterned more by these geological upsets than by biological accumulations.

For this last leg of the tripod, the Synthesis did not so much harden as be­come emboldened during its ontogeny. We have seen (pp. 514–518) how Haldane and Huxley, in the early days of the Synthesis, still respected (even feared) apparent paleontological exceptions to natural selection as the cause of trends. But the balance of power had shifted by the 1960's. Simpson (1944, 1953) and others had forged their “consistency argument” — the principle that all known phenomena of the fossil record can, in principle, be explained by modern mechanisms of genetics and selection (even though no direct proof of sufficiency can be derived from paleontological evidence). Paleontology had been tamed, taken in by the synthesis, and told to behave. (And I do in­tend “taken in” in the metaphorical sense as well, as I shall argue more ex­plicitly in Chapter 9.) Paleontology could retain the archives of actual phe­nomenology as its particular bailiwick in exchange for giving up the conceit of believing that the fossil record could say anything distinctive about the causes of evolutionary change.

The distinguished panel on “the evolution of life” at the Chicago cen­tennial celebration of 1959 included Julian Huxley as chairman, Th. Dobzhansky, E. B. Ford, Ernst Mayr, Ledyard Stebbins, and Sewall Wright. After an orthodox discussion of mechanisms, Huxley shifted the topic to “the course, the process, of evolution as shown in the fossils” (Tax and Callender, 1960, volume 3, p. 127) — and paleobotanist D. I. Axelrod rose to present a summary in advance, characterizing the history of life as a stately process of unfolding to more and better: “I think most of us are in full agreement about the gradual change in time: increasing diversification; then, gradual transformation, so new categories gradually arise, first at smaller and then at higher levels” (in Tax and Callender, 1960, volume 3, p. 127).

In the panel's stated agenda of 16 points, only one even hints at non-adaptive phenomena, and only as an adjunct to selectionist orthodoxy. Huxley addressed this topic midway through the discussion: “Natural selec­tion may lead to side effects, which at the same time are of no adaptive value but may later provide the basis for adaptive changes” (Tax and Callender, 1960, volume 3, p. 125). Vertebrate paleontologist E. C. Olson, the sympo­sium's lone (and very gentle) doubter (see pp. 574–576), ventured a percep­tive comment on this point. But his words, as Moses said of Pharaoh's chari­ots, promptly “sank as lead in the mighty waters.” The entire discussion of this topic occupies less than a page. Olson said: “This is the general area in which we can include events that are random with respect to the adaptive value of the genotype of populations. I refer to the simple matter of acci­dent — for example, the effects of a forest fire on a population ... This sort of side effect, the impact of accidents and other factors producing non-adaptive shifts, may cause very rapid changes and give completely new shape to the course of evolution. I think this is an extremely important evolutionary fac­tor” (in Tax and Callender, 1960, volume 3, p. 125).

If the Synthesis viewed the entire history of life, the full tree itself, as grow­ing by an adaptive and stately unfolding, then the history of single branches — trends in lineages, the primary topic of macroevolutionary study — also re­ceived a thoroughly adaptationist reading in the extrapolationist mode. At the same Chicago conference, Simpson defended the adaptationist postulate for all geometries, parallel as well as diverging lineages, and even (in principle and without direct evidence) for “erratic” features where selective control “is not apparent.”

The selectionist theory is that a trend is adaptive for the lineage involved, that it continues only as long as it is adaptive, that it stops when adapta­tion is as complete as selection can make it in given circumstances, and that it changes or the group becomes extinct if a different direction of evolution becomes adaptive. Often the adaptive nature of a trend seems apparent. Often it is not apparent, but the postulate seems required to account for otherwise erratic features of trends. In instances of parallel evolution the selectionist theory is that changes actually occurring in parallel are adaptive over the whole ecological range occupied by the group, while those divergent (radiating) within the group are adapta­tions to special niches within that range (Simpson, 1960, pp. 170-171).



Under these precepts, a procedure of building scenarios in the strictly adaptationist mode, based on assumption and conjecture, often passed for ade­quate explanation. The second half of the Chicago panel on the “evolution of life,” supposedly dedicated to the actual record of evolutionary change, in­cluded almost no discussion about paleontology, and relied on theoretical inferences about the past based on knowledge of modern organisms. Ernst Mayr, however, did offer the following conjecture — wrong in many details (as we now know), yet firm in its confident adaptationist scenario — for the evo­lution of lungs. (Devonian fishes already possessed lungs, for the trait is symplesiomorphic in tetrapods and their aquatic ancestors, with the swim bladder of later fishes as its derived homolog. But note Mayr's confidence in his erroneous conjecture for the easy construction of such a novelty — from scratch, gradually, and in pure adaptive continuity with unchanging func­tion):

I think the development of lungs is now pretty well understood. Certain fishes during the Devonian period lived in stagnant, fresh water swamps, where oxygen was so scant that respiration through the skin and the gills no longer provided the necessary oxygen. Apparently they came to the surface and gulped air, from which the membranes of the digestive tract took up oxygen. When that stage was reached, there was a tremendous selection pressure for developing diverticles and enlarging this respira­tory surface of the digestive tract. As soon as the necessary gene combi­nation providing such diverticles appeared, selection pressure could push this tendency further and further, and this led quite naturally to the de­velopment of lungs (in Tax, 1960, volume 3, p. 136).



As documented in Chapter 6, the putative domination of biotic over abiotic competition provided Darwin with a rationale for defending general progress in the history of life. The synthesists upheld this orthodoxy as well, thereby imparting broad predictability to the stately unfolding of life. Huxley offered a clear assessment of relative frequencies in the founding document (1942, p. 495): “Sometimes the inorganic environment changes markedly, as when there is a climatic revolution, such as occurred at the end of the Creta­ceous; but in general it is the organic environment which shows the more rapid and important alterations.”

In his concluding address to the entire Chicago symposium, Huxley then remarked, with the expanded scope and surer resolve of nearly two decades in hardening: “Improved organization gives biological advantage. Accord­ingly, the new type becomes a successful or dominant group. It spreads and multiplies and differentiates into a multiplicity of branches. This new biologi­cal success is usually achieved at the biological expense of the older dominant group from which it sprang or whose place it had usurped. Thus, the rise of the placental mammals was correlated with the decline of the terrestrial rep­tiles, and the birds replaced the pterosaurs as dominant in the air” (1960, p. 250).

In citing the canonical example of dinosaurs and mammals, Huxley ex­poses the heart of the extrapolationist error — the assumption that large-scale pattern can be inferred by extending, through immense time, the small effects of observable processes (in this case the supposed general and overall “superi­ority” of mammals over reptiles in most cases of immediate competition). In explaining trends, the greatest threat to this orthodoxy lies in occasional but profound environmental catastrophe that disrupts and resets the pattern accumulating during “normal” times. The theory and factuality of catastrophic mass extinction has now broken this orthodoxy (see Chapter 12), but sim­ple knowledge of mass extinction had always posed a threat, especially in Cuvier's original paroxysmal interpretation (see pp. 484–492). The synthesists therefore treated this apparent phenomenon in the conventional and congenial way, either by dismissing a catastrophic cause, or by “spreading out” the time of extinction so that all deaths could be encompassed by tradi­tional competitive mechanisms, perhaps enhanced in intensity by rapid envi­ronmental changes, and therefore propelling adaptive evolution even more rigorously. Huxley (1942, p. 446), for example, held that tough physical con­ditions only accelerated the competitive takeover by superior groups: “The worsening of the climate at the end of the Mesozoic reduced the general adaptiveness of the dinosaurs, pterosaurs, and other reptilian groups, while increasing that of the early mammals and birds.”

Ernst Mayr, in his characteristically forthright way, then linked the denial of catastrophic extinction, via uniformitarianism, to the crucial second state­ment in his definition of the Synthesis (see p. 557), the requirement for ex­trapolation into geological vastness: “Yet it has become clear that there is nothing in the past history of the earth that cannot be interpreted in terms of the processes that are known to occur in the Recent fauna. There is no need to invoke unknown vital forces, mutational avalanches, or cosmic catastro­phes. Geographic speciation, adaptation to the available niches (guided by se­lection), and competition are largely responsible for the observed phenomena” (1963, p. 617).

In short, by viewing trends as adaptive and anagenetic phenomena, pro­pelled by competition and building, by a lengthy process of stepwise summa­tion, the principal pattern of life's history, the Synthesis encompassed the most salient phenomenon of paleontology within its favored framework of extrapolation. All causality could reside in the accessible here and now. How then, we must ask, did the Synthesis treat the two phenomena — speciation and extinction — now viewed as crucial in breaking the extrapolationist or­thodoxy (for if trends must be expressed as the differential success of some kinds of species vs. others, with most species formed in geological moments, then the adaptive struggles of populations don't extrapolate smoothly to changes of mean and modal phenotypes within clades)?

The developing orthodoxy generally acknowledged speciation and then demoted its importance and distinctiveness. According to Huxley, for example, all radiations should be treated as adaptive and each event of speciation therefore represents an independent, gradualistic expression of an anagenetic trend (1942, p. 487): “The adaptive radiation is seen to be the result of a number of gradual evolutionary trends, each tending to greater specializa­tion — in other words to greater adaptive efficiency in various mechanisms subservient to some particular mode of life... Each single adaptive trend also shows the phenomenon of successional speciation.”

In a statement that I find charming, however wrongheaded, Nicholson (1960, p. 518, at the Chicago centennial symposium) extolled speciation as a device to provide more opportunities for adaptation to work its “untrammeled” magic: “The splitting of organisms into the genetically isolated groups we call 'species' has played a very important part in evolution, for it has permitted selection to proceed untrammeled within each group, so per­mitting adaptations of innumerable kinds in the different groups. Had organ­isms not divided into genetically isolated groups, the numerous and beautiful adaptations so characteristic of living things could not have evolved, nor could organisms have used the resources of the world in the efficient way they do” (Nicholson, 1960, p. 518).

More commonly, however, speciation received short shrift rather than glory. Evolution required such a process of multiplication, of course, lest fa­vorable trends disappear through the extinction of single species bearing their fruits. Speciation therefore became a hedge against death by parcelling out, into several iterated lines, a set of adaptations built anagenetically — so that the extinction of one species could not abort the general benefit. The trend itself remains anagenetic (see Fig. 7-2), for speciation does not contribute to the directionality of evolutionary change. (Under later views, including punctuated equilibrium, differential speciation constructs the trend, and anagenetic main trunks do not even exist.)

Simpson held strongly to this view, and even ventured a quantitative de­fense, in his repeated assertions that speciation represents only a minor mode in evolution because 90 percent of important changes arise anagenetically in the phyletic mode (1944, 1953; Simpson recognized three major modes of change: speciation, phyletic evolution, and quantum evolution). Huxley, in a grand prose flourish, then branded speciation as a pretty little epiphenomenon, a luxurious patina upon the grand pattern of evolution — never realizing





7-2. Standard view of the role of speciation in evolutionary trends under the Modern Synthesis. Speciation certainly plays an important part in iterating favorable variations produced by anagenesis within species. (If this iteration did not occur, lineages would quickly become extinct because individual species must eventually die.) But the trend in morphology arises almost entirely by anagenetic directionalism within the geological duration of individual species.





that the pattern itself might be built by higher-level sorting, operating through the differential success of certain kinds of species!

The formation of many geographically isolated and most genetically isolated species is thus without any bearing upon the main processes of evo­lution ... Much of the minor systematic diversity to be observed in nature is irrelevant to the main course of evolution, a mere thrill of variety superimposed upon its broad pattern. We may thus say that, while it is inevitable that life should be divided up into species, and that the broad processes of evolution should operate with species as units of organiza­tion, the number thus necessitated is far less than the number, which ac­tually exist. Species-formation constitutes one aspect of evolution; but a large fraction of it is in a sense an accident, a biological luxury, without bearing upon the major and continuing trends of the evolutionary pro­cess (Huxley, 1942, p. 389).



Amidst this attempt to relegate the origin of the primary unit of macroevolution to irrelevancy at larger scales, one prominent voice within the Syn­thesis spoke up for the centrality of speciation in constructing large-scale pat­tern. In a cautious, but prophetic statement, Ernst Mayr (1963, p. 587) wrote: “To state the problems of macroevolution in terms of species and pop­ulations as 'units of evolution' reveals previously neglected problems and sometimes leads to an emphasis on different aspects.” (Much of macroevolutionary theory, as developed later, begins with this proposition, and Mayr therefore becomes an inspiration — ironically in a sense, for several key con­cepts in this developing body of thought have challenged other aspects of the Synthesis that Mayr so strongly championed. For example, the theory of punctuated equilibrium rests upon a proper translation into geological time of Mayr's peripatric theory of speciation — see Eldredge and Gould, 1972, and Chapter 9.

Directly refuting Huxley's charge that speciation only ranks as a frill and luxury in the overall pattern of evolutionary change, Mayr wrote:

I feel that it is the very process of creating so many species, which leads to evolutionary progress. Species, in the sense of evolution, are quite comparable to mutations. They also are a necessity for evolutionary progress, even though only one out of many mutations leads to a significant improvement of the genotype. Since each coadapted gene complex has different properties and since these properties are, so to speak, not predictable, it requires the creation of a large number of such gene complexes before one is achieved that will lead to real evolutionary advance. Seen in this light, it appears then that a prodigious multiplication of spe­cies is a prerequisite for evolutionary progress... Without speciation, there would be no diversification of the organic world, no adaptive radiation, and very little evolutionary progress. The species, then, is the key­stone of evolution (1963, p. 621).



A world of difference separates the negative view held by most synthesists — that speciation merely iterates (and therefore buffers) adaptations pro­duced by a different, anagenetic process — from Mayr's recognition that adap­tations may be pieced together through accumulated events of speciation, each chancy in itself and not directed towards the eventual novel phenotype. In this sense, Mayr's view becomes the root for those branches of modern macroevolutionary theory that treat speciation as a higher-order analog of organismic birth — leading to a concept of trends as the product of differential sorting within the multitude of units thereby produced, and not as the extrap­olated result of organismic selection within anagenetic lineages.

If most of the synthesists viewed speciation as trivial, they didn't grant even this modicum of concern to the counterpart process of extinction. Although they acknowledged the death of species (for a process affecting 99 percent of all species that ever lived can't be entirely ignored), they viewed extinction en­tirely in a negative light — as a loss of adaptation, and therefore as a failure in evolution, something to be recognized but not extensively discussed in polite company. Even Ernst Mayr, who understood so clearly how speciation could enter a higher-level process of sorting, didn't grasp the logical corollary — that any selective process must pair survivals with eliminations, and that “de­feats” can therefore teach us as much as “victories.” Instead, Mayr professed puzzlement as to why such a profoundly negative phenomenon should be so common:

We find so many cases of extreme sensitivity of natural selection, doing the most incredible and impossible things; and yet the whole pathway of evolution is strewn left and right with the bodies of extinct types. The frequency of extinction is a great puzzle to me (in Tax, 1960, volume 3, p. 141).

Natural selection comes up with the right answer so often that one is sometimes tempted to forget its failures. Yet the history of the earth is a history of extinction, and every extinction is in part a defeat for natural selection... Natural selection does not always produce the needed improvements (1960, pp. 375-376).



The Synthetic approach to macroevolution can be encapsulated in a few dicta: view life as stately unfolding under adaptive control; depict trends as accumulative and anagenetic within lineages according to the extrapolationist model; downplay or ignore the macroevolutionary calculus of birth and death of species. These propositions leave little role for the actual archives of life's history — the fossil record — beyond the documentation of change. The causes of change must be ascertained elsewhere, and entirely by neontologists (my profession's term for the folks who study modern organisms). Thus the Synthesis held paleontology at arm's length. (I suppose we deserved this deni­gration in retaliation for the plethora of poorly conceived, anti-Darwinian assertions and speculations that so many earlier paleontologists had falsely based upon the fossil record — see Chapter 4. In this sense, our later demo­tion, however unfairly extended, became part of the salutary cleansing accomplished by the early Synthesis in its first phase of restriction — see pp. 505–505.) Huxley (1942, p. 41) spoke of “the illegitimacy of using data on the course of evolution to make assertions as to its mechanism.”* He continued:

As admitted by various paleontologists ... a study of the course of evo­lution cannot be decisive in regard to the method of evolution. All that paleontology can do in this latter field is to assert that, as regards the type of organisms, which it studies, the evolutionary methods suggested by the geneticists, and evolutionists shall not contradict its data. For in­stance, in face of the gradualness of transformation revealed by paleon­tology in sea urchins or horses it is no good suggesting that large muta­tions of the sort envisaged by de Vries shall have played a major part in providing the material for evolutionary change (1942, p. 38).



Even so iconoclastic a morphologist as D. Dwight Davis, who would later tweak strict adaptationism so effectively in discussing formal and historical constraints in his classic monograph on the giant panda (Davis, 1964), wrote for the Princeton meeting on genetics, paleontology, and evolution (1949, p. 77): “Paleontology supplies factual data on the actual rates of change in the skeleton and the patterns of phyletic change in the skeleton. Because of the inherent limitations of paleontological data, however, it cannot perceive the factors producing such changes. Attempts to do so merely represent a superimposition of neobiological concepts on paleontological data.”

I admit, of course, that paleontologists have no access to mechanisms requiring direct observation of ontogeny and ecological interaction. But to say, as Davis does, that we cannot ever derive concepts of evolutionary mecha­nisms from paleontological data — and must therefore gain all our causal un­derstanding from “neobiology” — seems excessively pessimistic, and consigns paleontology to impotence. If paleontologists cannot gain insights about mechanisms, then historical science of any kind becomes impossible, for all scientific study of the past must make causal inferences from results of pro­cesses that cannot be directly observed.

Moreover, if historical data hold such limited promise, then the conse­quences become even more serious for science in general. For if we acknowl­edge that extrapolationism can't suffice in principle because much of macro-evolution proceeds by patterns of differential birth and death among species, and if we cannot generate any theory about such higher-level sorting because we cannot observe the constituent events directly, then much of evolution be­comes unknowable in principle. Fortunately, such pessimism may be firmly rejected (see Gould, 1986, on Darwin's use of historical science, and 1989c, on applications to the history of life at greatest scale). Much of the best sci­ence — inevitably and properly — relies upon inference and insight, not always upon direct sight.

Young scientists can easily succumb to the thrall of such proclamations by leaders. The stupidest passage I ever wrote occurs in the heart of a contribu­tion to independent macroevolutionary theory — our original piece on punc­tuated equilibrium, where I stated (this excerpt comes from my part of a joint text with Niles Eldredge):

First, we must emphasize that mechanisms of speciation can be studied directly only with experimental and field techniques applied to living organisms. No theory of evolutionary mechanisms can be generated directly from paleontological data. Instead, theories developed by students of the modern biota generate predictions about the course of evolution in time... We can apply and test, but we cannot generate new mecha­nisms. If discrepancies are found between paleontological data and the expected patterns, we may be able to identify those aspects of a general theory that need improvement. But we cannot formulate these improve­ments ourselves (Eldredge and Gould, 1972, pp. 93-94).



Stanley (1975) then properly rebuked us for such unwarranted subservi­ence. Our current partnership with “neobiology,” based on the “bonded in­dependence” of macroevolutionary theory — the recognition that we can gen­erate and test novel concepts but cannot come close to a fully adequate account of macroevolution without the vital input of microevolutionary the­ory — produces a better balance of subdisciplines. This mutually sustaining in­teraction must benefit paleontology, but such an enlarged view will also aid anyone, in any evolutionary subdiscipline, who wishes to comprehend the “grandeur in this view of life.”





From Overstressed Doubt to Overextended Certainty





A TALE OF TWO CENTENNIALS





Darwin did all Americans a mnemonic favor by entering the world on the same day as Abraham Lincoln — February 12, 1809. He also made life sim­pler for conference organizers by publishing the Origin of Species in 1859, at age 50 — thus intensifying the force of commemorations and cutting their re­quired number in half. We have indeed celebrated mightily at the requisite times, with the usual array of resulting Festschriften. As others have noted, and as I have stated throughout this chapter, the two celebrations of the 20th century occurred at maximally disparate moments in the history of evolution­ary theory: in 1909 at the heyday of doubt about natural selection as a potent mechanism, and in 1959 at the apotheosis of certainty about the nearly exclu­sive power of selection as an agent of evolutionary change. A comparison of the two centennials therefore provides a striking example and epitome of the success (and rigidification) of the Modern Synthesis.

Consider two of the leading symposia in 1909: the “official” celebration held in Cambridge (Seward, 1909), and the major American vernacular Fest­schrift, published as a special issue of Popular Science Monthly in 1909. The cardinal message reeks with ambiguity (for a celebration of Darwin's accom­plishments): complete confidence in the fact of evolution; lavish praise for Darwin as midwife of the factual confirmation; admission that no consensus has been reached on mechanisms of evolutionary change; and a general feel­ing that natural selection plays, at most, a minor role.

A few strong selectionists restated their claims, most notably the two sur­viving members of Darwin's inner circle: Joseph Hooker and Alfred Russel Wallace. But even Wallace, the most ardent of selectionists, could no longer muster the confidence and enthusiasm of former years. The qualifiers in his “triumphalist” statement could not be more revealing — for he can now only assert that selection has been adopted as a “satisfying” solution by “a large number” of qualified experts: “And this brings me to the very interesting question: Why did so many of the greatest intellects fail, while Darwin and myself hit upon the solution of this problem — a solution which this celebra­tion proves to have been (and still to be) a satisfying one to a large number of those best able to form a judgment on its merits” (Wallace, 1909, p. 398).

The range of opinions expressed at the Cambridge symposium illustrates the turmoil in evolutionary theory at Darwin's 100th birthday. Participants spanned the full spectrum from August Weismann's defense of selection's Allmacht (all-sufficiency) to Bateson's claims for selection's impotence (ac­companied by lavish praise for Darwin's other achievement in establishing the fact of evolution — see p. 396). More commonly, authors tried to assimi­late Darwin to their own disparate views, thereby turning the profession's hero into a chameleon. For de Vries, Darwin became a closet saltationist (see p. 416 on editor Seward's annoyance at de Vries' false and self-serving reinterpretation of Darwin). For Haeckel, Darwin ranked as a pluralist, a true kin to the speaker who had dedicated volume 2 of his Generelle Morphologie col­lectively to Darwin, Lamarck, and Goethe! (Haeckel, 1866). Haeckel wrote (1909, pp. 140-141), trying to distance Darwin from Weismann's position (called “neoDarwinism” at the time), and to reinvent the symposium's hero as a man in the middle between selectionism and Lamarckism: “It seems to me quite improper to describe this [Weismann's] hypothetical structure as 'NeoDarwinism.' Darwin was just as convinced as Lamarck of the transmis­sion of acquired characters and its great importance in the scheme of evolu­tion ... Natural selection does not of itself give the solution of all our evolu­tionary problems. It has to be taken in conjunction with the transformism of Lamarck, with which it is in complete harmony.”

The strategy of Henry Fairfield Osborn (in heaping praise on Darwin while denying any substantial power to natural selection) well illustrates the most consistent theme of both 1909 symposia. “There is no denying,” Osborn writes (1909, p. 332), “that there is today a wide reaction against the central feature of Darwin's thought and this leads us to consider the merit of this re­action.” Osborn then invoked a time-honored diplomatic tactic by defining Darwin's achievement as threefold: establishment of the “law of evolution” itself, documentation of the fact of evolution, and development of the theory of natural selection. Since the first two propositions cannot be gainsaid, why fuss over the third, even if Darwin overemphasized the role of natural selec­tion? Osborn notes (1909, p. 332): “There is some lack of perspective, some egotism, much onesidedness in modern criticism. The very announcement, 'Darwin deposed,' attracts such attention as would the notice 'Mt. Blanc re­moved.'”

Osborn correctly identifies two claims at the core of Darwinian theory: (1) selection operates on undirected variability to cause evolutionary change (legs one and two of my tripod); and (2) gradualism rules in geological time (leg three and the methodological pole): “In the operations of this intimate circle of minute variations within organisms, he was inclined to believe two things: first that the fit or adaptive always arises out of the accidental, or that out of large and minute variations without direction selection brings direc­tion and fitness; second, as a consistent pupil of Lyell, he was inclined to be­lieve that the chief changes in evolution are slow and continuous” (Osborn, 1909).

But Osborn then gently chides Darwin for putting too much faith in the power of selection: “There can be no question, however, that Darwin did love his selection theory, and sometimes overestimated its importance” (1909, p. 336). Then, as a consummate politician and administrator, Osborn put a positive spin on his criticism — granting ultimate praise with only a faint damn. He emphasized the most common of all anti-Darwinian arguments — that selection can only operate as a negative force (“judicial” rather than “creative”). But he then converted Darwin's weakness to centennial strength with a remarkable diplomatic move: Darwin's problems arose from his igno­rance of heredity, but he set a great task for us thereby, and we must per­severe:

Selection is not a creative principle, it is a judicial principle. It is one of Darwin's many triumphs that he positively demonstrated that this judi­cial principle is one of the great factors of evolution. Then he clearly set our task before us in pointing out that the unknown lies in the laws of variation and a stupendous task it is. At the same time he left us a legacy in his inductive and experimental methods by which we may blaze our trail. Therefore, in this anniversary year, we do not see any decline in the force of Darwinism but rather a renewed stimulus to progressive search.



This diplomatic theme — that Darwin did not discover an adequate mecha­nism of evolution, but we celebrate his centennial because he opened up a new world of research — became a virtual litany for symposiasts. For exam­ple, William Morton Wheeler virtually threw selection in the ashcan as he praised Darwin: “And even if we go so far as to say that natural selection may eventually prove to be an unimportant factor in evolution, to be consigned to the limbo of defunct hypotheses, together with Darwin's views on Pangenesis, sexual selection and the origin of species from fluctuating variations, we must, I believe, still admit that the great English naturalist opened up before us a vast new world of thought and endeavor” (Wheeler, 1909, p. 385).

T. H. Morgan, who would later become a strong supporter of natural selection, began his centennial contribution by expressing the standard argument that Darwin's importance transcends the limitations of natural selection: “The loyalty that every man of science feels towards Darwin is something greater than any special theory. I shall call it the spirit of Darwinism, the point of view, the method, the procedure of Darwin” (Morgan, 1909, p. 367). Morgan then ended his article, entitled “For Darwin,” by heaping tangential scorn on natural selection while praising the liberating generality of evolution itself: “We stand today on the foundations laid 50 years ago. Darwin's method is our method; the way he pointed out we follow, not as the advocates of a dogma, not as the disciples of any particular creed, but the avowed adherents of a method of investigation whose inauguration we owe chiefly to Charles Darwin. For it is this spirit of Darwinism, not its formulae, that we proclaim as our best heritage” (1909, p. 380).

William Bateson, the least Darwinian of the symposiasts, began his article on the same theme, and then stated his own view right up front: “Darwin's work has the property of greatness in that it may be admired from more as­pects than one. For some the perception of the principle of Natural Selection stands out as his most wonderful achievement to which all the rest is subordi­nate. Others, among whom I would range myself, look up to him rather as the first who plainly distinguished, collected, and comprehensively studied that new class of evidence from which hereafter a true understanding of the process of Evolution may be developed” (Bateson, 1909, p. 85). Bateson then added (see p. 596 for more on this quotation and Bateson's general views), in a statement that strikes me as the most appropriately generous, genuine and cogent expression of an argument that could be advanced with equal validity today: “We shall honor most in him not the rounded merit of finite accom­plishment, but the creative power by which he inaugurated a line of discovery endless in variety and extension” (1909, p. 85).

Finally, consider the dilemma of A. C. Seward, general editor of the “of­ficial” Cambridge celebration, who followed a British tradition of fairness in inviting all sides, but then struggled to find some coherence amidst the Babel of papers he received: “The divergence of views among biologists in regard to the origin of species and as to the most promising directions in which to seek for truth is illustrated by the different opinions of contributors. Whether Dar­win's views on the modus operandi of evolutionary forces receive further con­firmation in the future, or whether they are materially modified, in no way af­fects the truth of the statement that, by employing his life 'in adding a little to Natural Science,' he revolutionized the world of thought” (Seward, 1909, p. vii).

I can imagine no contrast more stark, no reversal so complete, as the comparison of these doubts in 1909 with the confidence and near unanimity expressed fifty years later at the Origin's centennial in 1959. The success of the Modern Synthesis established the difference. Beginning as a pluralistic mar­riage of Darwin and Mendel in the 1930's, the Synthesis had hardened by 1959 into a set of core commitments that, at least among epigones and aco­lytes, had become formulaic and almost catechistic, if not outright dogmatic.

Again, I will consider two leading Festschriften of this later centennial, the two major American celebrations in this case: the American Philosophical Society's annual general meeting in Philadelphia, and the elaborate festival held in Chicago in 1959 (published as a three volume compendium, edited by Sol Tax, in 1960). Major speakers at both meetings attributed the remarkable uniformity of opinion on all major issues to the success of the Synthesis, par­ticularly to a consensus on the paramount, virtually exclusive, role of natural selection as the cause of evolutionary change. Ledyard Stebbins, appropri­ately for the City of Brotherly Love, spoke in Philadelphia about the unifying power of natural selection: “The last quarter of the century which has elapsed since the publication of The Origin of Species has seen the gradual spread and an almost universal acceptance by biologists actively working with problems of evolution of some form of the neodarwinian concept of evolutionary dy­namics. This concept may be broadly defined as one which, like Darwin's original concept, maintains that the direction and rate of evolution have been largely determined by natural selection” (Stebbins, 1959, p. 231). Mean­while, in Chicago, Julian Huxley gave a capsule history of Darwinism, ascrib­ing the same binding role to natural selection: “The emergence of Darwinism, I would say, covered the fourteen-year period from 1859 to 1872; and it was in full flower until the 1890's, when Bateson initiated the anti-Darwinian re­action. This in turn lasted for about a quarter of a century, to be succeeded by the present phase of Neo-Darwinism, in which the central Darwinian concept of natural selection has been successfully related to the facts and principles of modern genetics, ecology, and paleontology” (Huxley, 1960, p. 10).

Michael Lerner's development of the argument (in the Philadelphia symposium) may be viewed as typical for this confident time. He begins with the venerable (if cryptic) motto of the Greek poet Archilochus: “The fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing.” As a profession, Lerner states, we marched along the path from Darwin to the Modern Synthesis as urchins, following the “one big thing” of natural selection, and ultimately re­jecting the major alternatives as “sins against Occam's razor.” Lerner wrote:

Their one big thing, natural selection, set at rest the doctrine of special creation. In combination with our knowledge of Mendelian inheritance acquired since Darwin's day, it rendered obsolete such alternative theo­ries of evolution as were based on extra-mechanical agencies, or on di­rect adaptation of organisms to their immediate environment (that is, on inheritance of acquired characters), and exposed them as sins against Occam's razor. Natural selection furnished the binding principle for a general or unified theory of historical change in the living world (Lerner, 1959, p. 173).



Lerner felt so confident that he proclaimed natural selection necessarily dominant a priori, not merely validated by evidence: “There is no longer any doubt that natural selection is more than a theoretical possibility — it is un­questionably a logically imperative necessity in any accounting for evolution” (1959, p. 174). He acknowledges, of course, that selection cannot manufac­ture, but can only shape, the physical material of organisms, but he compares selection's role to Michelangelo's claim that a great sculptor works to liberate beautiful forms from the blocks of stone that begin as their raw material — a lovely, poetic rendition of the standard argument for selection's creativity (see Chapter 2). In so doing, Lerner trivializes the role of potential constraints, even suggesting that a sow's ear might not represent an impossible starting point for a silk purse:

In the same way, natural selection does not originate its own building blocks in the form of mutations of genes. But from them it does create complexes; it solves in a diversity of ways the great variety of problems that successful individuals and populations face; it builds step by step, even if by trial and error, entities of infinite complexity, ingenuity, and be one inclined to say so, beauty. Granted that it needs appropriate raw ma­terials, that it may not necessarily be able to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear; yet, interacting with other evolutionary mechanisms, it has created the human species out of stuff which in its primordial stage may have looked no more promising (1959, p. 179).



Lerner's conclusion bears more than a whiff of similarity to the apostolic creed, suitable for multiple repetition by the faithful: “Evolution is the most fundamental biological law yet discovered. Natural selection is the basic mechanism implementing it. The principle of descent with modification, creatively, albeit opportunistically, husbanded by natural selection, is as firmly established as any concept in biology” (1959, pp. 181-182). (I don't disagree with the content; I just don't feel fully at ease with the triumphalist presen­tation.)

If Lerner verges on the overconfident, some centennial expressions treated any conceivable alternative with disdain. I have already cited Mayr's as­sertion of “complete unanimity” in competent professional opinion and of the “colossal ignorance” of remaining doubters. In Chicago, Mayr even re­sorted to theological language in citing “the opposing evils of Lamarckism and saltationism” (Mayr, 1960, p. 350). Others noted, but with some sense of unfairness, the vilification of Lamarck. C. H. Waddington regretted that “Lamarck is the only major figure in the history of biology whose name has become, to all intents and purposes, a term of abuse” (1960, p. 383); while Marston Bates noted that “Lamarck remains some kind of horrible example of wrong thinking in the introductory textbooks” (1960, p. 548).

But the prevailing tenor of these symposia does not display pugnaciousness towards opponents (which would imply an existing and meaningful conflict of uncertain resolution), but smugness in the confidence that a total victory has, at last, been achieved after a long battle (cigars and a drink around the fireplace at night, to cite an androphilic metaphor of past and privileged generations). Evolutionary theory is now essentially complete; we know how the process works and now only need to supply some details. G. G. Simpson had written in a 1950 essay (reprinted in Simpson, 1964, p. 14): “This general theory is now supported by an imposing array of paleontologists, geneticists, and other biological specialists. Differences of opinion on relatively minor points naturally persist and many details remain to be filled in, but the es­sentials of the explanation of the history of life have probably now been achieved.”

The Chicago symposiasts continually asserted their agreement with this confident consensus. Tinbergen spoke of “the all-pervading power of selec­tion” (1960, p. 609). Huxley (in Tax and Callender, 1960, volume 3, p. 45) defined the future task of evolutionary biology as filling in the blanks: “We are no longer having to bother about establishing the fact of evolution, and we know that natural selection is the major factor causing evolutionary change. Our problems now concern working out in detail how natural selec­tion operates, defining what we mean by 'increase of organization,' tracing the general trends that appear in the course of evolution, and so on.” He then described the range of phenomena that selection can fashion — in short, every­thing that might happen in evolution! “It produces branching; it produces in­creasing adaptation, improvement, progress, or whatever you like to call it; and it produces horizontal persistence of branches, or stabilization” (in Tax and Callender, 1960, volume 3, p. 139).

I argued in the last section that “hardening” of the Synthesis gains clearest expression in an increasing faith that adaptation must be both the impetus and result of nearly any evolutionary change. The 1959 symposia continually stress this theme. Panadaptationism became a premise for Chicago's major panel discussion on “the evolution of life,” not an issue to be adjudicated by participants. Panelists received a list of assumptions, including the statement that “transformation always leads to adaptive or, better, teleonomic results” (in Tax and Callender, 1960, volume 3, p. 109).

Confidence in adaptation grew so great that many symposiasts presented their arguments in a “can't fail” manner, by delimiting a set of supposedly in­clusive outcomes, each validating adaptation for any conceivable result.* Mayr, for example, argued that the general ecological rules of Bergmann and others enjoy good adaptive explanations, but that the numerous exceptions also affirm adaptation because local (and opposite) factors can override the general trend: “In recent years the analysis of these rules has shown that, as we stressed earlier, all phenotypes are compromises among a variety of con­flicting selection pressures. As a result, there are many so-called exceptions to such rules, where a new selection pressure takes over and adjusts an organism or a local population in a different way” (in Tax and Callender, 1960, volume 3, p. 138).

In another example of victory by virtual definition, Tinbergen acknowl­edged that randomness might provide a theoretical alternative to adaptation in the evolution of a behavior. But since he construed randomness only as an absence of evidence for selection, and since he regarded the variety of con­ceivable adaptationist explanations as effectively inexhaustible, how would one ever validate randomness in any particular case? “This task [of explain­ing the results of evolution] really amounts to an assessment of the relative importance of the contribution made by random variation, on the one hand, and by adaptation directed by selection, on the other. Since randomness is, per definition, detectable only by elimination of every conceivable directed-ness, it is natural that this approach should lead to a quest for directedness” (Tinbergen, 1960, p. 602).

Adaptation pervades Tinbergen's discourse and world of thought. He even proposes a turnabout from Darwin's own, eminently sensible, view that non-adaptive features of conservative inheritance (deep homologies) provide opti­mal characters for taxonomic definition, since more recent adaptations tend to be homoplastic (as easily convergeable with similar features in indepen­dent lineages) and nondistinctive. Tinbergen, on the other hand, states that his paper will focus upon “the extent to which taxonomic characters must be assumed to be due to natural selection” (1960, p. 595). He then carries his adaptationist paean even further by arguing that evolutionists (as opposed to other scientists who might need to classify for different reasons) must divide organisms and designate their characters in terms of adaptive complexes, thus assuring his preferred interpretation by predefining the structure of ob­servation itself:

The conclusion that adapted features are systems of functionally related components forces us to reconsider once more the question What is a taxonomic character? The answer is, of course, that it depends on the aims, which the scientist has in mind. The classifier is fully entitled to use, e.g., the tameness of the kittiwakes, their nest-building behavior, the black neckband of their young, and their nidicolous habits as four sepa­rate characters. But the evolutionist is not entitled to treat them as four independent characters. To him, the correct description of the characteristics of the species would be in terms of adapted systems, such as (1) cliff breeding; (2) pelagic feeding; (3) orange inside of the mouth and related characteristics of posturing (Tinbergen, 1960, p. 609).



These symposia not only featured adaptation as the centerpiece of the biological world, but also extended the concept to all other fields included within their program of lectures. Robert McC. Adams, then a young anthropology professor at Chicago, but later the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, confessed an initial skepticism about the symposium, based on “uncertainty about finding anything in common to talk about with representatives of other disciplines” (in Tax and Callender, 1960, volume 3, p. 268). But he dis­covered relevance in learning to view human societies as “adaptive mecha­nisms,” and in using this idea to grant an “evolutionary role” to culture, thus equating adaptation with the entire realm of potential evolutionary insight:

As man evolves, he superadds culture to his genetic equipment, and by this new addition he is enabled to adapt in a whole series of much more effective and complex ways — to spread himself over the entire globe, to construct very complex societies, and, in fact, frequently to direct the evolution of species all around him. Human societies are adaptive mechanisms; they have to be understood as having an evolutionary role rather than as uniquely human creations that are not to be compared with the evolutionary development of other organisms (Adams in Tax and Callender, 1960, volume 3, p. 268).



Only one “interloper,” historian Ilza Veith, dared to suggest that nonadaptive phenomena might be important in evolution, but Julian Huxley firmly dismissed these worries:

Veith: In my field, perhaps the most rewarding line would be to find those moments or those evolutionary processes that will present weak­nesses, where maladaptation will occur, and where the mind will not continue to function in its normal manner.

Huxley: I am sorry you wish to concentrate on maladaptation. I should think it would be much better to concentrate on adaptation from the positive angle (Tax and Callender, 1960, volume. 3, p. 269).



Sweetness surely triumphed in Chicago, but perhaps at the expense of light. The panel discussions ended in a virtual orgy of agreement, with Darwin as hero and adaptation as king. Even Sewall Wright, who had approached selec­tion with ambiguity for years but had finally made his peace with the hard­ened consensus (though in his own idiosyncratic way — see pp. 522–524), ended his paper by writing: “From a more general standpoint, all of this is merely an elaboration in terms of modern genetics of the conception of evolu­tion by natural selection advanced by Darwin in the Origin of Species a hun­dred years ago” (Wright, 1960, p. 471). Wright became even more accom­modating in his role on the “evolution of life” panel. As the discussion wound down, Wright presented a simple comment as a last word before Julian Huxley's summary: “I agree with everybody.”

Yet a bit of rain, as our mottoes proclaim, must fall on any long parade. One skeptic and whistle blower did speak out in Chicago, unsurprisingly a paleontologist who doubted the sufficiency of synthetic adaptationism as a complete explanation for the fullness of events in geological time. The Ameri­can vertebrate paleontologist E. C. Olson had become disturbed by the in­creasingly dogmatic, peremptory, and exclusivist tone that many synthesists had adopted in this period of hardening. He spoke, with some irony, of the consensus that “has come to be known as the 'synthetic theory of evolution' but has also been variously termed 'selection theory,' 'neo-Mendelian theory,' and 'neo-Darwinian theory.' It is unfortunate that occasionally it is called 'the theory of evolution,' as if no other could exist” (Olson, 1960, p. 524).

Olson then identified three aspects of the logic and sociology of the syn­thetic theory that, in veering towards dogmatism, made him uncomfortable. First, the theory had become flexible enough to encompass all possible results almost a priori, thus setting itself no challenges for potential refutation:

The feeling of a slight sense of frustration in the elasticity involved in developing a universal explanation is hard to avoid . . . There is little or nothing that cannot be explained under the selection theory, and, at pres­ent, this theory appears to be unique in this respect (1960, p. 530) . . . This possible danger is amply revealed in some studies of the last decade which seem more concerned with fitting results into the current theory than with evaluation of results in terms of a broader outlook. Further, of course, much research is conceived and carried out within the frame­work of the theory, and, no matter what its excellence, is not likely to break out of this framework (1960, p. 536).



Second, the synthesists themselves often haughtily dismiss those who disagree as misguided, if not obtuse: “The statement is made, in effect, that those who do not agree with the synthetic theory do not understand evolution and are incapable of so doing, in most cases because they think typologically . . . Some avid proponents of the synthetic theory would appear to ... eliminate as competent students of evolution, because of their inability to understand the theory, those who may disagree” (1960, pp. 526-527; Olson's italics).

Third, the success of consensus and consequent derision has silenced most doubters, but their numbers may be large and their questions cogent: “There exists, as well, a generally silent group of students engaged in biological pur­suits who tend to disagree with much of the current thought but say and write little ... It is, of course, difficult to judge the size and composition of this si­lent segment, but there is no doubt that the numbers are not inconsiderable. Wrong or right as such opinion may be, its existence is important and cannot be ignored or eliminated as a force in the study of evolution” (1960, pp. 523-524). As a paleontologist, Olson expressed most unhappiness with the “con­sistency argument” that awarded the synthetic theory hegemony over all scales of macroevolution — a misplaced confidence achieved by extrapolating, by fiat more than by evidence, a process that undoubtedly works in the ecological here and now to a sufficient explanation for all major changes oc­curring over hundreds of millions of years (1960, pp. 531 and 533).

Yet, however cogent Olson's doubts, his attempt to inject more pluralism and skepticism into evolutionary theory ultimately failed — and for a valid reason from the orthodox point of view. A successful whistle blower must proceed beyond the exposure of faults in his boss's domain; he must also sug­gest a path towards greater accuracy and fuller explanation. And, on this constructive side, Olson could offer nothing. He ventured a few comments about cytoplasmic inheritance as a possible mechanism that might not follow all synthetic rules, but such a limited and inadequate speculation could not fuel such a comprehensive set of doubts! Revisionists would gain no hearing until they could propose an extensive and positive set of extensions or alter­natives — and I write this book because I believe that such an affirmative pro­gram has now been formulated. Olson's critique achieved no currency, and the hardened version descended from the empyrean academy into the vernac­ular world of textbooks, the ultimate test of establishment by social imposi­tion as well as by professional consensus.





ALL QUIET ON THE TEXTBOOK FRONT





Professional writing tends to be nuanced and judicious. Even the strongest partisan finesses his commitment and adds at least a footnote or tangential comment, so that any charge of oversimplification or dogmatism may be countered by stating: “but look on page 381 (in the small print); you see, I raised that caveat myself.”

To learn the unvarnished commitments of an age, one must turn to the textbooks that provide “straight stuff” for introductory students. Yes, text­books truly oversimplify their subjects, but textbooks also present the central tenets of a field without subtlety or apology — and we can grasp thereby what each generation of neophytes first imbibes as the essence of a field. Moreover, many textbooks boast authorship by the same professionals who fill their technical writings with exceptions, caveats, and complexities.

I have long felt that surveys of textbooks offer our best guide to the central convictions of any era. What single line could be more revealing, more at­tuned to the core commitment of a profession that bathed in the blessings of Victorian progressivism, and aspired to scientific status in Darwin's century, than the epigram that Alfred Marshall placed on the title page to innumerable editions of his canonical textbook, Principles of Economics: “natura non facit saltum.”

The changing foci of 20th century textbooks provide direct insight into the history of evolutionary thought and the eventual triumph of Darwinism. In particular, if the Synthesis truly hardened, as I have argued, then texts fol­lowing the 1959 centennial celebrations — the apogee of strict selectionism — should describe evolution in unambiguously panadaptationist language, and should extol the sufficiency of natural selection to craft the entire range of evolutionary phenomena at all scales, ecological to geological.

This section does not present a systematic survey of texts, though I have consulted everything I could find, including nearly all-major American books for introductory college biology (and several high school textbooks as well). A more complete search, extended back in time to cover the early days of the Synthesis, and the pre-synthetic period as well, would provide a fascinating topic for a dissertation in the history of science or education. This field of ver­nacular expression has been neglected by scholars, though the subject would yield great insight (for such material obviously represents the only formal contact that most students ever receive with any given discipline).

I apologize for my almost anecdotal approach, but I think that I have identified a robust pattern supporting the hypothesis of hardening. I will focus on the two topics that authors of texts found most congenial in their efforts to explain synthetic evolutionism to introductory audiences: the centrality of adaptation, and the sufficiency of synthetic microevolution to explain events at all scales. (I consider here only the evolution chapters of comprehensive bi­ology texts for introductory courses, not entire textbooks on evolution. These short, unvarnished and straight-line accounts of adaptation and extrapola­tion appear in the context of such epitomes. Full texts on evolution, which cannot be called “introductory” or “elementary” (for such courses have al­ways been taught at intermediate or advanced levels in American universi­ties), do treat the subject more comprehensively, with a proper listing, often called “textbooky” in our jargon, of divergent views.)





Adaptation and natural selection


In this age of sound bites, even short chapters include final summaries to tell students the pith of what they must remember. Consider the following from Nelson, Robinson, and Boolootian (1967, p. 249), written to summarize a chapter entitled “Evolution, Evidences and Theories.” I cite the entire state­ment, not an excerpt:

Principles

1. Charles Darwin proposed a theory of evolution based on variation, competition, and consequent natural selection.

2. The basic mechanism of evolution is now known to be changes in gene frequencies of populations through time, guided by natural selec­tion.



On the subject of exclusivity, Darling and Darling (1961, p. 199) tell us “any organism is a bundle of interacting adaptations. Most all the fea­tures of all living things are adaptations.” Howells (1959, p. 24), a great evo­lutionary anthropologist publishing his popular text in Darwin's centennial year, discussed natural selection with his usual panache and good humor, but also in the all-encompassing celebratory mode: “So much for natural selec­tion, the external force, that finger beckoning to the otherwise unguided he­redity of an animal type. All other principles and facts of evolution may be satisfactorily related to it or explained by it, and the century following 1859 has seen Darwin triumphant.”

Simpson, Pittendrigh and Tiffany (1957, p. 405), an excellent text that dominated the market for years (and featured a leading architect of the Syn­thesis as first author), also stated that any nonrandom evolution must be adaptive: “The evolutionary changes that result from nonrandom reproduc­tion are clearly adaptive: the changes are always, necessarily, of such a kind as to improve the average ability of the population to survive and reproduce in the environments that they inhabit.”

Many paeans to adaptation proceeded beyond mere claims about omnipresence to assert optimalized excellence, or near organic perfection, as well. Convictions about the exclusive power (as well as the range) of natural selec­tion emerge most clearly from such statements, as by Telford and Kennedy (1965, p. 3) (Kennedy later became the president of Stanford University and editor of Science magazine):

It is of profound importance for the nature of the organism that, due to natural selection, the evolutionary changes in organisms have either moved relentlessly in the direction of efficiency or have kept them at­tuned to a changing environment... Evolutionary adaptation thus sug­gests an extremely fine attunement between organism and environment. The organism doesn't merely get along; its whole life mode has been tem­pered and refined by the successful competition of generations of its an­cestors with a multitude of differing genotypes. Thus even in the finest details of their organization, organisms are constructed and operate in a manner which makes sense in terms of the way they make their living.



From this assertion of omnipresence for adaptation in morphologies, physiologies and behaviors of the moment, these texts then proceed to ascribe the second great phenomenon of evolution — the production of diversity — to nat­ural selection as well. Simpson et al. (1957, p. 405) extend selection's scope to all phenomena at all scales by writing: “The evolutionary process, viewed in broad perspective, is characterized by two major features: it produces diver­sity among living things, and it gives rise to their adaptation, their fitness to survive and reproduce efficiently in the environments they inhabit. These two features are interdependent: life's diversity is largely a diversity in adapta­tion.”

Speciation, although replete with nonadaptive elements in Mayr's canoni­cal formulation, usually receives a textbook description as an even stronger affirmation of natural selection (because the process now operates in two sep­arated lines, working its differential effects to produce just the right adapta­tions in both distinct and varying environments). Nelson et al. entitling their section “Speciation: The Results of Adaptation,” write in summary (1967, p. 235): “Natural selection operating on the variability present in the geno­types of populations can cause better adaptation of organisms to their envi­ronment. Coupled with reproductive isolation, these adaptations bring about speciation.”

Jones and Gaudin (1977, p. 548) introduce their discussion of speciation with a scenario of pure adaptation and extrapolation. (Their full text dis­cusses other mechanisms, including polyploidy — but note the pride of place awarded to adaptation, and the argument that so separate and important a phenomenon as geographic isolation only provides an impetus by setting new selection pressures in a different environment):

The accumulation of adaptations can lead to the production of new spe­cies, a process called speciation.... Suppose a population of gophers living in a valley is divided in two by a river that cuts a channel through their valley. The two segments of the population are now effectively sep­arated from one another, and any environmental differences that exist between the two regions of the valley will result in adaptations restricted to one side or the other of the river.... Different selective pressures now will be operating on opposite sides of the river. Given sufficient time, the two gopher populations may diverge quite extensively.



With speciation thus explained as an extended consequence of adaptation under certain environmental circumstances, the same argument can then be smoothly extended to life's full pattern in geological time. Alexander (1962, p. 826) tells students that all phylogeny flows from “the fact of adaptation.” I can hardly imagine a more gradualistic and meliorist account of evolution, with all death for improved existence, and all life in continual motion to­wards more and better:

We need only accept the fact of adaptation — the idea that organisms are fitted for the particular environments in which they live — to see the necessity for a process of organic evolution. The environment in which organisms live has not been constant . . . Organisms, of course, do not exist under conditions for which they are not adapted. They have, there­fore, met these various conditions at different times and places; in order to persist under a changing environment they themselves have had to change. We may think of organic evolution, therefore, as the progressive change of plants and animals in harmony with the changes in their envi­ronments. The unadapted die out and disappear. Those organisms whose descendants can fit into the new conditions survive, expand in numbers and kinds, and take over the changing habitat.





Reduction and trivialization of macroevolution


The hypothesis of selection's Allmacht, and adaptation's ubiquity, rests upon the validity of extrapolation to the full range of geological time, for what power (or generality) can a well-formulated theory of local adaptation assert if the same process, by uniformitarian extension, cannot explain the origin of multicellularity, the rise of mammals, and the eventual emergence of human intelligence? Paradoxically perhaps, this extrapolationist assertion becomes, at the same time, the most vulnerable and the most essential of all synthetic propositions — vulnerable in necessary reliance upon a “consistency argu­ment” in the absence of empirical proof, and essential because the theory be­comes such a paltry and limited device if its explanatory range cannot extend beyond the compass of its directly observable effects.

No evolutionary assertion has been more commonly advanced in text­books, or more superficially (and almost nonchalantly) proclaimed by fiat, than the claim that adaptation by natural selection must be fully sufficient to render life's entire history. In the last section, I documented the “promotion” of arguments about pervasiveness of adaptation in local circumstances, to speciation, to the entire tree of life. Capping this sequence, Howells (1959, p. 28) writes, “all this exploring, stopping, and rushing, in the pursuit of profitable adaptation, has resulted in the great family tree of the animals.”

Nelson et al. (1967, p. 239) briefly extol the full sequence — from the rule of selection in local populations, through speciation, to the origin and di­versification of phyla: “Evolution in its simplest and broadest sense means changes in gene frequency over a period of time. Natural selection guides these changes . . . Over long periods the accumulation of changes may be suf­ficient to separate once similar populations into distinct groups. In the course of evolutionary history this divergence has apparently led to different classes (mammals, birds, fish, etc.), different phyla (insects and corals, for example), and even different kingdoms (plants and animals).”

The dominant high school text of the 1960's and 70's depicts the standard equine example of macroevolution as anagenetic gradualism guided by natu­ral selection, thus making any definition of chronospecies arbitrary: “The fos­sil record shows that all these differences are the result of a series of many gradual changes. Each change that became established through natural selec­tion must have been very slight; only when many such changes accumulated did they result in detectable differences. How can this long sequence of horses be divided into species?” (Biological Sciences Curriculum Study, Green Ver­sion, 1973, p. 621). The accompanying figure of the phylogeny of horses de­picts the actual (and copiously branching) bush as a smooth ladder of prog­ress (see Fig. 7-3).

Bonner (1962, pp. 52-53), another leading evolutionist who also wrote a popular text, argued that paleontologists can't study the mechanics of evolu­tion directly, but professed complete confidence in the efficacy of microevolutionary selection:

Paleontologists as well as ecologists have been for some years studying the evolutionary factors we have discussed, and have continuously at­tempted to see how the fossil record, on the one hand, or the present-day distribution of animals and plants, on the other, fit in with this scheme. There seem to be no major discrepancies, and a general feeling that the mechanism of evolution is understood prevails, particularly in regard to the importance of selection and the method of formation of new species... Some groups such as the mollusks have been exceedingly slow in their progress while others, such as the mammals, have been very rapid. Again this can be totally understood in terms of selection in particular environments. No other hypothetical mechanisms seem to be necessary to account for the facts, as we know them.



Such confidence in microevolutionary sufficiency can only lead to a down­grading of paleontology — either to theoretical irrelevance, or to a status as a mere repository for results of processes that can only be elucidated by study­ing modern organisms (and may then be smoothly extrapolated across a mil­lion millennia). I do not think that this derogatory judgment originated by the conscious intent of most textbook authors. Rather, the marginalization of paleontology flows directly from the logic of pure extrapolation. The basic







7-3. Standard textbook misdepiction of a copiously branching evolutionary lineage as a ladder of progress. This canonical view of the evolution of horses appeared in the 1973 Green Version of the most popular and most widely respected high school textbook produced by the Biological Sciences Cvrriculum Study.





argument takes two forms. Some authors explicitly exclude paleontology from the theoretical game:

Evolution can be studied on the population level only with living organisms. The fossil record provides too few data to allow such treatment; it merely allows paleontologists to reconstruct the history of animal and plant groups. The population approach makes it possible to ask such questions as: what is the rate of evolution in a given species? What fac­tors influence the course or rate of evolution? What conditions are neces­sary for evolution to begin or cease? (Baker and Allen, 1968, p. 524). [I do not see why paleontologists cannot address all three of these ques­tions with data from the morphology of fossils and their temporal distri­bution.]



But I must confess that a stronger and more focused form of this argument has long evoked my deeper distress, and has served, in substantial measure, as the impetus for personal career choices in research, and for my eventual deci­sion to write this book. I refer to the claim, repeated almost as a catechism, and obviously copied from textbook to textbook, that macroevolution poses no problem not resolvable by a further understanding of allelic substitutions directed by natural selection in contemporary populations. We may move smoothly from one gene to an entire Bauplan, and extrapolate upwards from a few generations to a geological era. No additional problems arise in tempo­ral vastness. Macroevolution becomes little more than industrial melanism writ large. But can we even imagine, in a world dominated by effects of scale, that such a maximal extension of form and time will engage not a single force or principle beyond the factors fully in evidence at the lowest level? Can the smallest scales really provide an entirely sufficient model for the largest? Can a uniformitarianism this rigid truly be sustained? If so, then paleontology only represents a playground for the full display of microevolutionary mus­cle — and textbooks need not consider the fossil record as more than an ar­chive of the pathways carved by this power.

Most standard textbooks make this confident assertion based on little be­yond hope and tradition — thus making macroevolution a nonsubject. Bonner (1962, p. 48), for example, writes: “There is no reason to believe that these large changes are not the result of the very same mechanics of the small changes of industrial melanism. One involves a small step over a few years; the other involves many thousands of steps over millions of years.”

Curtis (1962, p. 712), in a best-selling text of the 60's, begins her short sec­tion on macroevolution by stating: “Can the same processes that slowly shape the seed of mustard weed or change the color of the peppered moth cre­ate the differences between elephants and daisies or between butterflies and redwood trees? Darwin believed so — all he felt that was needed was time, millions of years of slow change. Today, almost all evolutionists are, in princi­ple, in general agreement with Darwin's conclusions.”

Several texts even present this canonical argument as their only statement about macroevolution. I end this chapter by quoting two striking examples of this trivialization and marginalization of macroevolution, each from the most important source in its respective genre. As mentioned above, BSCS text­books (written by a semiofficial consortium of private and governmental sources, The Biological Sciences Curriculum Study) virtually cornered high-school markets during post-Sputnik years of the 1960's and 1970's. The 1968 version of Biological Science: An Inquiry Into Life includes a heading on “The Origin of Genera and Larger Groups.” But the text contains only two paragraphs, fully reproduced below:

The final question which we must ask about the forces of evolution is this: can mutation, recombination, selection, and barriers to cross-breed­ing explain the major trends of evolution, such as the divergence of cat­like from doglike animals and the evolution of the horse from its small primitive ancestors?

The mechanisms that govern these major trends of evolution cannot be studied directly: they took place many thousands or millions of years ago. Nevertheless, a study of populations today, and of fossils, provides strong evidence that the same evolutionary forces in operation today have guided evolution in the past. One species evolves into two (or more). All the new species continue to evolve, becoming more different from one another until eventually we would classify them as different genera (1968, p. 203).



Life on Earth (1973) surely ranks as the most distinguished textbook of introductory college biology published during the 1970's. Written by a team of eight authors, and headed by two of the world's leading evolutionists (E. O. Wilson and T. Eisner), this book staked an explicit claim for groundbreaking novelty by linking appropriate expertise at the highest level with accessibility in style, and excellence in design and illustration. Chapter 28 on “The Process of Evolution” ends with the heading “Macroevolution.” The quotation be­low may seem limited in content, particularly for a college text, but I do not cite an excerpt. I have reproduced the book's entire section on macro­evolution!

In this passage, the history of life becomes a simple extension of the story of the raspberry eye-color gene. (For the second edition, the authors switched to the standard case of industrial melanism, but did not alter the general ar­gument at all.) Paleontologists may be burdened with an incomplete record, the authors assert, but as they look more carefully, the gap between the rasp­berry gene and the Cambrian explosion closes continually. I can only express my astonishment at such a limited, but definitive, assertion by applying Ethel Barrymore's famous closing line to this dismissal of macroevolution as a sub­ject: “That's all there is, there isn't any more.”

Each of the examples of microevolution examined, involving shifts in the frequencies of small numbers of genes, could be multiplied a hundred­fold from reports in the scientific literature. Biologists have been privi­leged to witness the beginnings of evolutionary change in many kinds of plants and animals and under a variety of situations, and they have used this opportunity to test the assumptions of population genetics that form the foundations of modern evolutionary theory. The question that should be asked before we proceed to new ideas is whether more exten­sive evolutionary change, macroevolution, can be explained as an out­come of these microevolutionary shifts. Did birds really arise from rep­tiles by an accumulation of gene substitutions of the kind illustrated by the raspberry eye-color gene?

The answer is that it is entirely plausible, and no one has come up with a better explanation consistent with the known biological facts. One must keep in mind the enormous difference in time scale between the ob­served cases of microevolution and macroevolution. Under natural con­ditions the nearly complete substitution of the melanic gene of the pep­pered moth took 50 years. Evolution of the magnitude of the origin of the birds usually, perhaps invariably, takes many millions of years. As paleontologists explore the fossil record with increasing care, transitions are being documented between increasing numbers of species, genera, and higher taxonomic groups. The reading from these fossil archives suggests that macroevolution is indeed gradual, paced at a rate that leads to the conclusion that it is based upon hundreds or thousands of gene substitutions no different in kind from the ones examined in our case his­tories (1973, p. 792).



But, pace Ms. Barrymore, there is so much more — as research in the vi­brant field of macroevolution, filling the pages of numerous journals (all founded after these dismissive comments), attests; as the development of a tight and powerful theory of hierarchical selection embodies (see Chapters 8 and 9); as the union of developmental with evolutionary biology displays (see Chapters 10 and 11); as our advancing understanding of genomic complexity asserts. Can we not feel the frustration of E. C. Olson as he queried the titans of the Modern Synthesis in Chicago? Can we not understand why a few icon­oclasts never made their peace with such a comfortable and limiting ortho­doxy? Can we not gain a visceral (and not only an intellectual) sense of C. H. Waddington's isolation and irritation when he made his famous comment on the limitations of population genetics (Waddington, 1967), and won admira­tion for his panache but no consideration for his content: “The whole real guts of evolution — which is, how do you come to have horses and tigers, and things — is outside the mathematical theory.”











Segue to Part Two





Contemporary challenges to all three central commitments of Darwinism (the legs of the tripod in my chosen metaphor, or the “essence” of the theory in the legitimate use of a word generally shunned by evolutionary biologists) prompted me to write this book. Such forms of debate set the mainsail of scholarly life, and cynics may be excused for suspecting the academic equiva­lent of glitz and grandstanding when their colleagues proclaim major unhappiness with received wisdom. This cynicism merits special attention when Charles Darwin serves as a target — for the demise of Darwinism has been trumpeted more often than the guard changes at Buckingham Palace, not­withstanding the evident fact that both seem to stand firm as venerable Brit­ish institutions. (I state nothing new here: Kellogg (1907) began his won­derful book, the basis for my style of exposition, by refuting a German proclamation, then current, about the Sterbelager, or death-bed, of Darwin­ism — see Dennert, 1904, for an English translation of the book that inspired Kellogg's long and celebrated rejoinder.)

If continuity breeds respect — and what other criterion could an evolution­ist propose in this volatile vale of tears? — then the most persuasive rejoinder to a charge of superficial and ephemeral grandstanding must lie in the docu­mentation of long persistence and serious attention for a given critique. Per­sistence, of course, need not imply cogency; Lord only knows the lengthy pedigree of stupidity. But an analog to natural selection also operates in the world of ideas, and truly silly notions do get weeded out at certain levels of intellectual competence. Moreover, only a small subset of our forebears ranks as brilliant thinkers. When we can designate a critique as both longstanding in general and seriously supported by scholars in this subset, then such argu­ments should command our respect and attention. (Brilliance, of course, only implies cogency, not correctness. Cultural biases and simple lack of informa­tion can lead even the most gifted minds to firm convictions that seem risible today. But I do assert that brilliant scholars, while often as wrong as anyone else, devise their positions for interesting and instructive reasons. We may now reject Lyell's strict views about substantive uniformity, and Paley will find few modern devotees for his natural theology. But we must not write these men off — and we will learn much by studying the reasons for their distinctive attitudes.)

In this context, I ask readers to consider two points about the tripod of necessary support for Darwinism:

First, even during the period of current orthodoxy, beginning with the coalescence and spread of the Modern Synthesis; the three supports have never been particularly firm, or adequately defended. The first support — restriction of selection to the organismal level — received little explicit defense, but rather prevailed in a fuzzy sort of way by convention in practice. Sloppy statements implying group selection abounded in the literature (as documented in Chap­ter 7, pp. 544–556), and some disciplines, notably the classical ethology of Lorenz and his disciples, frequently cited arguments about supraorganismal selection without understanding their consequences for Darwinian the­ory. This situation changed dramatically when Wynne-Edwards (1962) ad­vanced his explicit argument for group selection at a predominant relative frequency — and Williams (1966) wrote his spirited defense of the Darwinian straight and narrow by setting out the centrality of organismal selection so forcefully.

The second support — the validation of selection as a nearly exclusive mechanism of evolutionary change, as embodied in the adaptationist pro­gram — received strong verbal approbation, and elegant illustration in a few cases, but won orthodox status largely as a bandwagon effect prompted by the urgings of a few central figures, notably Mayr and Dobzhansky, and the subsequent acquiescence of most professionals to the assertion of such lead­ing figures, and not to the data of convincing demonstrations (see Chapter 7 for a detailed defense of this claim, as embodied in my hypothesis on the “hardening” of the Modern Synthesis). In particular, taxonomic orthodoxy just before the Synthesis (Kinsey, 1936; Robson and Richards, 1936) re­garded most geographic variation within species as nonadaptive. The oppo­site opinion triumphed as the Synthesis reached a height of prestige and or­thodoxy, but few actual cases had been overturned by data. Rather, a shifting theoretical preference led to assertions of dominant relative frequency based on documentation inadequate to affirm either view. (I do not regard earlier arguments for nonadaptation as inherently more cogent. On the contrary, I am convinced that we still have no good idea about the relative frequencies of adaptive and nonadaptive effects in geographic variation. I only claim that the shift to adaptationist preferences resulted more from a bandwagon effect than from direct evidence — and that this second leg of the tripod therefore never enjoyed adequate buttressing.)

The third support — extrapolation, explicitly discussed here in terms of the surrogate proposition of geological uniformity, and so necessary to provide a stage that would nurture, or at least not disrupt, Darwin's hope for explain­ing the entire history of life by “pure” extension of principles derived from the small and palpable — prevailed more by assumption than by active valida­tion, with Kelvin's defeat and Rutherford's proof of the earth's great age read as adequate defense (a logically insufficient argument, by the way, because time may be long, but change still concentrated in rare catastrophic episodes). By the largely arbitrary and contingent sociology of disciplines, paleontology belonged to the geologists, and students of fossils therefore received virtually no training in evolution. With few exceptions, notably the work of G. G. Simpson, paleontology (at least during the first half of the 20th century) played little role in the development of a theory to account for its own subject matter.

Second, and more important in summarizing the first half of this book: not only can we identify basic logical weaknesses in standard defenses for the three Darwinian supports, but cogent critiques have also been persistent, in­deed omnipresent though changing in form, throughout the history of evolu­tionary thought. These histories may not be widely known to current practi­tioners, but the best minds of our profession have struggled continuously with themes of the essential tripod — and their arguments deserve our atten­tion and respect. (Without this knowledge, we tend to imbue orthodoxies with false permanence or, even worse, to lose sight of basic principles in the surrounding silence, thereby converting dubious but central postulates into hidden assumptions. History can and should be liberating.)

For the first leg of the tripod of essential support, hierarchy theory and multiple levels of selection do not represent only a modern gloss upon Dar­winism. Rather, contemporary versions of these concepts have reinvigorated the oldest issue of our profession. In Chapter 3, I showed that the first two evolutionary systems well known to English-speaking naturalists — Lamarck's and Chambers's — relied on a causal hierarchy that contrasted progress with diversification. Darwin explicitly combatted these ideas with a single-level theory based on extrapolating the small and observable results of natural se­lection, operating on organisms in local populations, to render all evolution­ary phenomena at all scales of time and effect. Weismann, and Darwin him­self as he struggled to explain diversity, then considered hierarchical models of selection formulated very much in the spirit of modern versions. Weis­mann, after much internal debate, leading to eventual rejection of his previ­ous commitment to the strict Darwinism of single-level selection on organ­isms alone, eventually advocated a full hierarchy of levels, explicitly citing this concept as the most distinctive innovation and centerpiece of his mature evolutionary views.

The internalist critique of adaptationism (the main subject of modern criti­cism on the second, or “creativity,” leg of the tripod) boasts an even more venerable pedigree. I showed, in Chapters 4 and 5, how this critique defined the major difference between British (Paleyan) and continental versions of natural theology in preevolutionary days. I then demonstrated that the same division, transformed as the structuralist-functionalist dichotomy, served as a focus for evolutionary debate — pitting the functionalism (adaptationism) of such disparate theories as Darwinian selectionism and Lamarckian soft inher­itance against the great continental schools of structuralism, as advocated by such scientists as Goethe (and most of the German Naturphilosophen), Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (and the French transcendental morphologists), and, in a rare move across the Channel, in major themes of the complex and much misunderstood evolutionary views of Richard Owen. Finally, I traced the two major lines of post-Darwinian internalist thought (orthogenesis and saltationism), and documented the continuity of this pedigree, after the Mendelian rediscovery, in the macromutationism of Hugo de Vries and (combining both strands of constraint and saltation) in the apostasy of Richard Goldschmidt. Modern critiques of adaptationism rest upon an ancient legacy.

For the third leg of extrapolationism, as illustrated here by the surrogate theme of Darwin's geological needs (for the other major aspects of extrapolationism fall into the theoretical domains of the first two essential postulates), I showed, in Chapter 6, that classical catastrophism operated as good science, and also represented the literal empiricism of its time. I then argued that Lyell's uniformitarian victory arose largely as a triumph of skilled but dubi­ous rhetoric. The aspects of catastrophism that posed the strongest challenges to Darwin's ideas on the origin of macroevolutionary pattern never received a convincing critique, and have now experienced a legitimate rebirth in modern views on mass extinction.

Nonetheless, although each leg of the Darwinian tripod faces a venerable indictment from the fullness of history, the path of modern reform surely does not lie with these classical critiques, for each embodies fatal flaws in each of two debilitating ways:

Anchors in cultural biases. The attempt to validate human supe­riority by the doctrine of progress identifies the heaviest burden imposed by Western culture upon evolutionary views of all stripes. In their nineteenth century versions, all three critiques of the essential postulates of Darwinism sunk their major root (and fallacy) in the concept of progress. For the first leg, the original hierarchical models of Lamarck and Chambers construed their higher level of large-scale change as a force of progress orthogonal to a palpa­ble cause of local adaptation. For both Lamarck and Chambers, the two forces of general progress and local adaptation are not only geometrically or­thogonal (upwards vs. sidewards), but also conceptually opposed, as the lat­eral force “pulls” lineages from their upward course into dead ends of local specialization. For the second leg, most structuralist visions postulated an in­herent increase of complexity and progress mediated by laws of form and in­ternal principles of living matter. These internalist theories proved attractive because, in contrast with the Darwinian contingency of shifting local adapta­tion, they offered more promise as validations for the great psychic balm of progress. On the third leg, catastrophism might seem inherently opposed to ideas of regulated and predictable increase in life's complexity, but the classi­cal versions advocated an intimate connection between progressionism and paroxysmal change — for pre-Darwinian catastrophists generally postulated renewed faunas of increasing excellence after each episode of extinction. This theme became such an intrinsic component of classical catastrophism that many scholars now designate this movement as the “directionalist synthesis” or as “progressionism,” and not by the paroxysmal dynamics of catastrophic change.

Failures of logic. The three critiques, in their nineteenth century versions, are explicitly anti-Darwinian. That is, they propose alternative causes of evolution that either deny natural selection entirely, or demote Dar­win's preferred cause to insignificance. These alternative forces are, in any case, opposed to — clearly not synergistic with — Darwin's principle of natural selection at the organismic level.

The explicit, often vociferous, invocation of these critiques against Darwinism set the primary agenda for scientific debate from the very beginning of modern evolutionary theory. On the first leg, the Lamarck-Chambers tra­dition of a primary force of progress (effectively inaccessible to empirical study), opposed to a palpable cause of immediate adaptation (eminently op­erational for research, but decidedly secondary in significance), acted as a ma­jor spur to Darwin's development of a fully operational theory with causes working at a single and accessible level. On the second leg, internalist notions of orthogenesis and saltation denied creativity to natural selection and de­fined the major versions of late 19th century anti-Darwinism. On the third leg, classical catastrophism became Darwin's personal bete noire, an obstacle that he surmounted by allegiance to Lyellian uniformity. Later in Darwin's ca­reer, the appearance of a similar threat in a different guise — the claim for an earth too young to render the results of evolution by natural selection in a gradualistic mode — led Darwin to characterize Lord Kelvin as an “odious specter.”

I believe that the historical tradition for using these critiques as supposed confutations of Darwinism has engendered a great deal of unnecessary and unproductive wrangling in our own time, as markedly different versions of the same critiques needlessly evoke old fears. I also believe that we can find the way to a better (and healing) taxonomy by following the lead of Kellogg's fine presentation (1907), already much praised in this book. Kellogg, as pre­viously discussed (pp. 163–169), divided critical commentary about Darwin­ism into arguments “auxiliary to” and “alternative to” natural selection — en­largements and confutations, if you will. In the past, critiques of the Darwinian tripod have usually been advocated in Kellogg's alternative, or de­structive, mode — and a tradition for quick (often ill-considered) and defen­sive reaction by Darwinians has developed whenever the critical buzz-words rise again: rapid change, group selection, mass extinction, directed mutation, for example. But all these critiques can also generate powerful versions in Kellogg's auxiliary, or helpful and expansive, mode — as Kellogg himself rec­ognized when he classified Weismann's theory of hierarchy as one of the two most significant auxiliary propositions of his time.

The older, alternative mode of these critiques did lead to a series of dead ends, rightly rejected by the resurgent Darwinism of the Modern Synthesis. Older versions of hierarchy (the first leg) foundered in the mysticism of super-organisms and harmonious ecologies; constraint and laws of form (the sec­ond leg) became mired in invalid macromutationism or lingering orthogene­sis; catastrophic geology (representing the third leg) languished in the failure of all proposed mechanisms for global paroxysm. The old versions, freighted by the cultural bias of progress, and rooted in false arguments for the demise of Darwinism, richly deserved the rejection they received.

But modern forms of these critiques are now being advanced in different and helpful versions within Kellogg's auxiliary mode — that is, as ideas to ex­pand, while substantially changing, the Darwinian core. For the first leg, and most importantly, the hierarchical theory of multi-level selection retains Dar­win's emphasis on the centrality of selection as a mechanism, but rejects the notion that the organismal level must hold nearly exclusive sway as a causal locus of change (while wondering if this conventional Darwinian level can even claim dominant status — Chapters 8 and 9). On the second leg, modern ideas of constraint and channeling deny the crucial isotropy of variation, so necessary to the logic of selection as the primary directional force in evolu­tion, and therefore envision important roles for structural and internal causes as patterning agents of evolutionary change (Chapters 10 and 11). These in­ternal channels work with selection as conduits for its impetus — that is, as auxiliary (not alternative) forces to natural selection. For the third leg, cur­rent notions of mass extinction do not challenge the Darwinian mechanism of selection per se, but suggest that any full explanation of macroevolutionary pattern must integrate the accumulated Darwinian effects of normal times with the profound restructurings of diversity that occur in environmental epi­sodes too rapid or too intense for adaptive response by many species and clades (Chapter 12).

Therefore, in modern versions of the three critiques, classical Darwinism either becomes expanded (in the theory of hierarchical selection), or dynami­cally counterposed with other causal forces working in concert with selection to produce the patterns of life's history, either at a conventional microevolutionary scale (internal channels as conduits for selection) or as interact­ing regimes through geological time (mass extinctions and selective replace­ments). But we cannot fairly portray these expanded views as pure sweetness and light for orthodox Darwinism. Much that has been enormously com­fortable must be sacrificed to accept this enlarged theory with a retained Dar­winian core — particularly the neat and clean, the simple and unifocal, no­tion that natural selection on organisms represents the cause of evolutionary change, and (by extrapolation) the only important agent of macroevolu­tionary pattern.

On the first leg, the theory of hierarchical selection differs substantially from classical Darwinism in basic logic and concept — for explanations of both stability and change must now be framed as compound results of a bal­anced interaction of levels, working in all possible ways (in concert, in con­flict, or orthogonally), and not as shifting optimalities built at a single level. On the second leg, an emphasis on constraints and channels implies a new set of operational concerns, and a revamping of the evolutionary research pro­gram. Internally imposed biases upon directions of change become a major subject for study — and the role of developmental patterns must again become prominent in evolutionary theory. (I must confess great personal pleasure in observing the rapid progress of this integration, as the wall between these two subjects seemed so frustratingly impenetrable when I published my first book, Ontogeny and Phylogeny, not so long ago in 1977.) On the third leg, a renewed appreciation for the shaping power of mass extinction must reinstate paleontology as a source of theory, and not merely a repository for the histor­ical unfolding of processes fully illuminated by microevolutionary studies. Thus, the new theory produced by the confluence of these critiques and their integration with classical Darwinism will not emerge from a simple act of generosity or noblesse oblige by previous orthodoxy. The new theory may re­main Darwinian in spirit (a “higher Darwinism,” see Gould, 1982b), but its development requires a wrenching from several key assumptions of classical Darwinism — not simply a smooth evolution from conventional precepts — as embodied in both the tripod of essential theoretical support, and the method­ology of uniformitarian extrapolation (the theoretical and methodological poles of Darwinism, as discussed in Chapter 2).

Substantial change in any domain usually follows such a scenario, and cannot unfold in smooth and untroubled gradualistic continuity. The venera­ble Hegelian triad of thesis ® antithesis ® synthesis may not adequately de­scribe all examples of important change (see p. 23 for more on this general concept), but this classic philosophical model of tension and (often episodic) resolution seems more in tune with nature — or, to use the terminology of this book, higher in relative frequency among patterns of change. Human thought, unlike the evolution of life, does include the prospect of meaningful progress as a predictable outcome, especially in science where increasingly better understanding of an external reality can impose a fundamental orga­nizing vector upon a historical process otherwise awash in quirks of indi­vidual personalities, and changing fashions of cultural preferences. Surely our views on the nature of taxonomic order have progressed (in the sense of better consonance with the true causes of diversity) from the eclecticism of Aldrovandi, to the coherent creationism of Linnaeus, to Cuvier's addition of a temporal dimension, to Darwin's evolutionary synthesis of space, form, and time.

The Hegelian triad proceeds by confrontation between old and new sys­tems (thesis and antithesis), and by their melding into a novel theory pre­serving worthy aspects of both — synthesis. But the continuing interplay of confrontation and reconstitution does not spin in an endless circle, preceding nowhere. Useful synthesis builds a transformed structure, and does not merely shuffle an unaltered deck (or raise an unstable house of cards pre­cariously built from unaltered parts). Darwin constructed a powerful anti­thesis to older evolutionary views rooted in predictable progress and internal drives. Modern versions of the three critiques now present a worthy antithe­sis to the limitations of strict Darwinism. The second part of this book pre­sents this Hegelian antithesis, written in the hope and expectation of synthe­sis and improvement. The synthesis that must eventually emerge will build a distinct theoretical architecture, offering renewed pride in Darwin's vision and in the power of persistent critiques — a reconstitution and an improve­ment, waiting for the next antithesis that must lead us onward to the next of many future syntheses in the wondrous, eternal play of mind and nature.
