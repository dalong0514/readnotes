## 0501The Fruitful Facets of Galton's

Polyhedron: Channels and Saltations

in Post-Darwinian Formalism





Galton's Polyhedron





Charles Darwin often remarked, as in the Descent of Man (1871, vol. 1, pp. 152-153), that he had pursued two different goals as his life's work: “I had two distinct objects in view; firstly, to show that species had not been sep­arately created, and secondly, that natural selection had been the chief agent of change.” Darwin spoke wisely (and practically) in these lines. He lies in Westminster Abbey for his unbounded success in the first endeavor; whereas, unbeknownst to many evolutionists who have experienced only the age of natural selection's triumph since the 1930's, Darwin's theory, his second en­deavor, never enjoyed much success in his lifetime, and never attracted more than a modest number of adherents. (The titles of Peter Bowler's excellent his­torical treatises on late 19th century evolutionary thought capture this para­dox well — The Eclipse of Darwinism, 1983; and The Non-Darwinian Revo­lution, 1988.)

As discussed in Chapter 2 (see pp. 137–141), Darwin's evolutionary critics encountered their greatest stumbling block in their inability to envision natu­ral selection as a creative force. Natural selection could surely serve as an executioner or headsman — the eliminator of the unfit. But such a negative role must occupy a distinctly secondary rank in the panoply of evolutionary forces. The central question of evolutionary theory remains: what creates the fit? The difficulty of this question, and the supposed inadequacy of natural se­lection as a solution, inspired a vast literature, including two famous Darwin­ian title parodies by two leaders of his opposition — The Origin of the Fittest (1887) by the American Neo-Lamarckian E. D. Cope, and The Genesis of Species (1871) by the British structuralist and saltationist St. George Mivart. (Darwin regarded Mivart's criticism as especially serious; the only chapter that he ever added to later editions of the Origin — Chapter 7 on “Miscel­laneous objections” — largely presents a rebuttal of Mivart's critique — see Chapter 11, pp. 1218–1224, for a full analysis.)

I cannot present a complete taxonomy of alternative proposals in late 19th century thought (lest this section become a multivolumed book in itself). I will, instead, commit the primary historical “sin” of self-serving retrospec­tion, and focus on those critiques of creativity that stressed formalist or structuralist themes now relevant in modern reformulations of evolutionary theory. Thus, I ignore several of the most important currents in late 19th cen­tury debate, particularly the strong Lamarckism of many thinkers, and the various threads of theistic and other forms of finalistic directionality.

Since Darwin's essential trio of assumptions about variability — copious, small, and undirected (see pp. 141–146) — does permit natural selection to act as the creative force of change, non-Darwinian alternatives, by logical neces­sity, deny one or more of these assertions. The diverse formalist theories of this chapter gain conceptual unity in granting directional power to internal factors, and not only to the interaction of environment with isotropic raw material. Darwinian claims for the small size and nondirectional character of variations become the obvious candidates for confutation — for formalist alternatives to these Darwinian bastions grant directional power to inter­nal causes (whereas a denial of the third claim of copiousness only places lim­its upon natural selection without supplying any substitute as a cause of change). Thus, in this late 19th century heyday of alternatives to Darwinism, formalist and structuralist thought centered upon claims for the evolutionary importance of saltational and directional variation.

The most striking model and epitome for this formalist opposition derives from a source that will strike many evolutionists as anomalous or paradoxi­cal — Darwin's brilliant and eccentric cousin Francis Galton. (The two men shared Erasmus Darwin as a grandfather, surely the most eminent member of the family before Charles himself.) Galton did study continuous variation extensively, and he therefore gained a reputation as guiding spirit for the lead­ing biometricians, Pearson and Weldon. Moreover, his long-term trumpeting of eugenic improvement also promoted the assumption that he favored insen­sibly gradual and continuous change in evolution.

But Galton, a pluralist in his views on evolutionary causality, viewed discontinuous variation as even more efficacious. Echoing Huxley's frequent plea to Darwin for a larger permissible size in useful variants (advice that Darwin explicitly rejected because he understood so well that the creativity of natural selection would be seriously compromised thereby), Galton wrote (1889, p. 32) that evolutionary theory “might dispense with a restriction for which it is difficult to see either the need or the justification, namely, that the course of evolution always proceeds by steps that are severally minute, and that become effective only through accumulation. That the steps may be small and that they must be small are very different views; it is only to the lat­ter that I object.”

We all recognize Galton's main contribution to the study of continuous variation in his recognition and elucidation of the crucial concept of regres­sion toward the mean. But Galton did not interpret regression in a modern genetic light. For him, regression guaranteed that continuous variation could not yield progressive evolutionary change, because all favorable extremes will, in subsequent generations, regress towards the mean, and no permanent or directional modification can therefore accrue. Substantial change to new “types” and taxa must occur by the occasional production of true-breeding “sports” — discontinuous variants that do not meld to intermediacy in hybrid offspring, and are therefore not subject to regression. In thus emphasizing “sports” for evolutionarily efficacious variation, and stability for taxa at other times (as regression to the mean holds continuous variants in check), Galton also became a hero of the early Mendelians, Bateson and de Vries, particularly for his role in formulating a general rationale for their non-Dar­winian concept of saltational origin for new species by macromutation.

Galton subsumed both non-Darwinian formalist themes of discontinuity in effective variation and internally-generated, preferred channels of change (constraints) in a brilliant metaphor that I have called “Galton's polyhedron” (see Gould and Lewontin, 1979). This image had been forgotten by 20th cen­tury biologists, but many of Galton's contemporaries discussed the model and its implications. Mivart (1871) invoked the polyhedron as a centerpiece of the critique that most attracted Darwin's attention and response (see Mivart, 1871, pp. 97, 113, and 228); W. K. Brooks (1883, p. 296) cited this image in the most important American treatise on variation, a book that strongly in­fluenced Brooks's visiting student, William Bateson. Bateson (1894, p. 42) then described “the metaphor which Galton has used so well — and which may prove hereafter to be more than a metaphor.” Kellogg (1907), speaking of Galton's “familiar analogy” (p. 332), considered the polyhedron as an ideal illustration for the key non-Darwinian challenge of heterogenesis (salta­tional evolution). And de Vries (1909, p. 53) stated that Galton's polyhedron expressed his own view of variation “in a very beautiful way.”

Galton introduced the metaphor of the polyhedron in his eugenic mani­festo and most influential book, Hereditary Genius (1869). In discussing “stability of types” in the closing chapter on “general considerations,” Galton presented his model in an overtly material, and petrological, form:

The mechanical conception would be that of a rough stone, having, in consequence of its roughness, a vast number of natural facets, on any one of which it might rest in “stable” equilibrium. That is to say, when pushed it would somewhat yield, when pushed much harder it would again yield, but in a less degree; in either case, on the pressure being withdrawn, it would fall back into its first position. But, if by a powerful effort the stone is compelled to overpass the limits of the facet on which it has hitherto found rest, it will tumble over into a new position of sta­bility, whence just the same proceedings must be gone through as before, before it can be dislodged and rolled another step onwards. The various positions of stable equilibrium may be looked upon as so many typical attitudes of the stone, the type being more durable as the limits of its sta­bility are wider. We also see clearly that there is no violation of the law of continuity in the movements of the stone, though it can only repose in certain widely separated places (1884 edition, p. 369).



Twenty years later, in Natural Inheritance (1889), the metaphor moved from an afterthought in the back of the book to the focal argument of an early chapter on “organic stability” (pp. 18-34). Galton now granted the im­age an abstract and formal geometry — as a polyhedron (based on a model that he actually built). He also supplied an illustration (reproduced as Fig. 5-1).

It is a polygonal slab that can be made to stand on any one of its edges when set upon a level table ... The model and the organic structure have the cardinal fact in common, that if either is disturbed without trans­gressing the range of its stability, it will tend to re-establish itself, but if the range is overpassed it will topple over into a new position . . . Though a long established race habitually breeds true to its kind, subject to small unstable deviations, yet every now and then the offspring of these deviations do not tend to revert, but possess some small stability of their own. They therefore have the character of sub-types, always, how­ever, with a reserved tendency under strained conditions, to revert to the earlier type. The model further illustrates the fact that sometimes a sport may occur of such marked peculiarity and stability as to rank as a new type, capable of becoming the origin of a new race with very little assis­tance on the part of natural selection...

When the slab rests ... on the edge AB ... it stands in its most stable position ... So long as it is merely tilted it will fall back on being left alone, and its position when merely tilted corresponds to a simple devia­tion. But when it is pushed with sufficient force, it will tumble on to the next edge, BC, into a new position of stability. It will rest there, but less securely than in its first position; moreover its range of stability will no longer be disposed symmetrically. A comparatively slight push from the front will suffice to make it tumble back, a comparatively heavy push from behind is needed to make it tumble forward. ... If, however, the slab is at length brought to rest on the edge CD . . . the next onward push, which may be very slight, will suffice to topple it over into an entirely

new system of stability; in other words, a “sport” comes suddenly into existence.



In Galton's own conception, the polyhedron embodies four major impli­cations that assert and codify the power of formalist constraint as an evo­lutionary agent of change (not just an impediment), while controverting the essential Darwinian claim that natural selection alone builds new forms in a creative and accumulative fashion.

1. Occasional large variations (sports) are more important for evolution than omnipresent, normally distributed small variation. This substitution of big for small forces a major compromise, and may even represent a fatal weakness, in Darwin's theory of natural selection.

Galton first introduced his polyhedron to question Darwin's key claim for insensible gradation in evolutionary continuity. (Galton, of course, did not deny continuity, but he wished to substitute a series of jumps — facet flipping, if you will — for Darwin's smoothness): “It is shown by Mr. Darwin, in his great theory of 'The Origin of Species,' that all forms of organic life are in some sense convertible into one another, for all have, according to his views, sprung from common ancestry.... Yet the changes are not by insensible gra­dations; there are many, but not an infinite number of intermediate links; how is the law of continuity to be satisfied by a series of changes in jerks?” (1884 edition, p. 369).

In a later article on “Discontinuity in evolution,” Galton posed the fundamental question of change in Darwin's favored style: “By what steps did A change into B? Was it necessarily through the accumulation of a long suc­cession of alterations, individually so small as to be almost imperceptible, though large and conspicuous in the aggregate, or could there ever have been abrupt changes?” (1894, p. 363). Acknowledging the criterion of relative fre­quency for resolving debates in natural history, Galton correctly notes that Darwin did catalog exceptions, but only to log their peripheral character and to assert the domination of gradualistic accretion by natural selection leading to adaptation:

Notwithstanding a multitude of striking cases of the above description collected by Darwin, the most marked impression left on the mind by the sum of all his investigations was the paramount effect of the accumu­lation of a succession of petty differences through the influence of natu­ral selection. This is certainly the prevalent idea among his successors at the present day, with the corollary that the Evolution of races and species has always been an enormously protracted process. I have my­self written many times during the last few years in an opposite sense to this.



Galton then strongly asserts that most evolutionary novelty, in opposition to Darwin, probably arises per saltum: “Many, if not most breeds, have had their origin in sports” (p. 365). Galton bases his rationale on the argument that continuous, small-scale Darwinian variability, though omnipresent, cannot be effective because regression toward the mean precludes accumula­tion in favored directions. Galton introduces the term “transilience” (literally “going between,” and recently revived by Templeton, 1982, for a different mechanism in the same spirit) to describe his favored concept of non-Darwin­ian saltatory variation, or facet flipping:

No variation can establish itself unless it be of the character of a sport, that is, by a leap from one position of organic stability to another, or as we may phrase it, through “transilient” variation. If there be no such leap the variation is, so to speak, a mere blend or divergence from the parent form, towards which the offspring in the next generation will tend to regress; it may therefore be called a “divergent” variation.... I am unable to conceive the possibility of evolutionary progress except by transiliences, for, if they were merely divergences, each subsequent generation would tend to regress backwards towards the typical center (p. 368).



2. Internal factors establish a hierarchy of stabilities, discontinuous in ori­gin, and explaining differing degrees of divergence among typical forms.

The nonhomogeneity of morphospace seems so “obviously” intrinsic to nature (lions close to tigers, with a big jump separating all cats from dogs and wolves) that we rarely consider the puzzles thereby raised. Once evolution itself becomes paradigmatic, simple inheritance and descent become the ob­vious, first-level reason for ordering the resemblances portrayed in our taxonomic hierarchies. But simple descent does not solve all problems of “clump­ing” in phenotypic space; we still want to know why certain forms “attract” such big clumps of diversity, and why such large empty spaces exist in con­ceivable, and not obviously malfunctional, regions of potential morphospace. The functionalist and adaptationist perspective (see Dobzhansky, 1958, quoted herein on p. 527, for a particularly striking metaphor of this view) ties this clumping to available environments, and to shaping by natural selec­tion. Structuralists and formalists wonder if some clumping might not record broader principles, at least partly separate from a simple history of descent with adaptation — principles of genetics, of development, or of physical laws transcending biological organization.

Galton proposed his polyhedron to explain a hierarchy of stabilities as in­ternally generated, not externally shaped by gradual natural selection. As the long quotation (p. 345) and figure indicate, Galton purposely shaped his model to encompass both small islands of stability within species (“subtypes” in his terms, and easily subject to reversion by tipping back to the primary type — as in facet BC of Fig. 5-1, which easily falls back to AB, but can move onward to a new type only by a much bigger push), and also to cover the ori­gin of new taxa that cannot revert (the push from facet CD to any position across the long axis and its major facet AB). Of course, Galton's polyhedron does include a role for external forces like natural selection: something must push, or the polyhedron can't move at all. But selection, in this model, pro­vides only an impetus: both discontinuity and directionality of change follow internal rules (completely for discontinuity, and partly for directionality by establishing channels — trajectories between facets — that must translate the impetus into actual change).

In an interesting discussion, Galton distinguishes internally enjoined posi­tions of stability from clumping by simple descent, and he rejects the Darwin­ian argument that taxonomic structure records differential shaping by natu­ral selection: “In the first place each race has a solidarity due to common ancestors and frequent interbreeding. Secondly, some may think it, though not by myself, to have been pruned into permanent shape by the long-continued action of natural selection. But, in addition to these, I have for some years past maintained that a third cause exists more potent than the other two, and sufficient by itself to mold a race, namely that of definite posi­tions of organic stability” (1894, p. 364).

Obviously struggling with a difficult concept that eludes precise formula­tion, Galton seizes upon a variety of metaphors from “governments, crowds, landscapes, and even from cookery and . . . from mechanical inventions” (1889, p. 22) to argue that workable solutions may be viewed as isolated and stable islands in a sea of largely empty space (impossible combinations). These “nucleating points” mark physically possible places, predetermined by the structure of matter and space, not a posteriori results of natural selection working as a contingent force in local environments. (Today, of course, we would formulate this idea in Darwinian terms as “multiple adaptive peaks,” but Galton struggles with an alternate view, worthy of our respect as an inter­esting option, of discontinuous solutions, internally set. In Galton's mecha­nism, natural selection would still operate — but only in the negative role of policing, and the facilitating task of providing a push into a preset channel.) Only a few forms of government can lead to internal stability; only some landscapes cohere; only a few combinations make flavorful dishes, despite a wide range of ingredients. In a memorable defense of formalist preference for the timelessness of distinct and stable configurations, and for downplaying the role of historical specificity, Galton writes of crowds and public rituals: “Every variety of crowd has its own characteristic features. At a national pag­eant, an evening party, a race-course, a marriage, or a funeral, the groupings in each case recur so habitually that it sometimes appears to me as if time had no existence, and that the ceremony in which I am taking part is identical with others at which I had been present one year, ten years, twenty years, or any other time ago” (1889, p. 23). Misidentifying (as King Solomon) the Preacher of Ecclesiastes, Galton regrets the sameness that such structural ahistoricity imposes. But he cannot disparage the way of the world: “It is the triteness of these experiences that makes the most varied life monotonous af­ter a time, and many old men as well as Solomon have frequent occasion to lament that there is nothing new under the sun” (1889, p. 24).

Morphotypes represent islands of stability, rare combinations of coherence among available parts (for history only becomes relevant by providing an inventory of availability). Natural selection may preserve these morphotypes once they form by facet flipping, but their origin must be regarded as discontinuous and internally mediated. The public carriages of London take discrete forms as omnibuses, hansoms, and four-wheelers. All these forms can be im­proved, but the boundaries of the types seem inviolable, for “the old familiar patterns cannot, as it thus far appears, be changed with advantage, taking the circumstances of London as they are.” (Galton, obviously, did not anticipate the macromutation of the internal combustion engine!) The three “islands” arose as discontinuous inventions and cannot be transformed one into the other, for intermediary steps would be structurally inviable: “A useful blend between a four-wheeler and a hansom would be impossible; it would have to run on three wheels and the half-way position for the driver would be upon its roof” (1889, p. 31). (In the old hansom, or two-wheeled cab, the driver sat on an elevated platform behind the passenger cabin, and reins to the horses ran over the roof. Drivers of four-wheeled cabs sat in front.)

3. The positions of stability, for both subtypes (discontinuities within spe­cies) and types, are not honed by natural selection, but internally preset as rare configurations of coherence among parts. The causal basis of stable form must therefore be explained by internal integrity, not by adaptation.

In his first formulation (1869, 1884 edition, p. 370), Galton proposed an internal, correlational basis for morphological stability: “It is easy to form a general idea of the conditions of stable equilibrium in the organic world where one element is so correlated with another that there must be an enor­mous number of unstable combinations for each that is capable of maintain­ing itself unchanged, generation after generation.”

As his most enduring practical legacy, Galton (1892) pioneered the use of fingerprints in identification and criminology. He also found in these “papil­lary ridges” an ideal example of discontinuous stable “islands” (subtypes in this case) that could not be attributed to direct natural selection. Galton ex­tols the value of these patterns as stable and traceable throughout ontogeny: “We know nothing by observation about the persistence of any internal char­acter, because it is not feasible to dissect a man in his boyhood, and a second or third time in his after life, whereas finger prints can be taken as often as de­sired” (1894, p. 366).

Fingerprints serve as ideal examples of internally generated structural is­lands for “they fall into three definite and widely different classes . . . tran­sitional forms between them being rare and the typical forms being frequent, while the frequency of deviations from the several typical centers . . . corre­spond approximately with the normal law of frequency” (1894, pp. 366-367). Individual patterns remain stable throughout life “and are conse­quently not unimportant in spite of their minute character” (p. 366).

Nonetheless, the stabilization of these three typical forms cannot be attrib­uted to natural selection:

Notwithstanding the early appearance of the patterns in fetal life and their apparent importance, they are totally independent of any quality upon which either natural selection or marriage selection can be con­ceived to depend. For example, I find the same general run of patterns in English, Welsh, Jews, Basques, Hindoos, Negroes, and men of culture, farm laborers, criminals, and idiots. I have failed to observe the slightest cor­relation between the patterns and any single personal quality whether physical or mental. They are therefore to be looked upon as purely local peculiarities, with a slight tendency towards transmission of inheritance (p. 366).



Galton concludes his treatment of this case with a formalist flourish: “I there­fore insisted that the continual appearance of these well-marked and very dis­tinct patterns proved the reality of the alleged positions of organic stability, and that the latter were competent to mold races without any help whatever from the process of selection, whether natural or sexual.”

4. Galton's polyhedron also highlights the theme of internally based directionality, not only of discontinuous change.

Galton often stated that his model did not deny continuity in change (1869, 1884 edition, p. 369), but only confuted the insensible character of transitions — for the polyhedron tumbles in a jerky fashion by facet flipping, and does not roll smoothly towards “better” positions. Galton's conception of change does grant a role to natural selection; some force has to push the polyhedron.

But a status as provider of an impetus scarcely fulfills Darwinian requirements for selection's power. In a metaphor for illustrating pure Darwinism, organisms may be represented as billiard balls, with natural selection as the pool cue. A perfectly round ball denotes Darwinian isotropic variation; the organism only supplies raw material, and cannot set its own direction of change. The ball's trajectory depends upon the pool cue of natural selection and the form of the surface (local environment). (The surface of this old table may be channeled and pitted, representing directions favored by external en­vironments.) The pool cue supplies propulsion, and the ball rolls with no in­ternal control over its own direction of motion.

But Galton's polyhedron pushes back. Absent an impetus, the polyhedron cannot tumble at all, but the pusher (the “pool cue” in Galton's model) doesn't set the direction of motion (or at least can only push effectively in a strictly limited number of trajectories set by the configuration of facets on the morphologically complex “billiard ball”). The direction of tumbling will therefore be determined as much by the internal structure of the polyhedron as by the coordinates and strength of the impetus. Only certain, internally es­tablished channels of change can be realized, even if natural selection must al­ways initiate the tumbling of the polyhedron — a very different image from setting the smooth billiard ball in motion! In this sense, Galton's polyhedron weds the theme of directionality with the idea of discontinuity.

Galton emphasizes this dual concern in his initial presentation. Just after describing the first version of his polyhedron (the stone with many facets), he introduces another metaphor to reinforce the theme of directionality com­bined with facet flipping — an image that may not be so apt or fruitful as the polyhedron itself, however expressive of Galton's intent:

Now for another metaphor, taken from a more complex system of forces. We have all known what it is to be jammed in the midst of a great crowd, struggling and pushing and swerving to and fro, in its endeavor to make a way through some narrow passage. There is a dead lock; each member of the crowd is pushing, the mass is agitated, but there is no progress ... At length, by some accidental unison of effort, the dead lock yields, a forward movement is made, the elements of the crowd fall into slightly varied combinations, but in a few seconds there is another dead lock, which is relieved, after a while, through just the same process as be­fore. Each of these formations of the crowd, in which they have found themselves in a dead lock, is a position of stable equilibrium and repre­sents a typical attitude (1869, 1884 edition, pp. 369-370).



Formalism, as the preceding chapter documents, boasts a long and distinguished pedigree, well antedating both Darwin and any explicit discussion of evolution. Darwinism rendered many formalist concerns irrelevant, but key features of the structuralist agenda could not be encompassed, or even well addressed, by natural selection and its functionalist mechanics. Galton's polyhedron provides a strikingly apt metaphor for the two great themes of formalism that continue to demand attention within evolutionary theory, and that the Darwinism of his day could not adequately comprehend — discontin­uous evolution, and internally generated pathways: in other words, saltation and channels. Both themes express the more general conception that internal properties of organisms “push back” against external selection, thereby ren­dering evolution, as dialectic of inside and outside — that organism, in other words, must be conceived as polyhedrons, not billiard balls.

I shall show, in the rest of this chapter, that formalist, or structuralist, evolutionary thought, from the immediate post-Darwinian years to the codifica­tion of the Modern Synthesis, continued to emphasize the twinned concepts of saltation and channels — for these notions represent two sides of the same conviction that internal structure can set and constrain the pathways of change. The modern plea to put history and organic integrity back into evolu­tionary theory echoes the same call. If “constraint” has become a buzzword of contemporary evolutionary theory, then I must assume that the shades of Galton and Geoffroy are smiling, for the structure of their thought has with­stood the formalist's ultimate test of timelessness.





Orthogenesis as a Theory of Channels and One-Way Streets: The Marginalization of Darwinism





MISCONCEPTIONS AND RELATIVE FREQUENCIES





The German zoologist Wilhelm Haacke devised the word “orthogenesis” in 1893 (see Kellogg, 1907; Bowler, 1983); but the concept implicitly moti­vated the entire formalist tradition that sandwiched Darwin (in a chronologi­cal sense) between Goethe and Geoffroy on one side, and searchers for the mechanical rules of embryological development on the other. The word liter­ally means “straight (line) generation,” but the term never bore a merely de­scriptive meaning, and all evolutionists understood the wider import. Ortho­genesis denotes the claim that evolution proceeds along defined and restricted pathways because internal factors limit and bias variation into specified chan­nels. In this key sense, orthogenesis must be regarded as a formalist theory, standing against the central Darwinian principle that natural selection im­parts direction by shaping isotropic variation (and doesn't only act in a nega­tive and subsidiary way to eliminate the unfit while some other process cre­ates the fit). (Evolutionists recognized, of course, that natural selection could also produce a directional anagenesis — first called “orthoselection” by Ludwig Plate — and that claims for orthogenesis must therefore demonstrate a causal basis for internal channeling beyond the power of natural selection to shape, and not only record the simple pattern of monotonic change itself).

Later on, after the Modern Synthesis congealed, and a latter day Darwin­ian consensus needed to recruit some whipping boys from the past, ortho­genesis became a convenient foil for illustrating the bad old days of failure to grasp selection's power. Ever since, most textbook one-liners have dismissed orthogenesis as a theistic remnant operating as a mild pollutant within sci­ence, an almost mystical theory of arcane and inexorable direction. I shall present the arguments of three prominent supporters — G. H. T. Eimer, A. Hyatt, and C. O. Whitman — to explicate orthogenesis as a viable and well-wrought formalist alternative (or supplement) to Darwinism at a time when natural selection could muster no compelling defense. But in hopes of encour­aging a more sympathetic hearing, I begin with three points raised to allay our conventional misconceptions in a more general way.

1. Some prominent non-Darwinians may justly be designated as “theistic evolutionists” — St. George Mivart and Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, for exam­ple. But orthogenesis does not fall into this category. Rather, and entirely to the contrary, all leading orthogeneticists insisted vociferously that their argu­ments for internal directionality included no teleological or theistic compo­nent. Most leading orthogeneticists held strictly mechanistic views in the mainstream of the highly deterministic late 19th century scientific consensus. They argued that internal channels arose as products of conventional, physi­cal causes, based upon properties of hereditary and developmental systems. (These properties may have been unknown, hence “mysterious” in the ver­nacular sense, but certainly not spiritual or teleological.) In stating claims for predictability of phyletic directions, and for parallelism of numerous inde­pendent lineages constrained by the same internal mechanics, most ortho­geneticists considered themselves in better tune with the physical and deter­ministic spirit of the age, whereas Darwinians fell into disharmony by committing themselves to undirected variation and unpredictable contin­gency of change. Moreover, the orthogeneticists argued, how could a charge of theistic progressionism be leveled when orthogenetic channels drove lin­eages to extinction as often as to complexity?

2. If the concept of internally constrained channels only represented a vague theoretical notion invented to oppose Darwin's principle of undirected variation, then the usual charge of vacuousness might apply. But all leading orthogeneticists, as my three case studies will demonstrate, identified a pri­mary channel fully consistent with a late 19th century biological consensus. Haeckel's biogenetic law had become widely accepted as the preeminent prin­ciple for tracing phylogeny (Gould, 1977b). This law of recapitulation re­quired that new evolutionary features be added to the ends of previous onto­genies, and that early stages of development be continually speeded up (law of acceleration) to provide room for these additions; adult stages of ancestors therefore migrated “backwards” in ontogeny to become juvenile features of descendants. This principle validated a primary ontogenetic channel as the major determinant of highly constrained evolutionary variability. Features consistent with established ontogenetic trajectories — as additions (by hypermorphosis) or regressions (by secondary slowing of developmental rate) — might easily arise as new evolutionary variants. Other configurations, even if potentially useful to organisms, might never arise in such a constrained sys­tem. In short, ontogeny itself served as the primary channel of constrained variation in orthogenetic theory.

3. The “hard version” of orthogenesis (held by some proponents, including Hyatt in my case studies) of inexorable one-way streets leading straight to extinction by degeneration of form compels little attention today (and enjoyed little support even in its own time). But the “softer” version of two-way chan­nels — furrows of constrained variation that provided biased material to natu­ral selection, but could not drive a trend to extinction all by itself and against Darwinian forces — expresses a primary and enduring theme of a formalist and structuralist biology that should still engage our close attention.

To explicate orthogenesis, I turn once again to Vernon Kellogg (1907), au­thor of the finest book on varieties of evolutionary theories and their distinc­tions (in a time of maximum disaffection with Darwinism and general agnos­ticism about alternatives). As discussed on pages 163–169, my framework for this book owes much to Kellogg's argument that Darwinism should be de­fined by a meaningful essence of minimal commitments — and that other no­tions can therefore be classified as basically helpful (“auxiliary” in his termi­nology) or contrary (“alternative”).

Kellogg identified three major “alternatives” to natural selection — one as functionalist as Darwinism, but offering a different explanation of adapta­tion (Lamarckism), and the other two as structuralist denials that adaptation must guide the origin of new species (orthogenesis, and heterogenesis or saltationism in de Vries's macromutational style). But Kellogg showed partic­ular sensitivity to the nuances, shadings and subtleties that arguments about relative frequency always impart to natural history. He clearly stated that the logic of all three alternatives stands squarely against natural selection if we argue for prevailing strength of effect and relative frequency: “All of these theories offer distinctly substitutional methods of species forming” (1907, p. 262).

However, Kellogg also recognized that “milder” versions might be seen as auxiliary — not consonant to be sure (for the nonselectionist logic cannot be contravened) — but supplementary rather than substitutional. Thus, for example, if acquired characters are inherited only rarely and weakly, then Lamarckism might aid natural selection in developing adaptation more quickly (by secondary reinforcement from a different source) — a position ad­vocated by Darwin himself throughout the Origin (1859, pp. 134-139, for example). But if acquired characters are inherited faithfully all the time, then natural selection will be overwhelmed and Lamarckism becomes a refutation of Darwinism. Relative frequency determines the distinction. Kellogg writes, in a statement just before the quotation of the last paragraph (1907, p. 262): “Few biologists would hold any of these theories to be exclusively alternative with natural selection; de Vries himself would restrict natural selection but lit­tle in its large and effective control or determination of the general course of descent.”

A similar situation prevails for orthogenesis. In Hyatt's “hard” (and truly antiselectionist) version, the internal pathway dominates all lineages, liter­ally pushing the impotent force of natural selection aside, and forcing lin­eages to extinction by phyletic senility. Natural selection exists as a “true” force, but can only operate as a peripheral factor that can, at most, delay the inevitable. In milder versions, the relative frequencies equalize (and the orthogenetic pathways need not lead so clearly to inadaptive forms). In soft versions, still defendable today (though we have ceased, for good reasons, to use the term “orthogenesis”), such internal drives become auxiliaries to selec­tion in providing an initial boost of directed variation for the “incipient stages” of useful structures that posed so many problems for early Darwin­ians (see Mivart, 1871) — and then letting the ultimately more powerful force of natural selection prevail in the larger realm of evident utility. Kellogg writes of such potentially “friendly” versions for Darwinism:

In true orthogenesis the variation, and hence the lines of modification, are predetermined. It seems obvious, however, to any believer in natural selection that sooner or later the fate of these lines of development will come into the hands of selection. And most orthogeneticists do indeed admit this. But it is precisely in the making of a start in modification that orthogenesis fills a long-felt want, and if capable of proof, should be gladly received by Darwinians as an important auxiliary theory in the explanation of modification, species-forming, and descent [my italics, and an interesting choice of words since Kellogg classifies orthogenesis as an alternative but recognizes here that a sufficiently mild version would fall into his other category of auxiliaries to Darwinism] (1907, p. 276).



None of the three versions discussed below presents quite so mild a view (though C. O. Whitman approaches such a formulation). All three conceive orthogenesis as a competitor to Darwinism and a more powerful force than natural selection. But these versions do illustrate a spectrum from the “cen­trist” Eimer (the primary popularizer of the name and idea), who viewed natural selection as deprived of power but not contravened; to the “hard liner” Hyatt on one side, who interpreted the orthogenetic drive as contrary to se­lection; to the conciliatory Whitman on the other, who hoped to find appro­priate and mutually reinforcing status for all viable contenders in a pluralistic evolutionary theory.

I present orthogenesis as a spectrum grounded in relative strength and frequency because I believe that a potential role for modern versions of such structuralist theories should be judged in the same manner. A mild formal­ism of constraint, akin to some ideas within the unfairly reviled theory of orthogenesis, may now enrich our Darwinian world (see Chapters 10 and 11) — and the potential fusion, in its richest form, would not be designated as strict selectionism with a little bit added, but would be recognized as a poten­tially integrated theory of a new kind (with a persistent Darwinian core). In this light, an understanding of the original formulations of orthogenesis and their varying relationships with Darwinism may enlighten us in our current struggle to integrate structuralist and functionalist approaches to evolution­ary causality.





THEODOR E1MER AND THE OHNMACHT OF SELECTION





Theodor Eimer's evolving views followed a channel every bit as directional (though inadaptive by current, and perhaps transient, standards) as the con­straining orthogenetic pathways that he ascribed to organisms. His empirical work of the 1870's, on coloration of lizards from Capri, presented a predomi­nantly functionalist argument, with a boost from internal channels to foster movement through incipient stages, and to reinforce the process along the way. In the first of his two volumes on orthogenesis — published in German in 1888 and translated into English in 1890 as “Organic evolution as the result of the inheritance of acquired characters according to the laws of organic growth” — Eimer stressed internal channels, relegated Darwin to a periphery, but still sought a genuine fusion (as the title proclaims) of formalist and func­tionalist perspectives. The second and last volume (for Eimer died soon there­after) — published in 1897 as Orthogenesis der Schmetterlinge: ein Beweis bestimmt gerichteter Entwickelung und Ohnmacht der Naturlichen Zuchtwahl bei der Artbildung — presents an anti-selectionist polemic (directed more at his sparring partner Weismann than at Darwin) and a defense of internal direction as preeminent. Its title proclaims Eimer's change of emphasis from fusion to exclusivity: Orthogenesis of butterflies: a proof of definitely directed development and the weakness of natural selection in the origin of species.

Gustav Heinrich Theodor Eimer (1843-1898) was born near Zurich and eventually became professor of zoology at Tubingen, Germany. He imbibed the late 19th century mechanistic tradition that so permeated German science (in such movements as Entwicklungsmechanik) — an attitude strongly op­posed to speculative phylogenizing, the main thrust of the “Darwinian” (read Haeckelian) tradition in Germany (see Gould, 1977b, chapter 6). But Eimer also expressed sympathy for “our great philosopher Oken” (1890, p. 433), the early 19th century formalist oracle of Naturphilosophie, who had pro­ceeded him at Tubingen, and had taught Agassiz, among others. Thus, Eimer doubted Darwinian functionalism from both sides of 19th century German biology — the romanticism of early 19th century formalist morphology, and the mechanism of late 19th century experimentalism.

All sources agree that Eimer's treatise (1890 translation) became the major English language source for the theory of orthogenesis. Contemporaries ei­ther set their own discussion in its light (see Whitman, 1919 — a posthumous publication of work done before 1910), or recommended its primary study to those unfamiliar with, or hostile to, orthogenesis (Kellogg, 1907, p. 322). Modern historians of sciences (Bowler, 1979, 1983) continue to view Eimer as “the major popularizer” of orthogenesis (Bowler, 1983, p. 141, in his book on non-Darwinian evolutionists of the late 19th century). I shall therefore treat Eimer's views first.

Eimer's mechanist side led him to reject any vitalist or “teleological” tinge to orthogenesis. “I repudiate any special internal force of evolution. Accord­ing to my view, everything in evolution is due to perfectly natural processes, to material, physical causes” (1890, p. 64). In fact, Eimer's philosophical de­fense of orthogenesis relies largely on its putative superiority over Darwinism as an evolutionary mechanics in the determinist tradition; for a discovery of law like order and direction in the key domain that Darwin had surrendered to chance — the origin of variation — would represent a notable triumph for a physicalist worldview. Eimer's opening words (1890, p. 1) set his entire argu­ment in this context: “It seemed to me long ago of the greatest importance to undertake an investigation of the question whether the modification (varia­tion) of the species of animals is not governed by definite laws.” Eimer, of course, concluded in the affirmative (1890, p. 1): “If the principles of Dar­winism are true because they can be shown to follow from natural laws, then it was to be expected that obedience to laws would also be discovered in that province which Darwin had surrendered to chance. But if variation were shown to follow certain laws, the same demonstration would apply to the or­igins of species.”

If the directions of variation are strongly channeled and law like, then evolutionary history may one day achieve the predictability of physical science (in its late 19th century deterministic version): “The evolution — the growth — of species one from another proceeds onwards as though following a plan drawn out beforehand” (1890, p. 29). This leaning towards predictability flows from the particular theory of channeling adopted by all leading orthogeneticists — phyletic cooptation of the ontogenetic pathway. By virtually synonymizing “evolution” and “growth” in the statement cited above, Eimer expressed the common Haeckelian belief that if ontogeny and phylogeny can­not be exactly equated, both processes proceed under a common nexus of causes (“phylogeny is the mechanical cause of ontogeny,” to cite a familiar Haeckelian maxim — see Gould, 1977b).

Since the predictable character of ontogeny cannot be denied, this compari­son establishes a prima facie case for orthogenetically channeled evolutionary change. Eimer (1890, p. 379) emphasizes the distinction without a difference: “We have to distinguish from one another (a) individual (personal) growth, (b) the growth of the race (the species), or phyletic growth. The latter is, how­ever, merely the sum of the modifications due to growth which the individuals of a line of descent have undergone in course of time.” Then, in a stronger statement of unity, he adds:

The individual growth of every plant, every animal is a brief and rapid repetition, under the continued influence of similar stimulation, of the series of effects produced by external stimuli in the course of vast periods of time on the tissues of its ancestors. The character of the individual growth of every living being therefore depends essentially on phyletic growth; the individual growth includes phyletic growth in itself. Since the individual growth of every living being is thus a stage of phyletic growth, since the latter . . . presents a sum of individual growths, both are traced back to one and the same process — fundamentally they can­not be separated (pp. 381-382).



Eimer used the ontogenetic channel as a device to elucidate a range of evolutionary phenomena beyond simple directionality of change. Why, for example, do some populations of a species “move on” to more advanced stages of phylogeny (and to formal status as a new species), while others languish in stability? Some contemporaries had argued that populations must first become isolated and then may diverge as selection dictates (while paren­tal forms remain stable in their unchanged environment). But Eimer denied allopatry as a precondition for speciation: some groups within a species sim­ply show more phyletic “activity” in varying beyond the ancestral onto­genetic trajectory. As these groups advance in form, they proceed further than their stable neighbors, eventually to a distance beyond the range of interbreedability with parental forms. Eimer thus argued that orthogenesis could explain both directional change and diversification.* Speciation marks the fractioning of a phylogenetic sequence into separate segments representing persistent and altered populations. “Varieties and species are therefore in re­ality nothing but groups of forms standing at different stages of evolution, that is, at different stages of phyletic growth, whether it be that they outstripped their fellows or their fellows them in the process of evolution, so that connection by intermediate forms was lost.... The essential cause of the separation of species is seen to be the persistence of a number of individuals of a definite lower grade of this evolution, while the rest advance farther in modification” (pp. 30-31).

Partly as a rhetorical device to be sure, but largely from deep convic­tion about the essence (and attractiveness) of his system, Eimer presented his style of orthogenesis as a reasonable and happy intermediate, an Aristotelian golden mean, between the two extreme views of purely internal and exclu­sively external forces as causes of evolutionary change. At one counterpro­ductive extreme of strict internalism, his colleague Nageli acknowledged ex­ternal forces of environmental shaping and adaptation only as hindrances to the expansive and progressive character of inherently driven evolution. Nageli granted but two roles to externality: the accountant's job of crafting clearer taxonomic groups by eliminating intermediates; and the grim reaper's task of pruning a bush that would otherwise have grown even more luxuri­ant. All evolutionary advance and diversification arises from intrinsic proper­ties of life, particularly from a Vervollkommungskraft, or perfecting force.

Nageli expressed this most internalist of all post-Darwinian evolutionary theories with a striking metaphor of gardeners and growing bushes — an iconography well worth remembering as a guide to this style of theorizing (note the obviously intended comparison of Darwinians with children):

Still better may we compare the vegetable kingdom to a great tree branching from its base upwards, of which the ends of the twigs repre­sent the plant forms living at one time. This tree has an enormous power of sprouting, and it would, if it could develop without hindrance, form an inextricable bush-like confusion of innumerable branchings. Exter­mination in the struggle for existence, like a gardener, prunes the tree continually, takes twigs and branches away, and produces an orderly ar­rangement with clearly distinguishable parts. Children who see the gar­dener daily at his task may well suppose that he is the cause of the for­mation of the branches and twigs. Yet the tree, without the constant pruning of the gardener, would have been much greater, not in height, but in extent, and in the richness and complexity of its branching. In the perfecting process (progression) and adaptation lie the mechanical im­pulses, which lead to the abundance of forms; in competition and exter­mination, or in Darwinism proper, only the mechanical cause of the formation of gaps in the two organic kingdoms (quoted in Eimer, 1890, p. 19).



Incidentally, and to show the power of mechanistic thinking in scientific cul­ture at the time, Nageli (though usually cited as a leading vitalist today) insisted as vociferously as Eimer that his orthogenetic forces, though unre­solved, must be entirely natural consequences of the physiochemical con­struction of organisms.

At the other extreme of overextended externalism, strict Darwinians hold that organisms contribute only isotropic raw material (hence no direction from internal forces), and that natural selection produces all evolutionary change as adaptation. Eimer did not engage Darwin himself as a chief op­ponent — for Darwin had held more pluralistic views and was, moreover, no longer available for polemical battle. Instead, Eimer focused his anti-selectionist arguments against August Weismann, chief disciple of the exclusivistic version that adopted the label of “neo-Darwinism” (see Romanes, 1900, on the difference, non-continuity, and “non-homology” of this “brand” of Neo-Darwinism — Weismann and Wallace's hyperadaptationism — with the same term as adopted by the Modern Synthesis of the 1940's, and continuing today). Weismann, as discussed extensively in Chapter 3, strongly advocated the Allmacht (“all-power,” or omnipotence) of natural se­lection. In a rhetorical dig, Eimer countered with the Ohnmacht (“without-power,” or weakness) of Darwin's primary force.*

Eimer attempted to land squarely in the middle of this debate (1890, p. 63): “Neither Nageli's view, which ascribes the principle of utility an almost infinitesimal effect, nor Weismann's which regards adaptation as all powerful, can be unreservedly accepted. The truth lies between them.” Eimer joins in­side and outside with a model of internal orthogenesis as the architect of pos­sible pathways for change (with ontogenetic trajectories as the most impor­tant channels) and environmental forces as potentiators of the channels into actual expression as evolutionary alteration. As a simple, but instructive ex­ample, channels feature two directions. Orthogenesis builds the channel — thus constraining change to two paths in a potential infinity — but doesn't specify the direction. Environment supplies the required push, thus assuring that the prefigured change will be either adaptive or at least neutral, for selec­tion operates as an efficient executioner of the ill designed. (Or, taking an even larger role, environment might choose the channel, if several stand open for possible entry.)

Morphological “degeneration” provides the best example of environmen­tal impetus within Eimer's concept of balance between internal and external forces. The ontogenetic channel supplies the internal component, since sim­plification can be achieved most easily by backing down the ontogenetic pathway. But environment must provide the downward push — for change usually proceeds in the other (and upward) direction, as the biogenetic law asserts. Environment, in this case, might act in a positive sense (when sim­plification leads to local adaptation, as in parasitism), or in a more negative way (when unfavorable climates prevent the full passage of ontogeny, and a resulting juvenilization then becomes inherited in Lamarckian fashion). Eimer writes: “The abundance of the species which have been formed by de­generation, by retrogression, is known to every zoologist. It is self-evident that their origin is to be traced to the action of external conditions” (1890, p. 53).

Eimer found his best example of balance, or environmentally triggered orthogenesis, in a favorite case of all early evolutionists — the Mexican axolotl, or sexually mature tadpole of the genus Ambystoma. (Axolotl formerly bore the separate generic name Siredon, while the parental form often re­ceived a misplaced “1” as Amblystoma — as in the quote below.) Ontogeny set the orthogenetic channel and change could only proceed in the prefigured di­rection, up or down. But the actual path taken depends upon the environ­ment — down for warm and permanent ponds, up in more terrestrial climates:

Siredon is for the problem of evolution one of the most important living animals, in that it brings so beautifully before our eyes the transition of lower sexually mature into a higher sexually mature form, and at the same time shows so clearly the causes of the transformation. We discern these causes simply in the reaction of the organism under external condi­tions, the increased exertion of an organ already in process of formation (the lung), and the disappearance of another (gills) in consequence of definite demands of the environment, and changes connected with these by correlation. Amblystoma appears where the axolotl has too little wa­ter to live in, where it is compelled to live on dry land. That this is the case is proved by the possibility of artificially rearing Amblystoma from the axolotl by gradually withdrawing water (1890, p. 46).



At this point, Darwinian forces might have played a major role in Eimer's system. He needed external potentiators to trigger prefigured orthogenetic pathways. Had he chosen selection as a preferred external force, his resulting amalgam would still have departed from a Darwinian rubric — for the idea of internal orthogenetic channels runs so contrary to the key Darwinian postu­late of undirected variation. But selection would still have played an impor­tant role as an instigator of trends.

However, Eimer chose Lamarckism as the preferred external potentiator for his “brand” of functionalism. He opted for use and disuse with inheri­tance of acquired characters as the standard mode for transferring environ­mental information to organisms — and thus as the primary mechanism for adaptive change. Selection, to Eimer, therefore became a negative force — an eliminator of the unfit, once other factors had channeled a trend.

Eimer's 1890 subtitle neatly expressed his balanced view of external and internal forces — “. . . the result of the inheritance of acquired characters according to the laws of organic growth.” The laws of organic growth act as internal (structural) channels of orthogenesis; the catch phrase of the Lamarckian system then identifies the primary external pusher. Natural selec­tion therefore becomes marginalized to the periphery of half a theory.

Eimer's low opinion of selection represents a common viewpoint among evolutionists of his generation, as expressed in the most familiar of all late 19th century critiques (see pp. 137–141) — the denial of “creativity” to natu­ral selection (viewed entirely as a negative force, while new and favorable fea­tures must arise by some other “creative” process). Eimer places himself squarely in this majoritarian tradition when he writes (1890, pp. 383-384): “Natural selection can, as I have repeatedly remarked, create nothing new. It only so far contributes to the growth of the organic world that it selects the forms which are most fitted for life, and preserves them for the future action of new stimuli and of crossing . . . Thus the power of selection lies chiefly in the promotion and diversification of organic growth. It is ... only an indirect cause of the evolution of living beings.”

Eimer's original contribution lay in his characterization and defense of the creative force that could displace selection to such an insignificant periphery. Eimer understood the crucial role of undirected variability in the logic of Darwinian argument. He knew that his orthogenetic channels would derail the Darwinian system by vesting creativity for change in the process of variation itself; selection could then only speed up or hinder what internally generated directionality had previously supplied. Eimer contrasts orthogenesis against selectionism, while also reemphasizing the mechanistic, and non-vitalistic, character of channeled variation:

This conclusion is in a certain sense opposed to Darwin's, since it recognizes a perfectly definite direction in the evolution and continuous modification of organisms, which even down to the smallest detail is prescribed by the material composition (constitution) of the body. According to this conclusion, the real Darwinian principle, that of selection de­pending on utility, is only effective within the limits which are prescribed by the material composition of the body, that is, by the fixed directions of evolution. Accordingly there is nothing fortuitous, but everything in evolution to the smallest detail is governed by laws (1890, p. 431).



If the creative force of evolution resides in the process of directed variation itself, then the nature of internal channeling assumes crucial importance. In the absence of a documented mechanistic theory for the nature of inheritance, Eimer and all leading orthogeneticists followed the empirical tradition of in­ducing supposed regularities of channeled variation from common features of case studies. Eimer presented his list, with varying numbers and orderings of categories, in all his major publications (1890, pp. 28-30; 1897, pp. 18-21). Each principal “law” of channeled variation identifies a putative ontogenetic pathway, and therefore indicates the status of individual growth as the pri­mary determinant of evolutionary direction. Eimer includes in his list:

1. As an overarching principle, the biogenetic law of recapitulation, which specifies that the sequence of terminally added features in phylogeny shall, through acceleration of development, become the ontogenetic channel of fu­ture changes. But what regularities specify the character of these terminal additions?

2. The invariant series of changes in color markings from longitudinal stripes, to spots, to transverse stripes, and finally (in most cases, when inten­sification occurs) to darker and more uniform coloring. Today, we may be surprised and puzzled (as, by the way, were many scientists at the time, for example Whitman, 1919) by Eimer's decision to present so apparently partic­ular and contingent a sequence as not only effectively universal, but also as the major specific rule of channeling stressed in all his publications. Eimer first enunciated this principle in his early work on lizards. The doctrine then became the foundation for his most important study on coloration of but­terfly wings (the focus of the final volume (1897) of his treatise on ortho­genesis and evolutionary theory). Eimer's specific claims for butterflies did not gain a wide following, as many naturalists recognized the circular charac­ter of his argument. (He assumed the law of longitudinal striping ® spots ® transverse striping a priori and then used this principle to establish “phyletic” sequences of living species with no other criterion of cladistic order).

3. “The law of wave-like evolution, or law of undulation” (1890, p. 29). New characters appear at particular parts of the body — almost always the posterior end — and then pass forward during growth. A series of progressive waves may sweep over the body during a single ontogeny. This law, appar­ently so arbitrary and riddled with exceptions, also met with little favor, even among fellow orthogeneticists. Whitman (1919), for example, accepted the notion of spatial “waves” in ontogeny as channels of variation, but argued that progressive color variation passed from front to back in pigeons, in di­rect opposition to Eimer's pathway. (A “rational” basis for spatial waves could be sought in the biogenetic law, as older parts of the body should act as the source for new phyletic features added terminally. But the posterior end of an animal may be either old or young depending on the body's mode of growth.)

4. “The law of male preponderance.” In Eimer's words (1890, p. 28): “that where new characters appear, the males, and indeed the vigorous old males, acquire them first, that the females on the contrary remain always at a more juvenile lower stage, and that the males transmit these new characters to the species.” This principle could claim a rationale beyond simple sexism (though this social context should not be disregarded as a source either), for male preponderance followed from the general theme behind all Eimer's channels — the biogenetic law. If, as most biologists believed in Eimer's time, males tend to move beyond terminal female stages in a common ontogenetic channel, then new features will first appear in males, since novelty must be added terminally under Haeckel's law.

The specification of such channels as constraints on adaptation does not, of itself, push natural selection to a periphery of unimportance; for, as Darwin argued in another context (see pp. 251–260), existing channels must have evolved for some adaptive reason in ancestors — and if selection constructs adaptation, then Darwinian forces can reclaim their creative power, whatever limits these inherited channels may place upon current adaptation. In fact, Eimer did toy with the idea that selection might have built the primary channels — doing so in a burst of fanciful speculation, much in the mode that he himself would later castigate as the primary weakness of adaptationist thinking.

For the primary law of longitudinal stripes to spots to transverse stripes in coloration, for example, Eimer suggested that the initial state might represent an adaptation of ancestors (under the false assumption that monocots pre­cede dicots in the geological record of angiosperms): “The fact of the original prevalence of longitudinal striping might be connected with the original pre­dominance of the monocotyledonous plants, whose linear organs and linear shadows would have corresponded with the linear stripes of the animals” (1890, p. 57). Eimer then extended this speculation by guessing that conver­sion to spots “might be connected with the development of a vegetation which cast spotted shadows”; and the final transition to transverse stripes “with the shadows, for example, of the branches of woody plants — thus the marking of the wild cat escapes notice among the branches of trees” (p. 57).

From this phyletic fancy, Eimer moved to more conventional Darwin­ian reasons for other channels. Male preponderance “might possibly be ex­plained by the fact that the males fight the battle of existence more than the females, and therefore must always be first to respond to new demands” (p. 58). And ornamental waves moving from posterior to anterior might also gain a selectionist basis “by the fact that the part of the body farthest from the head is most in need of mimicry, because it is least protected in other ways by the sense organs, and because it is at a special disadvantage; that it is the last part to be withdrawn from the pursuit of an enemy” (p. 58).

But Eimer could not, ultimately, grant even this much power to selection and adaptation for two major reasons. First, he decided that several of his channels expressed no evident utility and, even if adaptive in final expression, could not have possessed any selective value in incipient states (1890, p. 59):

But all this does not explain the first occurrence of the new characters, nor the undeviating course of the evolution in a particular direction. For when a number of varying individuals are compared it is seen that the variations of all tend to a definite end, and that the majority of the inter­mediate forms show stages in the development of the characters, which are absolutely without use to them. This cannot be explained except by natural growth, whose operations are changed, intensified, or dimin­ished to a certain extent by the stress of adaptation, and may also at times be entirely restrained.



(Linguistic choices can be highly illuminating. Note how Eimer refers to adaptation as a “stress” rather than a determining cause — that is, a push from the outside that can, at most, speed up, slow down, or change in minor ways the primary pathway of internal direction.)

Second, although adaptationist guesses can be formulated for the observed channels, formalist alternatives also exist, and seem eminently more reason­able. The law of undulation from back to front, for example, only reflects the metameric growth of many animals. The back segments form last, and late stages, under the biogenetic law, develop progressive characters (1890, pp. 60, 69).

In sum, orthogenesis derails Darwinian functionalism by denying the cru­cial requirement for undirected variability. “The variation of species takes place not in all kinds of directions irregularly, but always in definite direc­tions, and indeed in each species in a given time in only a few directions” (1890, p. 20). Ultimately, Eimer rejected Darwinism for the most common of all 19th century reasons — the critique of “creativity” — for he clearly un­derstood the deathblow that such powerfully channeled and limited variation would deal to Darwinian hopes for awarding a dominant relative frequency to natural selection in creating evolutionary change: “Natural selection be­comes weak [ohnmdchtig] thereby. It cannot be depicted as an active major cause [Hauptmittel] in the transformation of forms; at most, it can be an aux­iliary cause [Nebenmittel] of such transformation, as it can only perfect what orthogenesis ordains” (1897, pp. 14-15).

The metaphors and images chosen by scientists to illustrate their complex views often provide our best insight into their relative weighting of interact­ing forces and foci. Eimer developed what he and others considered a “lib­eral” or a “compromise” version of orthogenesis, where internal forces of di­rected variation do not determine the entire shape and rate of phylogeny (as in Hyatt's more extreme views), but rather work in balance with environmen­tal determinants — a model of external triggers and choosers for a strictly lim­ited number of internally set pathways. This balanced view, as noted above, might have awarded important space to Darwinian functionalism as an exter­nal force — except for Eimer's particular commitment to Lamarckian causes as primary determinants of the external component, with selection acting only as an auxiliary force, largely confined to the negative role of eliminating the unfit.

Eimer summarized these weightings in a metaphor that compared evolu­tion with the migration of a population. The direction of movement repre­sents the orthogenetic pathway, the dominant cause of the entire process. Ex­ternal forces of environment act primarily in finetuning this predetermined direction. Adaptation may play an important role, but the Lamarckian inher­itance of acquired characters trumps Darwinian factors in this realm of functional influence. Selection only sharpens the edge of success by eliminating the failures.

Thus we may compare the whole process of the modification of forms to the results of the migration of the people over an extensive foreign terri­tory. Some tribes, not having the strength to follow, soon, others later, remain behind; others again reach a distant goal. Some retain their char­acters in their new home or strengthen them, even modify them by corre­lation, others change under the influence of external conditions and adapt themselves to the environment — all that is not sufficiently capable of endurance is left lying by the way and perishes, and if the struggle for existence is at all severe only the toughest of all survive (1890, p. 55).





ALPHEUS HYATT: AN ORTHOGENETIC HARD LINE FROM

THE WORLD OF MOLLUSKS





Standard examples of orthogenesis all took the same form: paleontologically based, and therefore temporally extensive, monotonic trends towards clearly inadaptive features, leading inevitably to the extinction of the afflicted lineage. Supposed “best cases” included the enlarging antlers of the “Irish Elk” (but see Gould, 1974), the extended canines of saber-toothed cats, and the self-strangulation of the oyster Gryphaea, as overcoiling of one valve clamped the other shut, immuring the animal in its own shell (but see Gould, 1972).

These lurid stories, in their textbook versions, are the caricatures of a seri­ous non-Darwinian theory once quite popular among paleontologists from the late 19th century through the 1930's: the idea that trends, though adaptively initiated, might break from environmental control and run, inexorably along the same path, eventually to extinction — if the proximal cause that originally responded to the adaptive pressure became so entrenched that se­lection could no longer halt or reverse the trend. W. D. Lang (1923), for ex­ample, proposed that an originally adaptive increase in rates of shell secretion might become unreversible, leading to Gryphaea's deathly dilemma: “These trends, even if at first encouraged by the environment because they are of use to the organism, are soon out of the environment's control; they are lapses which may overtake Ostrea [the supposed ancestor of Gryphaea] at any mo­ment of its evolution — trends which having once started continue inevitably to the point when their exaggeration puts the organism so much out of har­mony with its environment as to cause its extinction.” A. E. Trueman, who had developed the empirical case for Gryphaea (1922), also asserted the anti-Darwinian character of internally driven trends: “Excessive development im­plies that the evolution was out of the control of the environment and it may be presumed that some internal factor was responsible” (1940, p. 93). True­man proposed no mystical or vitalist explanation (as the standard caricature maintains), but sought a cause consistent with modern genetics. (He suggested that such inadaptive orthogenesis might arise by mutation pressure too high for natural selection to overcome.)

An even stronger anti-Darwinian version of the theory — a maximal depar­ture from functionalist explanation — held that all stages of a trend might fol­low a prefigured, internally programmed path, and that environmental selec­tion need not be invoked at all, even for an initiating push. These versions usually anchored their argument in a more than metaphorical reading of phylogeny as akin to ontogeny and imbued with similar, inevitable stages of youth, maturity and old age.

To illustrate this hardest-line account of orthogenesis (and to set up a con­trast with the opposite and most accommodating version of C. O. Whitman, discussed in the next section), I turn to an influential monograph on Miocene snails (see, for example, the lengthy popular and well illustrated account in Le Conte, 1888, pp. 236-239), published in 1880 by the American paleontol­ogist Alpheus Hyatt. The case becomes particularly relevant for this historical chapter because Darwin and Hyatt had engaged in a long and frustrating cor­respondence, full of misunderstanding, about the theory of ontogenetically programmed phylogeny (see F. Darwin, 1903, pp. 338-348). Hyatt later sent Darwin a copy of his 1880 monograph, and Darwin replied, less than a year before his death, with an uncharacteristically ungracious acknowledgment (reprinted in F. Darwin, 1903, p. 393 — letter of May 8, 1881): “I am much obliged for your kind gift... which I shall be glad to read, as the case has al­ways seemed to me a very curious one. It is all the kinder in you to send me this book, as I am aware that you think that I have done nothing to advance the good cause of the Descent-theory.”

Hyatt, deeply stung, donned his hair shirt, and quickly penned a response on May 23: “I tell you that your strongest supporters can hardly give you greater esteem and honor. I have striven to get a just idea of your theory, but no doubt have failed to convey this in my publications as it ought to be done.” Francis Darwin, Charles' son and editor of this volume, then adds, af­ter quoting Hyatt: “We find other equally strong and genuine expressions of respect in Prof. Hyatt's letters.” But, genuine respect notwithstanding — and I don't doubt Hyatt's bonae fides for a moment — no version of orthogenesis could be more contrary to Darwinism than the theory of internally pro­grammed phylogeny.

From a parochial American standpoint at least, the evolutionary theories devised and promoted by paleontologists E. D. Cope and Alpheus Hyatt oc­cupy an important historical position. For a nation still coming of age as a scientific power, and still bearing a reputation, at least in natural history, as supplier of data to the theory-mills of a more sophisticated Europe, the rise of an American movement, centered in a novel theoretical perspective, and gain­ing both attention and respect in Europe, marked an important gain in matu­rity. Cope and Hyatt led this co-called “American school,” often identified as “Neo-Lamarckism.”

Cope and Hyatt did accept the inheritance of acquired characters, but a new view on the mechanism of recapitulation, and a distinctive argument about ontogeny in general, built the truly central and characteristic argument of their theory (see Gould, 1977b, Chapter 4). These two scientists proposed a new mechanics for the biogenetic law, and this “principle of acceleration” forms the core of their theory and the basis of its orthogenetic implications. Ontogeny will recapitulate phylogeny provided that two necessary principles can be validated. All supporters of the biogenetic law promoted some version of these principles. First, new characters must arise in phylogeny as additions to the end of previous ontogenies. This principle of “terminal addition” (Gould, 1977b) would, of itself, engender recapitulation, as descendants pass through the adult stages of ancestors before accreting their own novelties in ontogeny — except for a logical problem that required the second principle for a full and coherent theory. The phylogeny of a lineage unfolds through thousands of steps in geological immensity; new stages cannot be added indefinitely to the unaltered ends of previous ontogenies, lest growth to adult­hood take untold years to reach completion. Some process — some law of he­redity — must produce a general speeding-up of development, so that ances­tral ontogenies can unfold more rapidly, leaving time at the end for addition of novel features.

All recapitulationists necessarily defended some form of speeding up for ancestral ontogenies through phyletic time. Haeckel himself, who thought a great deal about genealogies but precious little about mechanisms, advocated a differential dropping out of stages, with compression of the remaining steps to a shortened ancestral ontogeny (Gould, 1977b). Cope and Hyatt, who both devised a theory of recapitulation in 1866 (independently of each other and of Haeckel), first proposed an ultimately more popular and plausible ver­sion of ontogenetic quickening — the “principle of acceleration,” or general increase in rate of development (with no necessary excision of stages). This law of acceleration (as a foundation for recapitulation) became the most im­portant theoretical contribution of the American school (Fig. 5-2).

The law of acceleration held that ancestral ontogenies unroll more and more rapidly in successive descendants, thus making room for new stages in phylogeny. (The gill slits of a human embryo can therefore represent the com­pressed and accelerated adult form of our piscine ancestry.) With ontogeny thus depicted as a quickening treadmill through time, attention could shift to the nature of stages that accumulated in successive terminal additions — for the accreted stages form a series that defines the lineage's phylogeny. If the se­quence of accreted stages represents the unfolding of an internal “program,” then phylogeny can be justly called orthogenetic — for the law of acceleration makes room on the treadmill, and the next stage of a predictable sequence then struts its hour upon the adult stage.

Later versions of “Neo-Lamarckism” in this American style cannot be called orthogenetic because they did not propose an internally programmed series of new stages. These later accounts embody a view of causality every bit as functionalist as Darwin's, though relying upon Lamarckian mecha­nisms rather than natural selection. New features arise adaptively as organ­isms actively respond to needs imposed by altered environments. The se­quence of novel stages accretes as a contingent series, mapping the functional requirements of a changing external world.



5-2. Mechanisms proposed by recapitulationists to compress late stages of an ancestral ontogeny into earlier stages of the embryology of descendants. In Cope and Hyatt's solution, shown bottom left at B, stages are compressed by acceleration. In Haeckel's solution, bottom right at C, some stages are simply omitted by deletion. From Gould, 1977b.





But earlier versions of Cope's views (and Hyatt's opinion throughout his life) posit an evolutionary mechanism diametrically opposed to this later functionalism — an internal dynamic yielding an orthogenetic phylogeny of predetermined stages, with the source of predictable novelty inherent in on­togeny itself. This history of lineages unfolds along a “grand potential ontog­eny” much longer than the realized portion of early species in a phyletic se­ries. The adult stage of the initiating species does not reach beyond an early phase of the potential sequence. (Suppose, for example, that the full series in­cludes 100 stages, ending in predictable extinction. The ancestral species may only progress from stages 1 to 10 in its own ontogeny, leaving 90 available steps for successive terminal additions in the phylogeny of subsequent spe­cies.) This concept of an extended potential ontogeny as the source of predict­able phyletic additions became the most powerful version within a class of non-Darwinian theories generally regarded today as purely fanciful or falsely analogic, and without conceivable mechanism — the idea of racial ontogenies and life cycles. But the concept of a genealogical ontogeny, however indefen­sible by modern standards, once possessed an interesting rationale in this re­capitulatory context.*

In Cope's early view, lineages arose with a latent phyletic life cycle extend­ing far beyond an initially realized ontogeny. So long as acceleration prevailed in phylogeny, old ontogenies unfolded more rapidly and new stages of the grand potential ontogeny accreted at the end. A much less common form of regressive evolution could foster a slowing down of ontogeny (“retardation” in Cope's terminology) and retention of previously juvenile stages as adult forms of descendants (the older “degenerative” interpretation of a phenome­non now generally viewed more positively as “neoteny”). Since acceleration occurs far more commonly than retardation in evolution (as progress gener­ally prevails over regress), the general vector of genealogy proceeds as an un­rolling of phyletic life cycles. The stages of phylogeny are, in any case, inter­nally programmed and predictable. Cope wrote in 1869 (quoted in Cope, 1887, p. 123): “Genera have been produced by a system of retardation or ac­celeration in the development of individuals: the former on pre-established, the latter on preconceived lines of direction.”* Cope recognized the formalist implication of this view, as expressed in the key postulate that the origin of a structure precedes its use — in opposition to the cardinal principle of any func­tionalist theory (including both Darwinism and Lamarckism) that functional needs impel adaptive change. (Cope's subsequent shift to a functionalist posi­tion prompted the development of his later Neo-Lamarckism.) Cope wrote in 1870 (quoted in Cope, 1887, pp. 145-146): “We look upon progress as the result of the expenditure of some force forearranged for that end. It may be­come, then, a question whether in characters of high grade the habit or use is not rather the result of the acquisition of the structure than the structure the result of the encouragement it offered to its assumed beginnings by its use.”

Hyatt differed from Cope in an essential manner that made his theory the most uncompromisingly recapitulatory of all 19th century views, the most committed of all proposed evolutionary mechanics to “programmed” racial life cycles, and the most orthogenetic. Cope had provided the obvious inter­pretation for a standard 19th century perception that, whereas most lineages progressed by complexification, others regressed to greater simplicity. Cope argued that progressive lineages undergo acceleration and therefore “gain room” to add new stages to the end of old ontogenies; regressive lineages, on the other hand, experience ontogenetic retardation and never surpass the ju­venile stages of their ancestry. Hyatt, in a paradox resolved by an ingenious argument, tried to render both progressive and regressive evolution as results of acceleration alone. For Hyatt, the law of acceleration reigned virtually without exception; no more extensive or uncompromising version of univer­sal recapitulation has ever been offered.

Hyatt resolved the apparent paradox with an argument that he affection­ately called his “old age theory.” The programmed steps of a potential phylogeny proceed through a sequence more than merely analogous to the phases of ontogeny. Adult stages of early species in a lineage exhibit traits of phyletic youth; adults in a lineage's geological midlife display the features of phyletic maturity; while adults of species near the extinction of a lineage finally de­velop unmistakable signs of phyletic senility. Hyatt's hardest-line, internally programmed version of orthogenesis rests upon this notion of a phyletic life cycle. The stages of a phylogeny become as predictable and predetermined as the phases of an ontogenetic sequence. Environment must be sufficiently favorable to permit the unfolding (just as a fetus will not grow without adequate nutrition), but the sequence of stages is internally ordained, not functionally entrained by interaction with a surrounding environment. Hyatt wrote (1897, pp. 91-92): “There is a rise of the individual through progres­sive stages of development to the adult and a decline through old age to ex­tinction. In the evolution of the stock to which the individual belongs there is a similar law, a rise through progressive stages of evolution to an acme and a decline through retrogressive stages to extinction . . . The type, like the indi­vidual, has only a limited store of vitality, and both must progress and retrogress, complete a cycle and finally die out, in obedience to the same law.”

In this scheme, even the simplified ontogenies of regressive evolution can arise by acceleration (see Fig. 5-3). The adult stages of phyletic old age resem­ble, by analogy to the “second childhood” of our own senility, the simple fea­tures of youth (although these recurring traits signify decline and extinction, rather than exuberance, as they now appear in an exhausted stock). By this time, acceleration has become so intense that most middle stages in ontogeny begin to drop out entirely. The earliest embryonic stages, however, remain stubbornly persistent. As acceleration intensifies, newly introduced senile fea­tures push back the older progressive traits of phyletic midlife, until these middle stages encounter the persistent juvenile features. Pushed at one end by senile features, and pressed against the impenetrable wall of persistent embry­onic traits at the other end, these progressive middle stages finally tumble off the phyletic conveyor belt. Characters of phyletic old age now merge with ju­venile features (see Fig. 5-3). Ontogeny becomes shorter (by excision of inter­mediate stages), and simpler (because the remaining juvenile and old-age stages resemble each other in external appearance). In this way, the simplified ontogeny of regressive lineages does not represent retardation or truncation of development, but rather acceleration so intense that all intermediate complexity (once intercalated between true youth and “second childhood”) disappears by compression. Hyatt writes (1889, p. x): “Acceleration pro­duces first, the earlier development of some of the progressive characteristics





5-3. Hyatt combined his concept of a predetermined phyletic life cycle with his principle of universal acceleration to explain how even the simplified ontogenies of regressive evolution can originate by acceleration. In Hyatt's “old age theory” (his designation) as extinction nears; senile stages of phyletic youth and maturity become the adult stages of a waning stock in racial senescence. Ontogeny be­comes so shortened by acceleration and deletion that senile stages merge with persistent juvenile stages to produce a greatly simplified and senile course of life. From Gould, 1977b.





combined with geratologous characteristics; secondly, the earlier develop­ment of geratologous characteristics and their fusion with larval characteris­tics, which occasions the complete replacement of progressive characters, and occurs only in the extreme forms of retrogressive series.”

Hyatt applied his old-age theory with abandon to all spheres of life and culture. I find no usage more curious than his invocation of phylogerontism to argue against voting for women (1897b). Hyatt claims that “in the early history of mankind the women and men led lives more nearly alike and were consequently more alike physically and mentally, than they have become sub­sequently in the history of highly civilized peoples. This divergence of the sexes is a marked characteristic of progression among highly civilized races.” Ontogenetic old age tends to blur sexual differences as men become less hir­sute and develops larger breasts, while sexual activity declines equally (or so Hyatt claimed) in both sexes. Since phyletic sequences mirror ontogeny (and since the human race has become dangerously phylogerontic already), we must beware any culturally enhanced blurring of distinctions between the sexes — for androgyny of any form (physical, cultural or conceptual) denotes racial senescence. Giving the vote to women will enhance this dangerous ten­dency towards equalization of roles:

Such changes [women's suffrage] . . . might lead to what we might now consider as intellectual advance, [but] this would not in any way alter the facts that women would be tending to become virified and men to be­come effeminized, and both would have, therefore, entered upon the ret­rogressive period of their evolution . . . The danger to women cannot be exaggerated, nor too carefully considered, in view of the fact that ad­vanced women have adopted the standard of men, and have not tried as yet to originate feminine ideals to guide them in their new careers and thus maintain the divergence of the sexes (1897, p. 91).



This notion of an internal program for phylogeny (including the time bomb of inherent racial senescence and extinction) ran so contrary to Darwin's con­victions about functionalism and contingency that he couldn't grasp Hyatt's conception at all (more, I think, through disbelief at the content, than inabil­ity to comprehend the argument). In 1872, as Darwin grappled with views of the American school in preparing the 6th and last edition of the Origin, he engaged Hyatt in a long correspondence about acceleration and racial life cy­cles (in F. Darwin, 1903, pp. 338-348). Darwin expressed his perplexity in the first letter: “I confess that I have never been able to grasp fully what you [that is, Cope and Hyatt] wish to show, and I presume that this must be ow­ing to some dulness on my part” (in F. Darwin, 1903, p. 339).

After several exchanges of letters and diagrams (with some gain in clarification), Darwin remained puzzled by the most anti-selectionist and non-functionalist theme in Hyatt's system: the explanation of simplified ontogenies in phyletic old age by intensified acceleration, with senile adult features in­terpreted as nonadaptive preludes to extinction. Darwin conjectured in response: why not propose the far simpler interpretation that these shortened ontogenies and “degraded” adult forms represent adaptations to conditions of life that also characterized early stages of the lineage. This stark contrast and mutual incomprehension illustrate, in a striking manner, the difference between Hyatt's formalist orthogenesis as an ultimate drive to phyletic death, and Darwin's functionalism, with extinction as failure to adapt. Darwin wrote to Hyatt (in F. Darwin, 1903, pp. 343-344): “With respect to degrada­tion of species towards the close of a series, I have nothing to say, except that before I arrived at the end of your letter, it occurred to me that the earlier and simpler ammonites must have been well adapted to their conditions, and that when the species were verging towards extinction (owing probably to the presence of some more successful competitors) they would naturally become readapted to simpler conditions.”

Later in the same letter, Darwin pens the most famous line of this correspondence — a lovely contrast between the contingency of environmentally entrained adaptation and the predictability of “hardline” formalism as a the­ory of internal necessity: “After long reflection I cannot avoid the conviction that no innate tendency to progressive development exists” (in F. Darwin, 1903, volume 1, p. 344).

Through the density of theoretical discussion in these letters, another theme circulates. Hyatt expresses his plans to restudy one of the most famous paleontological series of presumed stratigraphic continuity in an isolated set­ting: the Miocene fresh-water planorbid pulmonates of the Steinheim lake in Germany (then interpreted as a volcanic caldera, but now recognized as a meteor crater — see Reif, 1976). The German paleontologist Hilgendorf had published an already classical account in 1866, including one of the first ge­nealogical diagrams to reflect Darwin's new world order. Hyatt proposed a restudy and Darwin opined: “I earnestly hope that you may visit Hilgendorf's famous deposit ... I most sincerely wish you success in your valuable and difficult researches” (in F. Darwin, 1903, p. 344). Hyatt proceeded, and even­tually provoked Darwin's last and bitter response to his orthogenetic ideas by sending Darwin a copy of his monograph (1880) on the Steinheim planorbids.

Hyatt's proposed phylogeny could hardly differ more from Hilgendorf's original interpretation (Fig. 5-4). Where Hilgendorf drew a conventional branching tree with a monophyletic root, Hyatt presented four lineages, sepa­rate at the base and evolving in strict parallel. Such a striking difference should, in our conventional view of scientific change, record Hyatt's im­proved observations at the site. Hyatt did make some empirical changes (al­though we would have to view his effort, in retrospect, as a continuity in steady state rather than an improvement over Hilgendorf, for he corrected some errors but introduced just as many others). But Hyatt's alterations pri­marily record the application of a different theory to the same data. Iconogra­phy often provides a powerful guide to conceptual frameworks because pic­tures frequently make explicit what our psyches fail to acknowledge in the verbal mode (Rudwick, 1992; Gould, 1989c, 1993d, 1996a). Hyatt's phylogeny of the Steinheim planorbids (Fig. 5-5) epitomizes hardline orthogenesis under the guidance of phyletic life cycles.

Hyatt depicts four lineages within the lakebeds, each beginning from an ancestral Planorbis levis stock (not shown). This putative phylogeny rests upon two principles derived from his orthogenetic “old age” theory (and showing that Hyatt's convictions directed his observations, rather than the conventionally touted vice versa).

1. Hyatt distinguished the four lineages on the basis of supposedly progres­sive and retrogressive characters. The rationale for these designations proba­bly owed more to vague and general cultural conventions (largely the folklore of more and less as better and worse) than to any explicitly biological argu­ment. Progressive characters include increase in size, shell thickness, strength of ornamentation, and change of shape from planispiral (flat like an am­monite) to trochiform (domed like a conventional snail). In other words, small, thin, smooth, and flat specifies a primitive state; whereas large, thick,

5-5. Hyatt's phylogeny for the Steinheim planorbids could not differ more from Hilgendorf's. Hyatt envisages several parallel lineages each in different stages of the same phyletic life cycle, with some lineages becoming stronger (as expressed in their larger and thicker shells) and others becoming evolutionarily senile in their thinner, smaller, and irregularly coiled shells. This interesting figure comes from a glass plate that Hyatt prepared for his 1880 monograph but did not pub­lish. The printed version is much cruder and less informative. I here publish Hyatt's original for the first time. (I now occupy his office and I found this plate in the drawer that still contains his Steinheim specimens.) The three rightmost lineages represent three sub lines of a single degenerating stock, hence giving four lineages in toto (as the text states).





bumpy and blocky equals advanced. By contrast, regressive characters in­clude decrease in size, loss of ornamentation, thinning of the shell and, above all, a tendency for irregular growth by uncoiling (loss of order as a sign of both ontogenetic and phyletic senility).

Hyatt identifies three of his four lineages as progressive, distinguishing them by different combinations of the key characters. The most purely pro­gressive steinheimensis-trochiformis lineage advances by all criteria to greater size, thickness, and quadrate shape with keels and carinae (rather than a smooth whorl profile) and, as the formal name states, a domed outline. Shells of the oxystomus-supremus lineage become larger and more ornamented; the spire does not increase in height, but the shell still grows taller because the under­side of the whorl profile becomes more inflated. The parvus-crescens lineage shows less advance, as the shell remains flat and smooth, but increase in size establishes the primarily progressive character.

Retrogressive tendencies appear in the three sublineages of the remaining branch, all derived from P. minutus. The turbinatus sublineage shows a mix­ture of progressive and retrogressive characters (Hyatt, 1880, p. 17, refers to this melding as “the battle of the tendencies”), with modest size increase and some strengthening of ornament offsetting a basic decline. The middle, or denudatus, sublineage is purely retrogressive, as shells become smaller, smoother and irregular in growth by increasingly erratic coiling. Finally, the distortus lineage also mixes phyletic strength and weakness. Ornament re­mains strong and size increases in portions of the lineage; but, as the name implies, coiling becomes irregular as the stock declines.

2. Although later convention (and emerging practice in his own time) would lead us to read Hyatt's chart as a stratigraphic sequence, his phylogeny employs an unconventional iconography. Vertical position does not represent time or stratigraphy, but rather stage in an orthogenetic sequence. Snails drawn at the same level did not necessarily live at the same time, but show common “attainment” in a phyletic series. Thus, for example, P. trochifortnis, the ultimate stage of the most progressive series, lived near the bottom of the stratigraphic sequence — implying that this lineage ran its full course with geological rapidity at the base of the section. Conversely, P. oxystomus, the initial form of the second progressive lineage, makes an initial appearance high in the sequence.

This unconventional iconography illustrates the power of theory to chan­nel perception — orthogenesis as an organizing principle, in this specific case. Consider the immense confidence that a scientist must be willing to invest in the validity of a chosen surrogate to substitute any other criterion for the emi­nently available (and obviously meaningful) stratigraphic order of time as the measuring rod for vertical position in phyletic charts. (Cladists have created quite a fuss in our day by using inferred branching order in preference to time of observed paleontological appearance, if they include fossils in their phylogenies at all — see Schaeffer, Hecht, and Eldredge, 1972. In the heyday of overweening confidence in recapitulation, several paleontologists reversed the conventional geological procedure and inferred stratigraphic order from presumed phyletic stage based on ontogenetic repetition of ancestral adult stages — see Smith, 1898, on ammonite phylogeny, for example. Thus, Hyatt's procedure, while interestingly unconventional, scarcely lacks precedent — or consequent.)

In sum, Hyatt presents a picture of multiple lineages, evolving in parallel but at different times (though in the same lake), through a preset sequence of stages — with some lineages displaying an upward march to progressive char­acters, and others a downward slide to regressive states of the same features. Hyatt justifies all these claims under his old-age theory of orthogenetic un­folding: phylogenies proceed inexorably from periods of phyletic youth and vigor, through maturity to racial senescence and extinction. Consider a series of questions, all resolved by the orthogenetic interpretation (and all refuting Darwinism, or any other functional account):

1. Why do the separate lineages go through similar stages? The causes cannot reside in functional entrainment by common environmental pressures (either by Darwinian selection or Lamarckian response to perceived needs) because the same stages occur at different times in various lineages (same re­sponse in different environments), while different lineages (progressive vs. re­gressive) often evolve disparate forms at the same time (different response in the same environment). Hyatt argues that the cause of parallelism must there­fore be sought in an internal shove, not an external (environmental) push:

While the perpetuation and survival of the differential characteristics can be thus accounted for [by natural selection], we must look to other causes for the production of the parallel forms and the regularity of suc­cession of these forms, as shown in the arrangement in the different se­ries, and in the development of the individual. This cause lies in some law of growth and heredity which reacts against the tendency of the physical environment to produce variations and differences, and pro­duces parallelism in the development of different individuals of the same species, of different species in the same series, and in the succession of forms in the different series, and also limits the tendency to variation within definite boundaries in the species (1880, p. 26).



2. Why does the invariant series of stages follow this characteristic se­quence, with either a march to progressive features in shell size, thickness, shape and coiling, or a fall to increasingly degenerate states of the same char­acters? Again, an answer cannot be provided by functional adaptation in ei­ther the Darwinian or Lamarckian mode, for extended regressive sequences, by their inadaptive nature, could not then occur. Instead, this sequence of up and down marks the full scope of the “grand potential ontogeny,” defining the orthogenetic phylogeny of the entire fauna: “Thus, we can readily under­stand that each of these series, whether progressive or retrogressive, can so far as its collective life is concerned, be compared in the closest manner with the life of an individual, and similar correspondence be traced in both, and also that the tendencies exhibited are of two kinds in each, one towards building up of the organization and the other directly opposed to this” (1880, pp. 17-18).

Hyatt also tries to provide direct evidence for the ontogenetic construction of phylogeny. He notes, for example, that ordinary adults of regressive lin­eages reach stages found only in the most degenerate individuals of progres­sive populations — those that have grown far past their normal adult form to a marked senility. The ruinous dotage of a progressive individual therefore corresponds with the ordinary adult form of a phylogerontic race (1880, p. 17).

3. Why, in the same lake and during the same general period, do some lineages progress while other closely related lines regress? Again, no functional or adaptationist answer can suffice, for the same times and environments should not engender opposite responses in such closely allied lineages. The solution must reside in internal orthogenesis. Lineages progress or regress ac­cording to their internal state — particularly, their status in the unrolling of the grand potential ontogeny. Progressive lineages, in their phyletic youth, can re­sist a harsh environment; but regressive sequences, in their phyletic dotage, must succumb. Hyatt's four lineages achieve their distinctions by occupying different positions in the grand potential ontogeny. His three progressive lin­eages evolve in the vigor of their phyletic youth or maturity; meanwhile, the regressive series decline in their phylogerontic senility.

Environment does not, as in functionalist theories, operate as an aid or entrainer, but rather as a clear detriment and degrading force. Lineages in their phyletic youth can prevail by innate virility against the incessant storm:

How shall we account for the progression of the progressive series? How then could this environment act upon such closely allied shells, in such an opposite way as to cause the decrease of some races and be entirely healthy for others? We habitually refer such questions among animals, and in man, to the innate strength or pliability of the constitution of the race or the individual, and account for the survival, growth, and devel­opment of races and individuals by this reference to their supposed abil­ity either to resist change in their surroundings, or to become modified in accordance therewith ... Precisely the same environment, therefore, may produce results diametrically opposed to each other, even upon different individuals of the same species or closely allied forms, provided there is anything in the constitution either directly acquired or inherited, which enables the organization of one to resist or fit itself to conditions which the other cannot healthfully endure (1880, p. 16).



But lineages in phyletic senility cannot prosper; their decreases in size de­note waning viability, and their irregularities of growth signify the last gasp of faltering strength. A wounded or senile individual in a progressive race may uncoil in injury or dotage, whereas the same fate awaits all ordinary adults in regressive stocks. “Retrogressive characteristics . . . could be compared with the pathological conditions, normal or abnormal, of occasional diseased and senile individuals of the progressive series. They [regressive features] are... inherited with ever increasing effect in successive species, occasioning distor­tions and retrograde metamorphoses, and finally leading to the extinction of the race” (1880, p. 14).

Early in his monograph, Hyatt advances the conventional claim of scien­tific methodology — that his phylogeny should be judged and accepted on the criterion of objectivity in research: “These series, having been the result of no preconceived plan of arrangement as far as the author could judge, were con­sidered to be approximately natural” (1880, p. 8). Yet Hyatt clearly falls vic­tim to his own admonition. He did not establish his four-lineage scheme by any principle of ordering specimens in a manner that could be called “objec­tive” or even bound by rules independent of his phyletic preferences. Hyatt's scheme of multiple parallel lineages represents a theoretical construction, dic­tated by his orthogenetic conviction about racial life cycles, not a proclama­tion of nature.

First of all, Hyatt could not separate his lineages with accuracy or con­fidence. He uses a method of “eyeballing” and, following the limits of his time, presents no statistical arguments. Such a failure to quantify need not de­rail a study in principle; we need no measuring rods to sort a mixed pile of sparrows and elephants into two groups. But the Steinheim planorbids interfinger and intergrade in the most complex manner, both spatially and temporally. The shells occupy a grand clump of morphospace, with sub-clumps here and there to be sure, but with no clear or persistent piles. No re­searcher since Hyatt has been able to specify four distinct lineages, each maintaining integrity through time.

Second and most important, Hyatt admitted that he could not use the stan­dard method for establishing lineages — temporal succession in the fossil re­cord. For he could not identify any clear stratigraphic sequences at all! Fol­lowing his words about natural series and lack of preconceptions, Hyatt wrote: “These series . . . were assumed to be a reliable basis for working hypotheses, in spite of the fact, that no certain data with regard to succession in time were obtainable” (1880, p. 8). How then can phyletic series be estab­lished?

Hyatt then admits that, in the absence of stratigraphy, phyletic sequences must be identified by the expectations of a biological principle — dare we label it a preconception? — namely, the biogenetic law itself.* Hyatt even permitted himself to construct phyletic sequences from specimens found on the same bedding plane if successive stages of a recapitulatory series could be identi­fied: “This assumption rests largely upon well known laws of heredity, such as these, that an animal found to repeat the stages of another animal of a closely allied species in the young, with the addition of new characteristics in the adult, may be considered to be either a lineal descendant of that species, or of some form common to both; that in such cases as these, whether the form or species occur mixed on the same level, or on different levels, there is but one natural arrangement” (1880, p. 8).

If recapitulation entered the argument as an a priori assumption, then so did the cognate notion (in Hyatt's mind at least) of racial life cycles. Hyatt as­sumed the very phenomenon he hoped to prove when he built his phyletic se­quences in the absence of stratigraphic resolution, often from specimens on the same bedding plane. He resolved all violations of stratigraphic order by dictates of the “old age” theory. For example, both Hyatt and Hilgendorf re­garded P. oxystomus as a derived branch of the main stock. But Hyatt inter­preted this species as the base of an extensive progressive series, built upon variation within a single bedding plane because he could establish no em­pirical continuity to still higher stratigraphic levels. Hyatt's preferred order helped his argument immensely — for the idea of parallel yet non-synchronous lineages strongly supported his claim for internal necessity, not environmen­tal entrainment, in the unfolding of phyletic stages. But he presented no evi­dence beyond the ordering power of the preconceived theory itself!

In a second example that engendered bitter debate with the followers of Hilgendorf, Hyatt claimed additional evidence for non-synchronous parallel­ism by finding the most advanced specimens of P. trochiformis (the acme of the main progressive lineage) in the lowest stratigraphic levels — leading to the assertion that this entire lineage unfolded with great rapidity (and providing more evidence for internal programming since other lineages would then be evolving much more slowly, and Hyatt could therefore identify differential phyletic vigor, rather than variation in environmental pressure, as the cause for disparities in evolutionary rate). But other researchers could only find P. trochiformis at high stratigraphic levels (Hyatt's lower specimens may have eroded from upper levels and washed down) — and therefore interpreted this lineage as evolving much more slowly.

If Hyatt maintained such overweening faith in the validity of his orthogenetic theory of ontogenetic programming, we can scarcely be surprised that he also read the supposed empirics of the Steinheim planorbids as a disproof of Darwinism — hence Darwin's negative response in receiving the mono­graph (see p. 372). Hyatt attempted to specify both the potential and the lim­its of natural selection for the Steinheim planorbids — and the restrictions overwhelmed the possibilities. Following the usual formalist critique of selec­tion's creativity, Hyatt allowed that selection might explain why four lin­eages, rather than fewer or many more, became established, and why they continued to propagate. The origin of four lineages in the Steinheim lake, Hyatt tells us:

... appears therefore to be perfectly well accounted for by Darwin's the­ory of natural selection. In no other way can we possibly account for the selection of but four out of the varieties of PL levis, and the continuous propagation and increasing intensity of the differences which they ex­hibit. An examination . . . will show anyone how many variations are lost in each form or species of the series, and how few are continued. This can only be accounted for upon the supposition that those which survived possessed in some way advantages indicated by their peculiar variations, which enable them to propagate those variations, and sup­press their less fortunate neighbours (1880, p. 26).



But how shall we explain the far more important issue of causes for actual directions of modification in the lineages — that is, the evolutionary changes themselves? Hyatt asks whether selection could be effective here: “Are these parallelisms adaptations, and can they possibly be attributed to the direct ac­tion of the uniform external environment upon the forms of the different se­ries?” (1880, p. 19). Hyatt denies any formative power to the Darwinian mechanism. Selection can do the negative work of weeding and separating, but cannot perform the positive action — the essence of evolution — of chang­ing and progressing.

Hyatt offers two major critiques of selection in the light of ontogenetically programmed orthogenesis. First, how can the functional premise of adapta­tion be supported when so much change occurs in the regressive mode fol­lowing phyletic maturity? “Nothing can exceed the confidence with which the strict Darwinist assumes, without any appeal to observation, that all characteristics which are inherited are necessarily advantageous. Exactly the reverse is very often true” (1880, p. 101). Second, he recognizes that Darwin's system entails a crucial assumption of isotropic, undirected variability. Since the conveyor belt of the grand potential ontogeny introduces new characters with a decided bias, creativity resides in the internal directionality of varia­tion. Natural selection can only work as a subsidiary force to the primary agent of directed variation. “Natural selection, in fact, is simply one of the transient conditions of the physical surroundings, having no value as a cause of origin of characteristics” (1880, p. 102). The ontogenetic conveyor belt feeds new characters and creates evolutionary novelty; selection can only eliminate, separate and impose a little cosmetic shaping upon the internally generated trend:

Thus it may be said that the struggle for existence, and the survival of the fittest, is a secondary law grafted upon laws of growth, and governed by them in all its manifestations. The law of natural selection, as generally understood, assumes in the first place the existence of an animal type, of its descendants, and of a tendency to variation (indefinite and unlimited) in every one and all of these descendants, from which (an indefinite and unlimited) selection may take place during the struggle for existence between competing forms, destroying the weak and permitting only the strongest and fittest of these variations to survive. The truth is, as far as my studies have gone, that there is no such thing as indefinite or unlim­ited variations in any species... This obvious proposition, if admitted, leads at once to the question, what are the limits within which a species may vary? ... The limits of variation in the species have been found to correspond to the growth changes in an individual (1880, p. 20).



Hyatt viewed his orthogenetic theory as a contribution to the larger vision of 19th century mechanistic science — a hope that when we finally learn the laws of heredity and discover the principles of biased variability, then evolu­tion shall become as predictable as ontogeny: “In all cases the individual and its series must change by growth along certain lines of modification, which it is but reasonable to suppose we shall someday be able to map out beforehand for a series of forms with the same precision that we can now forecast the metamorphoses of any individual in a given species” (1880, p. 18). Charles Darwin, who understood the contingent character of history, could not have disagreed more forcefully.

Hyatt's hardline version of orthogenesis offered no quarter for fruitful interaction with Darwinism. If all structuralist and formalist thinking, and all theories of channeled variation, existed only (and in principle) in this adversarial mode, then the important 19th century debate on orthogenesis could teach us little today. But my account of Eimer's orthogenetic theory has already illustrated the potential for useful interaction between internal ortho­genesis and external adaptation — even though Eimer chose Lamarck rather than Darwin for the basis of his functionalist component. I shall next present the even more accommodating version of C. O. Whitman, to illustrate a max­imal contrast with Hyatt, and to emphasize the possibility of Darwinian in­sight from orthogenesis.

Kurt Vonnegut introduced the useful word “karass” to describe groups of people who may not explicitly interact, or even know each other, but whose lives seem tied together by action and circumstance. Hyatt and Whitman (who did, in fact, know each other well) must have belonged to the same karass. Both studied under Louis Agassiz. (Hyatt spent his career in the Boston area, worked primarily on ammonites, and occupied the office that I now inhabit at the Museum of Comparative Zoology.) Both participated in the early days of summer courses in New England natural history and ma­rine biology (Whitman studied with Agassiz on Penikese Island; Hyatt ran a teacher's school of natural history in Annisquam). Both men rank as the two key figures in the early days of the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole, Hyatt as first president of the board of trustees, Whitman as first di­rector. Both devoted their major research efforts to formulating theories of orthogenesis, Hyatt with ammonites and snails, Whitman with pigeons. But their orthogenetic theories could not have differed more profoundly, particularly in their divergent attitudes toward complementarity with Darwinism. In understanding why the adversarial Hyatt reached a dead end, and in grasping the insight offered by the accommodating Whitman (who, for unfortunate historical reasons, gained very little historical impact for his orthogenetic views), we may better appreciate both the blind alleys and the vital themes of orthogenesis (and of formalism in general) in our struggle to develop a more adequate modern theory of evolution.





C. O. WHITMAN: AN ORTHOGENETIC DOVE IN DARWIN'S

WORLD OF PIGEONS





The old benediction — “may you live in interesting times” — has been regarded as either a blessing or a curse. Charles Otis Whitman certainly merited such an epithet, for his professional life spanned the greatest range of opposites through the grandest transition in ideas that biology has ever experienced. He began by studying with Louis Agassiz, last of the great and legitimate crea­tionists, and ended as the chief American promoter of mechanistic embryol­ogy in the German tradition. He made his primary reputation in “cell lin­eage” studies of the fates and products of the earliest blastomeres. But, unlike most experimentalists of the time, he also pursued other research as a gifted natural historian and evolutionary theorist. His major work in later years, while he served as professor at the University of Chicago, treated a subject that could not have been more canonical for Darwinian evolutionary biology in the naturalistic tradition — heredity, variation, and evolution in Darwin's own chosen organism, the domestic pigeon. Whitman, however, used Dar­win's pigeons to support orthogenesis, and to deny selection a primary or for­mative role in evolution.

C. O. Whitman died in 1910, of pneumonia contracted after working furi­ously on the first cold day of winter to provide shelter for his birds. (F. R. Lillie, once his assistant and later his successor at Woods Hole, eulogized his old boss: “In his zeal for his pigeons, he forgot himself.”) Whitman had never published an extensive defense of his orthogenetic theories. His diverse and voluminous writings were finally collated and published posthumously as a large three-volume monograph by the Carnegie Institute of Washington in 1919. The evolutionary debates of the early 20th century had been fierce, and finally won by the followers of Darwinian theory. I have often wondered how this history might have differed if this paramount biologist (Kellogg, 1907, p. 288, called Whitman “the Nestor of American zoologists”) had lived to publish what might have been the best empirical defense of orthogenesis. In any case, the posthumous and much delayed 1919 monograph was too dis­jointed, too incomplete and above all, too late, to win any potential influence.

Whitman accepted Kellogg's classification of evolutionary theories as auxiliary or alternative to Darwinism. He also agreed with Kellogg that three ma­jor alternatives fueled the great debate as the century turned: Lamarckism, orthogenesis, and macromutationism. Since Whitman rejected the inheritance of acquired characters with all Weismann's zeal, his own list of viable alterna­tives included only two theories. Since he also believed in the strict continuity of Darwinian gradualism, de Vries's mutationism held no appeal for him ei­ther (though he regarded the theory as a viable contender, while treating Lamarckism as a dead issue). These rejections left only orthogenesis as a potentially valid challenge to Darwinism. The first and most important vol­ume of Whitman's monograph bears the title: “Orthogenetic Evolution in Pigeons.”

Whitman provides our best example for disproving the false equation of orthogenesis with some form of theistic teleology — the main source for cur­rent derision, and for our failure to grasp the strengths and serious recom­mendations of this approach. The link to teleology can be dismissed as not only wrong, but entirely backwards. No case could be clearer than Whit­man's, for he spent a maximally distinguished career as one of the great mech­anists of American experimental embryology. He did not conceive orthogenetic trends as mystical impulses from outside, but as mechanistic drives from within, based upon admittedly unknown laws of genetics and embryol­ogy. Consider the last words of his 1919 monograph (p. 194):

If we are to draw the line sharply between science and all transcendental and telistic mysticism, we must regard the germ-organism as wholly mundane in origin and nature. If the germ is a thing of evolution from purely physical foundations — and any contrary assumption is a denial of the evolution principle, then we may say that it is a self-building within the limits of physical conditions, and just as truly autonomic in its form and behavior as is the crystal. In the formation of a crystal self-determi­nation is ever present, and so it must be in the case of the organism.



Orthogenesis therefore emerges as a favored a priori prediction of deterministic science. Whitman's opening words strike the same theme with a note of triumphal optimism:

Progress in science is better indicated by the viewpoints we attain than by massive accumulation of facts. Darwin's perspective made him a prodigy in the assimilation of facts and an easy victor in the greatest con­flict science has thus far had to meet. His triumph has won for us a com­mon height from which we see the whole world of living beings as well as all inorganic nature; phenomena of every order we now regard as ex­pressions of natural causes. The supernatural has no longer a standing in science; it has vanished like a dream, and the halls consecrated to its thraldom of the intellect are becoming radiant with a more cheerful faith (1919, p. 3).



Moreover, the particular character and personal history of Whitman's mechanistic outlook suggested the specific form of his orthogenetic argu­ment. His work on cell lineages had mapped the fate of the earliest blastomeres, and had indicated that the source of eventual organs could be specified even in minute and formless clumps of initial cells. If embryos grew so pre­dictably, why should evolutionary change be devoid of similar order? Ontog­eny, in other words, should serve both as a model and a source for evolu­tion — a joint vision of directional change from within. Whitman, in fact, argued that ontogeny and phylogeny represent the same essential process: “Development is the one word that seems to me to best circumscribe the more general problems of biology. It is also the one word that best empha­sizes the essential unity of ontogeny and phylogeny. These two terms have been used as if they stood for two distinct series of phenomena, when in real­ity they apply to one and the same series” (1919, p. 177). Phylogeny therefore becomes as determinate as growth itself: “Not only is the direction of the change hitherto discoverable, but its future course is predictable” (1919, p. 38).

In his most telling statement, and in response to de Vries's oft-repeated but invalid argument (see p. 445) that orthogenesis revitalizes teleology, Whit­man invokes the ontogenetic comparison to defend orthogenesis as the posi­tion most consistent with a mechanistic worldview:

I take exception here only to the implication that a definite variation ten­dency must be considered to be teleological because it is not “orderless.” I venture to assert that variation is sometimes orderly and at other times rather disorderly, and that the one is just as free from teleology as the other. In our aversion to the old teleology, so effectually banished from science by Darwin, we should not forget that the world is full of order, the organic no less than the inorganic. Indeed, what is the whole devel­opment of an organism if not strictly and marvelously orderly? Is not ev­ery stage, from the primordial germ onward, and the whole sequence of stages, rigidly orthogenetic? ... If a developmental process may run on throughout life, . . . what wonder if we find a whole species gravitating slowly in one or a few directions?... If a designer sets limits to variation in order to reach a definite end, the direction of events is teleological; but if organization and the laws of development exclude some lines of varia­tion and favor others, there is certainly nothing supernatural in this (1919, p. 11).



Darwin had begun the Origin of Species in a most honorable way that affirmed the necessary, and heretofore largely lacking, empirical foundation of evolutionary argument. Darwin's first chapter did not announce to the world his sweeping reform of all life and thought; instead, he wrote about pigeons (1859, p. 20): “Believing that it is always best to study some special group, I have, after deliberation, taken up domestic pigeons. I have kept every breed which I could purchase, or obtain, and have been most kindly favored with skins from several quarters of the world ... I have associated with several em­inent fanciers, and have been permitted to join two of the London pigeon clubs.”

Darwin used pigeons to advance the two primary and distinct arguments of his book: (1) the factual claim that evolution had occurred, and represented the source of organic relationships, and (2) the theoretical assertion that nat­ural selection operated as the primary cause of evolutionary change. He sup­ported the first contention by proving that the full range of extensive diversity in modern domesticated breeds had descended from a common wild source, the rock-pigeon Columba livia. (Darwin then added the crucial analogical ar­gument that such intraspecific change could, by extension, serve as a model for evolution at all scales and times). He buttressed natural selection by not­ing that breeders had produced this extensive range of results by propagating favored forms from a cornucopia of essentially isotropic and undirected vari­ation.

Whitman, of course, accepted the first contention, but refuted the second by challenging one of Darwin's smaller claims. Darwin had observed two ma­jor patterns of coloration within Columba livia — (1) “two-barred,” with two black bands on the front edges of the wings and uniform gray color elsewhere (Fig. 5-6); and (2) “checkered” (spelled “chequered” by both Darwin and Whitman), with black splotches on some or all wing feathers (Fig. 5-7), but also retaining the two bars (usually in more indistinct form). Darwin re­garded the two-barred state as ancestral, and the checkered pattern as de­rived. Whitman reversed this sequence, writing:

The wild rock pigeons, universally regarded as the ancestral stock of all our domestic pigeons, exhibit two very distinct color patterns, one con­sisting of black chequers uniformly distributed to the feathers of the wing and the back, the other consisting of two black wing bars on a slate-gray ground. The latter was regarded by Darwin as the typical wing

pattern for Columba livia; the former was supposed to be a variation arising there from, a frequent occurrence but of no importance. Just the contrary is true; the chequered pigeon represents the more ancient type, from which the two-barred type has been derived. ... The direction of evolution in pattern in the rock pigeons has been from a condition of rel­ative uniformity to one of regional differentiation (1919, p. 49).



Whitman's inversion of Darwin's sequence lay embedded within a theory of evolutionary change that Darwin would also have rejected. Whitman based his reversal on a more general concept of directional change in color­ation from an initial homogeneity (checkers on all wing feathers) towards re­gional differentiation (elimination of checkers over most of the wing, with strengthening and coalescence to bars at the distal edge. The bars form by en­largement and alignment of checkers on adjacent feathers; a bar, in other words, arises from a row of checkers that “flow together in a single band” — Whitman, 1919, p. 99).

Whitman then expanded his sequence of reduction plus regional differentiation beyond the patterns of domesticated pigeons to identify an ineluctable, orthogenetic tendency in the entire family Columbidae (with the portion dis­played by domestic pigeons as just a small part of a much more extensive trend). He identified a prototype for the entire series in the “turtle-dove” pat­tern, a homogeneous field of feathers, each with a dark spot in the center (see Fig. 5-8): “This ancestral mark is a dark spot rilling the whole central part of the feather, leaving only a narrow distal edge of a lighter color. This mark is still well preserved in some of the old world turtledoves — best in the Oriental turtledove of China and Japan. The chequer of Columba livia differs from the dark center of Turtur orientalis only in form and in having a lateral posi­tion” (1919, p. 23).

From this beginning, the trend moved towards an inexorable end, guided

by two criteria: general reduction in coloration, and concentration of remain­ing color into regionally differentiated bands or swaths. Thus, in the first stages, spots disappear from much of the plumage, while local areas may de­velop strong concentrations. Subsequently, these local intensities diminish in number and area (bars, for example, may become both narrower and fewer in number). Finally, the regional concentrations become effaced as well, and the bird turns light and monochromatic.

In a bold move towards complete generality, Whitman then tried to extend this idea of an archetype, followed by an orthogenetic trend, beyond pigeons and doves to the entire field of avian plumage. He postulated that the uniform turtledove pattern should be regarded as ancestral for all coloration in birds. With differing degrees of heterochrony in the inexorable process of reduction, and varying places and styles of regional concentrations, all observed plu­mages might then be rendered as extensive variations upon a single orthogenetic trend. Even the ocelli of peacocks, for example, can be interpreted as altered spots of the turtle-dove pattern, while their restriction to limited areas of the plumage (however showy and conspicuous the result) denotes one form of participation in the universal trend: “With this [turtle-dove] pattern as an archetype it is possible to get an orientation of the whole field of avian patterns and to thread our way through what before seemed an impenetrable maze of multifarious variations, with no discoverable beginning or end of order” (1919, p. 58).

The mere claim for a trend, even such a pervasive and inevitable series, does not of itself complete an argument for orthogenesis, or internally di­rected variation. After all, both the archetypal turtle-dove pattern and all sub­sequent stages of reduction might be adaptations, externally selected from isotropic Darwinian variation. But Whitman well understood the ingredients required to distinguish true orthogenesis from orthoselection or some other functionalist explanation of trends — namely, (1) evidence that the trend pro­ceeds independently from (or even despite) adaptive pressures from local environments (selection may alter rates or add details, but cannot derail the basic route); and (2) data supporting an internally based directionality of variation available for shaping into evolutionary change (ontogenetic chan­neling in Whitman's view, as we shall see).

On the first criterion, Whitman upheld the inexorable character of a trend towards local differentiation and final effacement, independent of what envi­ronment might favor in functional terms.

The process of evolution in color patterns has been a sweeping one, involving the whole surface and taking the same general direction. The stages reached are various, ranging all the way from the full chequered to the wholely unchequered state; from chequers and bars combined in different proportions to bars alone; from many bars to three, two, one, a remnant, or none; and in all shades of brown, black, gray, red, to pure white. Nowhere in this field of variations do we find any indications that chequers originated in the form of bars at the posterior end of the wing and then spread from behind forward (1919, p. 55).



The trend, Whitman argues, is pervasive and entirely general. He presented (1919) a remarkable vision of inexorable movement through the entire family of pigeons, from a uniformly spotted archetype to some idealized, albinized version of the Holy Ghost, depicted as a pure white dove in many medieval paintings: “When we see all these stages multiplied and varied through some 400 to 500 wild species and 100 to 200 domestic breeds, and in general tend­ing to the same goal, we begin to realize that they are . . . slowly passing phases in the progress of an orthogenetic process of evolution, which seems to have no fixed goal this side of an immaculate monochrome — possibly none short of complete albinism.” Can one conceive a more unpigeonlike state (in both appearance and deed) — at least in our metaphors — than “immaculate”? To the primary spotting agent of cities throughout the world, Whitman thus gave a higher aspiration and the promise of a purer form. As the Psalmist wrote, “Behold, I was shapen in iniquity . . . Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow” (Psalm 51).

The hypothesized putative inexorability of this trend allowed Whitman to explain or interpret many otherwise puzzling phenomena. He seemed most pleased about the unification thereby provided for the two main patterns of domestic pigeons — the empirical source of the entire study. If Darwin had been right, Whitman argued, then the origin of Darwin's postulated ancestral pattern (two-barred) would remain a mystery, and we would also lack any explanation for the subsequent evolution of checkers de novo. But if the trend begins with the turtledove pattern as ancestral, then the checkered state may be easily derived there from, and the two-barred condition becomes just a fur­ther step in reduction and concentration of pigment along an orthogenetic se­ries. (This argument, of course, leaves the origin of the turtledove pattern it­self as an unexplained “primitive term,” but methods of phyletic analysis can at least establish its ancestral status.) “We could not explain how two bars could arise de novo in a clear gray wing surface; but we can see how a sweep­ing reduction process, anteroposterior in direction, would leave two or more rows of chequers cut to dimensions that would coalesce in transverse bars at the posterior end of the wing” (1919, p. 61).

To cite another example of variational puzzles resolved by the orthogenetic trend, Whitman notes that the stock dove, Columba aenas, develops weaker bars than the domestic pigeon and never exhibits any checkers. The trend, having so far surpassed the stage reached by domestic pigeons, no longer per­mits the development of any checkers, even as an occasional variant in highly colored individuals: “We can readily understand why the stock dove, which has, at least in many cases, a vestigial third bar, quite like that in domestic pi­geons, never appears in chequered dress. It is moving in the other direction, and no reversal of course is now open to it” (1919, pp. 60-61).

On the second criterion of channeled variability, Whitman cites three lines of evidence for viewing his orthogenetic sequence as an extension of the ontogenetic pathway. First, in comparison with their own juvenile plumages, adult birds generally develop patterns of coloration that may be designated as “further along” the orthogenetic pathway. In a world of recapitulation, this palpable change in the course of weeks becomes a surrogate for the invisible alterations of past millennia. Whitman uses this ontogenetic evidence to as­sert orthogenesis against his two chief rivals, Darwin and de Vries:

Moreover — and this is as close as we can hope to get to actual seeing — we find that progress of just the kind we are looking for is certainly made in passing from the juvenal [alternate spelling of juvenile, generally ar­chaic in English, but still occasionally used in ornithology] to the adult plumage. This is an ontogenetic change of a few weeks, which we can easily demonstrate by experiment to be progressive and continuous (p. 33). ... Even in the widest departures, when every spot has vanished in the adult plumage, the young bird frequently exhibits more or less per­fect traces of the old marking and sometimes requires several molts to reach its mature condition (p. 58). ... Juvenile phases of color patterns become luminous as recapitulations in the sense of the biogenetic law and do not stand as isolated prodigies of natural selection or as meaning­less exhibitions of mutations (p. 65).



Second, as Eimer also maintained (and for complex reasons rooted both in cultural biases about sexual differences, and in the facts of embryology), Whitman viewed sexual distinctions as products of the same ontogenetic tra­jectory, with males “further along” than females. He then argued that plu­mages of adult male pigeons display more advanced stages of the ortho­genetic series than females of the same population. Third, Whitman argued that, within the adult plumage of individual birds, last-formed feathers devel­oped more advanced characters — as the biogenetic law required, based on its key principle of terminal addition for evolutionary novelty. Thus, three crite­ria, all interpreted as manifestations of ontogeny — differences among molts of a single bird, between sexes of adults, and within the adult plumage by or­der of formation — indicated a pervasive channel of variation, virtually com­pelling evolution into an extended ontogenetic pathway directed towards re­duced and concentrated coloration.

To these categories of ontogenetic evidence, Whitman then added two additional sources of data to buttress his orthogenetic series: (1) From compara­tive anatomy, he asserted that phyletic series, established by criteria indepen­dent of coloration, illustrated the orthogenetic sequence in many parallel lineages. (I doubt the claimed independence in many cases, and Whitman may therefore have advanced a largely circular argument by basing phyletic infer­ences on the supposed trends in color themselves.) (2) From breeding, Whit­man found that selection along the orthogenetic trajectory could only move “forward” from checkers to bars, and never in Darwin's proposed order from bars to checkers. Selection must push, but the phyletic sequence can only pro­ceed in one direction — down the channel of orthogenetic variation:

The conclusion supported by comparative study admits of experimental confirmation. We may take pigeons of the two-barred type, and try to advance from this condition to that of the chequered type, by selecting in each generation birds with the widest bars, and especially any that may have a trace of a third bar. This I have tried continuously for 6 years and with several different stocks. I have not been able to establish a third bar, or to extend chequers in front of the vestigial third bar, which is often found. With purebred birds, not allowed to mingle with chequered birds, I believe it is impossible to advance from bars to the chequered bird state. With chequered pigeons, on the other hand, it is fairly easy to advance in the opposite direction, gradually clearing the field and leaving two bars. The process has been carried to the point of completely elimi­nating the bars (1919, p. 60).



These accumulated sources of evidence led Whitman to strong assertions about the primacy of orthogenesis among rival theories: “The orthogenetic process is the primary and fundamental one” (1919, p. 35). In his boldest statement (1919, p. 191), Whitman advocated a model of inevitable evolu­tionary flow, and explicitly limited the role of natural selection to tinkering with the style and rate of a determined sequence:

The steps are seriated in a causal, genetic order — an order that admits of no transpositions, no reversals, no mutation-skips, and no unpredictable chance intrusions. This series may conceivably be lengthened or short­ened, strengthened or weakened; indeed, we may multiply the number of steps at will; that is, we may provoke one or more steps to arise between any two normal steps; but in that case the new steps will be measured true to the time and place of introduction, and their direction will invari­ably coincide with that of the series as a whole, so that if the time and place of origin are noted, the nature and extent of the strides may be ap­proximately predicted.



Whitman wrote most of his work on pigeons and orthogenesis between 1900 and 1910, the period of greatest agnosticism and debate about evolu­tionary mechanisms (see Kellogg, 1907). He therefore upheld orthogenesis as an explicit preference among competing theories. Rejecting Lamarckism, Whitman faced the macromutationism of de Vries and the selectionism of Darwin as chief rivals. And with Darwin's own pigeons reinterpreted as the bulwark of orthogenesis, we can hardly be surprised that Whitman singled out natural selection for special criticism: “To attempt to explain all this as the work of natural selection would lead into an endless tangle of conjecture that would leave even the simplest facts as unapproachable mysteries. Natu­ral selection has probably had most to do with the end stages in the evolution of characters, but little or no direct influence in originating them. The two-barred condition has been reached in the simplest possible way, not by acci­dental variation or chance mutation, but by progressive modification of a chequered condition previously established” (1919, p. 61).

Whitman's attitude towards natural selection bears closer scrutiny as an aid (still useful today) for clarifying the borderline between two intergrading yet contradictory strategies: (1), using the structuralist and formalist concept of channels in pluralistic reinforcement with natural selection to forge helpful revisions of basic Darwinian theory (the position advocated in this book); or (2) viewing channels as so deep, so unidirectional, and so limiting that such constraints impel evolutionary change from within, leaving selection only to tinker with minor details (a truly anti-Darwinian theory that led the Modern Synthesis to reject orthogenesis completely). I cannot place Whitman on ei­ther end of this continuum — for he argued both sides and usually rested with ambivalence at some middle position. But his writings provide our best illus­tration of this important concept in the logic and historiography of theories.

Whitman's usual account of natural selection grants a distinctly subsid­iary role to Darwin's process. By adaptation's dumb luck, the inexorable pro­cess of reduction in color may occasionally generate a form with utility. At this point, natural selection may intervene to tinker, rearrange, and even strengthen the valued colors. But selection cannot long prevail, for even a use­ful concentration of color must eventually move towards orthogenetic effacement: “Even in cases where natural selection has probably played a conspicu­ous part in modifying and beautifying these marks ... we find that the reducing process has not been brought to a standstill” (1919, p. 62).

Whitman asks us to consider examples from both major components of color — bars and checkers: The bars may be useful as marks of recognition, but they arise by orthogenetic reduction, not natural selection, and Darwin­ian forces cannot maintain them against the stronger internal push to effacement. (Note the interesting admission at the end of this statement that we have yet to fathom the mechanism of a process powerful enough to overcome selection.)





Standing alone on a pale gray ground, these bars would gain immensely in conspicuity [sic] and utility as ornamental recognition marks. The advantage of all this to the species, whatever it be, would be merely an acci­dent of the situation presented at this particular point in a progressive se­ries of modifications. It is conceivable that the utility of the bars might be great enough to give natural selection a chance to step in and bar [pun intended?] the way to further reduction. But the process of obliteration has certainly gone much farther in many other species. There may be stages in the process, which suggest utility; but when we consider the whole series of stages and note that the process runs on, sweeping away the stages, which we imagine to be most useful, we are left with the con­viction that some general principle underlying the course of events has not yet been fathomed (1919, p. 61).



Whitman stresses the same point, in even stronger form, for the few, conspicuous and apparently adaptive checkers of mourning doves. These remaining marks of color are “hanging tough,” stubbornly resisting the orthogenetic washout — but natural selection encountered and preserved this pattern by mere good fortune and must eventually let go:

It is here that we may with some reason suspect the intervention of natu­ral selection. It would, in this case, come in, not as a primary factor to originate a new character, but adventitiously, by invitation, as it were, of favoring predeterminations and environmental conditions.... The orna­mental value of these few chequers and their utility as recognition marks would obviously be enhanced by their isolation in a plain ground, just as a few trees, concealed in a large forest, become conspicuous when left standing alone. These chequers, being on the larger feathers, would have the advantage of size, and so their preeminence, attained without the aid of natural selection, would be an open door through which it might enter and contribute to their improvement. The part possibly taken, however, could at most be but a late and inconsiderable share of the total achieve­ment summed up in these spots; and the course of events in at least one of the allied forms . . . indicates that these marks are destined to be washed out (1919, p. 56).



(Note, once again, the literary theme that authors often reveal their basic commitments, probably quite unconsciously, in their choice of words. In this statement, Whitman refers to natural selection as an “intervention” — an ex­ternality imposed upon the essential process of orthogenesis.)

Nonetheless, Whitman does acknowledge exceptions. In one case (but only here), he does allow that selection may have reversed, albeit in a minor way, the orthogenetic sequence. He notes that iridescence heightens the value of color in adaptive display. Iridescent spots become unusually conspicuous and potentially useful — so much so, that selection may actually strengthen them against the orthogenetic tide. Thus, when the independent trait of iri­descence becomes conjoined with pigmentation, the orthogenetic sequence can be meaningfully impacted by selection. (Whitman properly uses his own criteria, as previously discussed, to gauge the importance of this exception. Juvenile plumages, in this case, develop less conspicuous spotting than adult feathers — so the ontogenetic path belies the orthogenetic sequence): “Irides­cence thus appears to be a phenomenon tending to elevate the spots and bring them within the sphere of utility. It seems not only to put a check upon the re­duction of pigment, but also to actually turn the tide in the opposite direc­tion, for the reduction in this region is not carried so far in the old as in the young male and female, as we shall presently see. As the acquisition of metal­lic brilliancy is accompanied by an exceptional love of display in the male, the chief directing factor in its development may well be natural selection” (1919, p. 43).

These statements might lead a modern evolutionist to view Whitman's orthogenesis as irrelevant to current debates (if not risible in any context). But if Whitman did not come to praise Darwin, he did not write to bury the founding father either. Within his chosen context of primacy for the ortho­genetic pathway, Whitman sought a maximal and fruitful interaction with Darwinism. I know no other orthogeneticist who remained so open to the prospect of a pluralistic consensus (for, in contrast with Whitman, most sci­entists of this school entered the fray with strong anti-Darwinian inclina­tions). As one indication of his more conciliatory stance, Whitman followed the usual attitude of naturalists in accepting adaptation as a central phenome­non. He speaks of the most remarkable phenomenon of the organic world, namely adaptation” (1919, p. 40). He also recognized that orthogenesis can­not be construed as inherently adaptive, whereas Darwin's force actively cre­ates utility. He admits the conundrum that orthogenesis, while true by obser­vation, does not explain the progressive and adaptive character of life — and he realizes that evolutionary biology needs an account, as yet unavailable, for a probable bias towards adaptation in the stages of orthogenetic channels: “But how comes it to pass that these advances are, on the whole, adaptive and progressively so? Recapitulation can only conserve what is given. If it moves on within a progressive way, there must be some way of limiting ger­minal variations to lines of accumulative improvement. Here we find our­selves confronted with the difficulty which has long led investigation and the­ory, and the solution is yet a long way ahead” (1919, p. 180).

Beyond this central acknowledgment, two features of Whitman's think­ing open his particular version of orthogenesis to a broad synthesis with Darwinism.

1. Like Eimer, Whitman developed an interpretation of orthogenesis that could fuse external pushes with internal channels. Eimer also sought a fusion with functionalist views (see pp. 360–365), but he opted for a Lamarckian push as his external source, and explicitly relegated Darwin to an insig­nificant periphery among sources of adaptation. But Whitman rejected Lamarckism and located his external push in natural selection.

Whitman directly criticized Eimer for his negative view of Darwinism, and for subjecting the entire theory of orthogenesis to undeserved derision thereby:

Among the rival theories of natural selection two are especially notewor­thy. One of these is now generally known as orthogenesis. Theodor Eimer was one of the early champions of this theory . . . Eimer's intem­perate ferocity toward the views of Darwin and Weismann, coupled with an equally intemperate advocacy of the notion that organic evolution de­pends upon the inheritance of acquired characters, was enough to preju­dice the whole case of orthogenesis. Moreover, the controversial setting given to the idea of definitely directed variation, without the aid of utility and natural selection, made it difficult to escape the conclusion that orthogenesis was only a new form of the old teleology, from the paralyz­ing domination of which Darwin and Lyell and their followers had res­cued science. Thus, handicapped, the theory of orthogenesis has found little favor (1919, p. 9).



2. Eimer was a polemicist by dint of personality. Whitman, as a great administrator, displayed an opposite temperament in his inclination to seek compromise among good ideas. Whitman believed that major systems, as devised and supported by such brilliant men as Darwin and de Vries, must in­evitably hold at least partial value — and he sought a fruitful union of these systems with his own favored theory of orthogenesis. “Natural selection, orthogenesis, and mutation appear to present fundamental contradictions, but I believe that each stands for truth, and that reconciliation is not distant” (1919, p. 10).

We all know that the theories of de Vries and Darwin eventually reached peace through a recognition that micromutations could act as the source of isotropic Darwinian variation. We regard this fusion as the basis for the Mod­ern Synthesis. A similar and vital task has only begun in our time, but we now live in an age struggling for further union — to join the success of this Modern Synthesis with neglected structuralist and formalist themes of developmental constraint and channeled variation (see Chapters 10 and 11 for my effort in this direction). Whitman surely erred in interpreting a channel of variation — a pathway of potential evolution in either direction — as a one-way street of inevitable change. (The reinterpretation of orthogenetic “one way streets” as “channels” of preferred variability establishes a key “translation” for updat­ing this older and valuable literature into relevance for our modern debates. I also strongly suspect, in opposition to both Darwin and Whitman, that an­cestral pigeons were neither two-barred nor checkered, but both. After all, ancestors exist as populations, not archetypes. Both states persist in continu­ous gradation within many modern populations of pigeons — and this entire channel may well have been expressed among variable adults in ancestral populations.)

However, Whitman's notion that selection does not encounter a full range of isotropic variation, but must work instead with material strongly biased by internal constraint, may supply a key theme for an even higher synthesis of external and internal forces — a theory that will preserve a Darwinian core, but finally and properly incorporate the formalist themes, advocated as cen­tral to evolutionary understanding by many of the finest biologists from the very beginning of our profession. Whitman succinctly stated the basis of this synthesis, but we are only now beginning to learn enough about genetics and development to vindicate his hunches: “Natural selection waits for opportu­nities to be supplied, not by multifarious variation or orderless mutation, but by continuous evolutional processes advancing in definite directions” (1919, p. 13).*





Saltation as a Theory of Internal Impetus:

A Second Formalist Strategy for Pushing Darwinism

to a Causal Periphery





WILLIAM BATESON: THE DOCUMENTATION OF INHERENT DISCONTINUITY





Darwin, as noted earlier, viewed his own accomplishment as dual and distinguishable: establishing the fact of evolution by copious data, and devising a theory, natural selection, to explain the mechanism of change. Darwin also stated that the first achievement must be ranked as more fundamental, for the deepest and most disturbing implications flow from the simple fact of genea­logical continuity itself, whatever the philosophically radical character of nat­ural selection as a cause of change.

William Bateson, speaking at the major Darwinian centennial celebration of 1909, made the same point — and the same assessment of the two achieve­ments:

Darwin's work has the property of greatness in that it may be admired for more aspects than one. For some the perception of the principle of natural selection stands out as his most wonderful achievement to which all the rest is subordinate. Others, among whom I would range myself, look up to him rather as the first who plainly distinguished, collected, and comprehensively studied that new class of evidence from which hereafter a true understanding of the process of evolution may be devel­oped. We each prefer our own standpoint of admiration; but I think that it will be in their wider aspect that his labors will most command the veneration of posterity . . . We shall honor most in him not the rounded merit of finite accomplishment, but the creative power by which he inau­gurated a line of discovery endless in variety and extension (Bateson, 1909, p. 85).



Bateson's and Darwin's motives, however, could scarcely have been more different. Darwin, while ranking his joys, took great pride in both achieve­ments. But Bateson viewed natural selection as an insignificant force and a methodological disaster. In downpeddling natural selection, Bateson pre­sented his argument as an attempt to save Darwin's wider viewpoint from its own worst error, thus preserving the centennial season as a time of triumph.

William Bateson (1861-1926), son of a classical scholar who served as master of St. John's College, Cambridge, shared with Charles Darwin both the enormous advantages of birth and the potential impediment of a slow ed­ucational start. Darwin's father reproached him in 1825: “You care for noth­ing but shooting, dogs, and rat-catching, and you will be a disgrace to your­self and all your family.” Bateson, at a similar stage in his education, was branded as “a vague and aimless boy” by his headmaster at Rugby. Yet Bateson finally focused his interests on zoology and morphology, studying with Sedgwick and Weldon at Cambridge, and from 1883 to 1884 (in an interesting reversal at a time when most aspiring American scholars traveled to Europe for postgraduate work) with W. K. Brooks, the finest American zoolo­gist of his time, at Johns Hopkins.

I generally shun psychological or intellectual biography in this book (both for limitations of space and authorial competence), but I have long been fasci­nated by the structural principle that groups of ideas seem to cohere just as morphological parts often correlate — with possession of one trait implying a set of logically or mechanically appended consequences. The rationale for this book depends, in large part, on such a structural isomorphism between nucleating centers of mutually implicating ideas and the integrity of organic Bauplan, for my notion of a Darwinian essence, construed as a minimal but distinctive set of interpenetrating and almost necessarily correlated concepts, builds the organizational framework of this book.

Whatever the validity of this general framework, I think we will all admit that ideas do coagulate in implicating sets, and that fascination with one — and we get hooked for the damnedest of impenetrable reasons — attracts us to the others as well. The Darwinian set implies a basic intrigue with func­tional and adaptational arguments and includes preferences for gradualism of change, separability of parts, and efficiency of competition. An opposing set — an aggregation that exerted a far lesser, but still identifiable, pull upon Darwin himself (see pp. 330–341), and that motivates the formalist “nucleat­ing center” of this chapter — includes fascination with structurally based cor­relation, evolution by internally generated sources of variation, and suspicion of adaptational scenarios as primary explanations for basic organic design.

For whatever reasons, and from his earliest days in zoology, Bateson felt drawn to the structuralist set* (and to consequent disfavor for Darwinian mechanisms). He quoted and admired the literature on distrust of functional and teleological arguments, from Bacon to Voltaire. Bateson's wife remarked in her memoir (1928, p. 13): “I think he never travelled without a copy of Candide in his pocket.” In 1888, at the beginning of his career, he wrote to his sister: “My brain boils with evolution.” But note the main theme that emerged from this cauldron — the necessary breadth and extent of the net­work of correlations enjoined by any primary change, with inevitable swamping of the primary trigger by the sequelae (a keen foreshadowing of my personal favorite among modern structuralist themes, as embodied in the concept of exaptation — see Chapter 11):

My brain boils with evolution. It is becoming a perfect nightmare to me. I believe now that it is an axiomatic truth that no variation, however small, can occur in any part without other variation occurring in correla­tion to it in all other parts; or, rather, that no system, in which a variation of one part had occurred without such correlated variation in all other parts, could continue to be a system. This follows from what one knows of the nature of an “individual,” whatever that may be ... Further, any variation must always consist chiefly of the secondary correlated varia­tions and to an infinitely small degree of an original primary variation (in Bateson, 1928, p. 39).



Bateson put his formalist and non-Darwinian thoughts together in one of the most interesting biological works of the late 19th century — Materials for the Study of Variation (1894). This work has been read primarily as a defense of saltational variation and change, a brief for structuralism using the “facet flipping” theme of Galton's polyhedron (see pp. 342–351). I will not chal­lenge this primacy, but I do wish to demonstrate that Bateson's book inte­grates a broader set of formalist themes (including distrust of adaptation and suspicion of historical contingency) under a primary concern for saltation and discontinuity as a counter to Darwinism.

Bateson's Materials may be a famous book in retrospect (primarily, I sus­pect, because scholars want to grasp how the man who later invented the word genetics looked upon variation in the last pre-Mendelian decade). But the volume failed in its own time as a long compendium by an unknown au­thor, and a financial disaster. Bateson's wife remembered (1928, pp. 57-58): “The book was not a success — the professors and lecturers of the day did not introduce their students to it. Perhaps, that they should not was to be ex­pected. For a few years the annual arrival of the publisher's account was a dis­mal event, and the book was put “in remainder” and dropped out. The sec­ond volume as such was never written.”

As a rhetorical strategy, many comprehensive works begin with a small log­ical puzzle or anomalous observation. For example (see Gould, 1987b, for details), Burnet and Hutton presented their grand geological systems as solu­tions, in Burnet's case, to the problem of sources for water in Noah's flood; or, for Hutton, as a logical dilemma in final cause (why would a benevolent God, attuned to human needs, allow soil to be made by a process that must eventu­ally erode the earth away). Bateson's Materials also poses its central argument as the solution to a particular puzzle: how can evolution produce a world of taxonomic discontinuity when environmental gradients, as potential impe­tuses for change, are generally continuous: “The differences between species ... are differences of kind, forming a discontinuous series, while the diversi­ties of environment to which they are subject are on the whole differences of degree, and form a continuous series” (1894, p. 16).

Bateson recognized that both Lamarckism and Darwinism, as functionalist mechanisms, posited a flow of information from environment to organism as a basis of adaptive transformation. How then could a continuous envi­ronment yield our world of thinly populated morphospace, with vast gaps between realized designs? “According to both theories [Lamarckism and Darwinism], specific diversity of form is consequent upon diversity of envi­ronment, and diversity of environment is thus the ultimate measure of diver­sity of specific form. Here then we meet the difficulty that diverse environ­ments often shade into each other insensibly and form a continuous series, whereas the specific forms of life which are subject to them on the whole form a discontinuous series. The immense significance of this difficulty will be made more apparent in the course of this work” (1894, p. 5).

For Bateson, a general solution could be derived from logical implications of the argument, prior to any search for causes: nature's discontinuity must arise from the internal workings of organisms:* “Such discontinuity is not in the environment; may it not, then be in the living thing itself?” (1894, p. 17).

Bateson, as a young Turk inspired by ideals of German mechanism and American experimentalism, but working in a more traditional world of de­scriptive natural history, knew what he didn't like about the inferential proce­dures of most Darwinians in his generation: the conjoined tactic of specula­tion based on embryology for phylogenetic reconstruction, and guesswork about utility for inferences about adaptation by natural selection. Bateson lists the two pitfalls of such sterile work: “The first of these is the embryo-logical method, and the second may be spoken of as the study of adaptation. The pursuit of these two methods was the direct outcome of Darwin's work” (1894, p. 7).

Bateson longed to apply the mechanistic style of experimental science to the causes of evolution. If guesswork about externalities had served the field so poorly, why not look to the intrinsic characters of organisms, features that might be resolved by manipulation and by understanding the mechanics of heredity. Variation itself must be taken as a primary phenomenon. Why, at least as an initial strategy, look beyond this palpable and measurable property of populations? Perhaps the causes of evolutionary change lie in variation it­self and not in a superimposed external sorting, as the more complex Darwin­ian mechanism proposed: “Variation, in fact, is evolution. The readiest way, then of solving the problem of evolution is to study the facts of variation” (1894, p. 6).

Bateson notes the fascination of his colleagues for the causes of variation as expressed in the nature of heredity, but holds that the absence of any hard evi­dence has mired the subject in fanciful and speculative hypotheses, from Dar­win's pangenesis to Haeckel's perigenesis. The quest should be postponed for now (though Bateson wouldn't have long to wait, as the Mendelian revival lay just around the corner of the coming century). Meanwhile, an empirical approach might yield great benefits, at least by providing an inductive entry to the difficult subject of causes. Why not, in short, simply gather the facts of variation: “It is especially strange that while few take much heed of the modes of variation or of the visible facts of descent, everyone is interested in the causes of variation and the nature of 'heredity,' a subject of extreme and peculiar difficulty. In the absence of special knowledge, these things are dis­cussed with enthusiasm, even by the public at large. But if we are to make way with this problem, special knowledge is the first need. We must know what special evidence each group of animals and plants can give, and this spe­cialists alone can tell us” (1894, p. ix).

Bateson chose to express this strategy of empirical compilation in the title of his book: “To collect and codify the facts of variation is, I submit, the first duty of the naturalist” (1894, p. vi). Brave words, to be sure, but Bateson rec­ognized that such a complex and multifarious subject could not be resolved simply by toting the relative frequencies of an empirical list. He also under­stood that the very idea of a totally unbiased listing could only operate as a self-serving fiction to bolster a myth of perfect scientific objectivity. Bateson recognized a pervasive bias in traditional accounts of variation — strong pref­erences for continuity and gradualism, as expressed in the old Leibnizian and Linnaean aphorism, natura non facit saltum: “First there is in the minds of some persons an inherent conviction that all natural processes are continuous . . . Secondly, variation has been supposed to be always continuous and to proceed by minute steps because changes of this kind are so common in varia­tion” (1894, p. 16). Bateson's list, therefore, would be a purposive account of a particular sort of variation: “If facts of the old kind will not help, let us seek facts of a new kind” (1894, p. vi).

Since Bateson sought the causes of evolution in variation itself, and since he viewed discontinuity as the primary fact of natural history, discontinuous variation among organisms within populations became his favored source of evolutionary change. Materials for the Study of Variation is not an unbiased compendium of all organic mutability, but rather an explicit attempt to cata­log discontinuous variation as a source of insight into internally driven causes of evolution. The subtitle of the book explicitly refutes any claim to balance or comprehensiveness among styles: “Treated with Especial Regard to Dis­continuity in the Origin of Species.”

Bateson divided variation into meristic (for serially and symmetrically repeated, countable and discontinuous structures) and substantive (for ordi­nary continuous variability). As an obvious ploy to promote his preference for locating the causes of evolution in discontinuity of variation, the meristic category commanded his primary attention. Bateson devotes the entire text of Materials to compiling examples of meristic variation. He planned, but never wrote or even seriously began, a second volume on substantive variation.

(Bateson left a substantial legacy of biological terminology. He is best known, of course, as the inventor of the word genetics, but Materials includes two new terms of later importance — meristic for this general style of varia­tion, and homeosis for a subset that has since become central in modern evo­lutionary and developmental biology; see Chapter 10.)

The evolutionary import of Bateson's book may be summarized in three characteristic features of his argument for saltational variation and change, with a subsequent fourth theme then centered upon his discussion of implica­tions for Darwinism.

Nature of the examples. Materials are, above all else, a compendium of examples of discontinuous variation in meristic characters. Bateson begins with a long sequence of chapters (pp. 87-422) on linear series, starting with arthropod segments, moving through vertebrae and ribs, where Bateson pres­ents the “type” cases of homeosis, and proceeding to branchial openings, mammae, teeth and digits. The second sequence of chapters (pp. 423-566) treats symmetrically repeated structures under three headings: radial series, bilateral series, and secondary symmetry and duplication. Although Bateson adopted a convention of presenting facts in small type and interpretation in a larger font, he remained true to his own version of the Kantian dictum that percepts without concepts are blind — for even the factual small-type listings contain implicit interpretations for his worldview, and against Darwin's.

As his primary theme, Bateson emphasizes a basic implication of meristic variation. Segments must be conceptualized as discrete anatomical forms, and supernumeraries (or deletions) are therefore usually complete (or entirely suppressed). Half an added segment usually denotes a structural and func­tional absurdity, in principle. Merism, by its very nature, implies discontinu­ity in construction and change. Bateson writes, for example, about 12-jointed antennae within a group of normally 11-jointed beetles:

Would it be expected that the longicorn Prionidae, most of which have the unusual number of 12 antennary joints, did, as they separated from the other longicorns which have 11 joints, gradually first acquire a new joint as a rudiment which in successive generations increased? ... If any­one will try to apply such a view to hundreds of like examples in arthro­pods, of difference in number of joints and appendages of near allies ... he will find that by this supposition of continuity in variation he is led into endless absurdity. Surely it must be clear that in many such cases to suppose that the limb came through a phase in which one of its divisions was half-made or one of its joints half-grown, is to suppose that in the comparatively near past it was an instrument of totally different char­acter from that which it has in either of the two perfect forms. But no such supposition is called for. With evidence that transition of this nature may be discontinuously effected the difficulty is removed (1894, pp. 410-411).



Whereas this basic argument contravenes gradualism, a second implication then disputes natural selection. Supposed anomalies of discontinuous varia­tion often seem no less structurally “perfect” than normal forms. Why, then, do we so confidently ascribe the “normal” forms to long honing by natural selection working upon continuous variation? Should we not rather conclude that, since normal and anomalous variants may be equally well constructed, both categories arise by internal regulation? Of roaches with four-jointed tarsi (instead of the normal five), Bateson writes:*

The four-jointed tarsus occurring thus sporadically, as a variety, is not less definitely constituted than the five-jointed type, and the proportion of its several joints is not less constant. It is scarcely necessary to point out that these facts give no support to the view that the exactness or per­fection with which the proportions of the normal form are approached is a consequence of selection. It appears rather, that there is two possible conditions, the one of five joints and the other with four, each being a po­sition of organic stability. Into either of these the tarsus may fall; and though it is still conceivable that the final choice between these two may have been made by selection, yet it cannot be supposed that the accuracy and completeness with which either condition is assumed is the work of selection, for the “sport” is as definite as the normal (1894, pp. 64-65).



In a further move to complete the basic argument within a supposed compendium of objectively listed facts, Bateson emphasizes homology between the teratology of individuals in one population and the normal morphology of a related species — with an obvious implication of transformation by salta­tional variation. Fusion of bilaterally symmetrical organs in the mid line (or fission of singletons into pairs on the antimeres) establishes a major class of cases:

A normally unpaired organ standing in the middle line of a bilateral sym­metry may divide into two so as to form a pair of organs; and conversely, a pair of organs normally placed apart from each other on either side of a middle line may be compounded together so as to form a single organ in the middle line. In animals and plants nothing is more common than for different forms to be distinguished from each other by the fact that an organ standing in the middle line of one is in another represented by two organs, one on either side. The facility therefore with which each of these two conditions may arise from the other by discontinuous varia­tion is of considerable importance (1894, p. 448).



The physical basis of discontinuity. Early in his studies, Bateson developed an insight, a sort of epiphany in his own assessment, that would shape his views (haunt might be a better word) throughout his ca­reer. His emphasis on discontinuity, his dislike of Darwinism, his inability to come to terms with chromosomal theory, all reflect this central vision of his thinking. Bateson decided that discontinuously repeated organic structures bore isomorphic, and therefore common causal, similarity to physical phe­nomena produced by waves and vibrations. He therefore sought a physical cause for heredity in some wave-like form of energy — the “vibratory the­ory” in his own words — and he could therefore never fully accept a particulate basis for genetics. In 1891, he wrote with great excitement to his sis­ter, stating that he dared not even hope to have an idea of such import ever again:

Did I tell you anything about my new vibratory theory of repetition of parts in animals and plants? I have been turning it over again lately, and feel sure there is something in it. It is the best idea I ever had or am likely to have — do you see what I mean? — divisions between segments, petals, etc. are internodal lines like those in sand figures made by sound, i.e. lines of maximum vibratory strain, while the midsegmental lines and the petals, etc. are the nodal lines, or places of minimum movement. Hence all the patterns and recurrence of patterns in animals and plants — hence the perfection of symmetry — hence bilaterally symmetrical variation, and the completeness of repetition whether of a part repeated in a radial or linear series etc. etc. I am, as you see, in a great fluster (in Bateson, 1928, p. 42).



In his next letter, he added: “You'll see — it will be a commonplace of educa­tion, like the multiplication table or Shakespeare, before long!”

Materials do not discuss the vibratory theme at length, if only because Bateson chose to organize the book as a compendium of data — and he could present no factual support for his suspicions about the production and inheri­tance of discontinuous variation. Still, he advanced several conjectures about the construction of phenotypic discontinuity from underlying continuity by a simple physical or chemical impetus. He attempts, for example, to analogize the discrete concentric rings of eyespots on lepidopteran wings with pond ripples (metaphorically) and, in greater hope of causal isomorphism, with chemical reactions:

A whole eyespot may come, or it may go ... leaving the field of the cell plain and without a speck. The suggestion is strong that the whole series of rings may have been formed by some one central disturbance, some­what as a series of concentric waves may be formed by the splash of a stone thrown into a pool. It is especially interesting to remember that the formation even of a number of concentric rings of different colors from an animal pigment by the even diffusion of one reagent from a center oc­curs actually in Gmelin's test for bile-pigments. Bile is spread on a white plate and a drop of nitric acid yellow with nitrous acid is dropped on it. As the acid diffuses itself distinct rings of yellow, red, violet, blue, and green are formed concentrically around it by the progressive oxidation of the bile-pigment ... This example is merely given as an illustration of the possibility that a series of discontinuous chemical effects may be pro­duced in concentric zones by a single central disturbance (1894, p. 292).



Rarely missing an opportunity for a dig at Darwinism, Bateson then adds that, with the chemical analogy, we at least hope to find a cause, whereas the standard adaptational speculation can make no such claim: “As to the func­tion of the ocellar markings nothing is known, and I am not aware that any suggestion has been made which calls for serious notice” (1894, p. 294).

Writing more generally on the same theme, Bateson tries to attribute dis­crete color classes directly to the chemical stability of pigments — and to dis­miss the alternative functional explanation of adaptational guesswork about the utility of discontinuous difference. (This passage occurs in Bateson's only short discussion of substantive rather than meristic variation — the category intrinsically less favorable to his preference for discontinuity. Thus, he strives for explanatory generality across all classes of variation): “It would, I think, be simpler to regard the constancy of the tints of the several species and the rarity of the intermediate varieties as a direct manifestation of the chemical stability or instability of the coloring matters, rather than as the consequences of environmental selection for some special fitness as to whose nature we can make no guess. For we do know the phenomenon of chemical discontinuity, whatever may be its ultimate causes, but of these hypothetical fitnesses we know nothing, not even whether they exist or no” (1894, p. 48).

In his summation, Bateson reiterates his conviction that meristic disconti­nuity may represent a necessary phenotypic expression of an underlying me­chanical regularity, and not a set of adaptations gradually crafted by natural selection: “To sum up: There is a possibility that meristic division may be a strictly mechanical phenomenon, and that the perfection and symmetry of the process, whether in type or in variety, may be an expression of the fact that the forms of the type or of the variety represent positions in which the forces of division are in a condition of mechanical stability” (1894, p. 71). In addi­tion, Bateson could not resist a final and explicit anti-Darwinian dig in stating that such symmetrical forms would “owe their perfection to mechanical con­ditions and not to selection or to any other gradual process” (1894, p. 70).

Suspicion of history (as well as adaptation) as a cause of morphology. The pure formalist or structuralist not only rejects func­tional accounts based on slow building for utility, but also tries to avoid any appeal to deep history in explaining the origin of morphology. The pure structuralist prefers ahistorical accounts (see Chapter 11, Section 1, for modern versions), and seeks to explain form in terms of chemical and mechanical forces now operating through development. (Structuralists do not deny, of course, that history sets the presence of one mechanics, rather than another, in any particular lineage. But the analysis of immediate causes for current anatomies must still invoke present and intrinsic workings.)

Bateson best illustrates his full allegiance to the structuralist program by interpreting a range of putatively historical phenomena in terms of contem­porary mechanics. He admits, for example, that highly variable parts, like mammalian third molars, often have little functional utility — and may there­fore be “permitted” to range widely by a history of failing function. But Bateson still seeks a primary explanation in terms of current construction: “The oft-repeated statement that 'useless' parts are specially variable, finds little support in the facts of variation, except in as far as it is a misrepresenta­tion of another principle. The examples taken to support this statement are commonly organs standing at the end of a meristic series of parts, in which there is a progression or increase of size and degree of development, starting from a small terminal member” (1894, pp. 78-79).

Similarly, the features that we call atavisms and attribute to past echoes should be viewed as alternate mechanical pathways. In this case, a Darwinian might invoke both styles of explanation, for even a historical vestige must be built along a current developmental route. But Bateson did not seem to grasp this necessary duality, and he often used the second aspect (mechanical path­way of building) to castigate the first (adaptational basis) — thus illustrating, by his error, the near exclusivity of his structuralist interpretations. Bateson uses simple mechanical analogs to make his point:

But all that we know is that now and then it shoots wide and hits an­other mark, and we assume from this that it would not have hit if it had not aimed at it in a bygone age. To apply this to any other matter would be absurd. We might as well say that a bubble would not be round if the air in it had not learned the trick of roundness by having been in a bub­ble before: that if in a bag after pulling out a lot of white balls I find a to­tally red one, this proves that the bag must have once been full of red balls, or that the white ones must all have been red in the past (1894, p. 78).



Evolutionary conclusions and implications for darwinism. The central thesis of Materials can be stated positively and succinctly: much variation (or at least the evolutionarily significant fraction) is discontin­uous, mechanically and chemically built through heredity, and often well formed (and therefore potentially useful) by intrinsic construction. The pri­mary cause of evolution, a process that also tends to be discontinuous, must therefore be located directly in the rules, patterns and directions of variation: “Is it not then possible that the discontinuity of species may be a consequence and expression of the discontinuity of variation?” (1894, p. 69).

But Bateson makes few positive claims in this mode. Rather he presents most arguments in a context of refutation — with Darwinian natural selec­tion as the prime target, particularly the themes of insensibly gradual change and selective pressure guided by utility. In so proceeding, Bateson expresses no hostility for Darwin himself. Moreover, his strategy in separating Darwin's factual and theoretical achievements in order to render high personal praise also makes sense in this context. Bateson's style of refutation extends far be­yond biology into broader and contemporary themes of science. Bateson re­garded himself as an experimental modernist, upholding ideals of tractable science against a sterile speculative tradition that had taken hold in two areas of natural history — the guesswork of phyletic reconstruction and the hypo­thetical assignment of adaptive utility.

Bateson's attitude towards natural selection and adaptation provides a good indication of his procedures and prejudices. As stated above, Bateson uses several facts of discontinuous variation to downplay selection as a cre­ative force. Consider just two arguments:

1. If rare and discontinuous variants may originate as well formed and potentially useful at their sudden appearance, why assume that normal forms must be gradually crafted to perfection by natural selection: “The existence of sudden and discontinuous variation, the existence, that is to say, of new forms having from their first beginning more or less of the kind of perfection that we associate with normality, is a fact that disposes, once and for all, of the attempt to interpret all perfection and definiteness of form as the work of selection. The study of variation leads us into the presence of whole classes of phenomena that are plainly incapable of such interpretation” (1894, p. 568).

2. If variation is inherently discontinuous and often large in effect, then selection can only choose among alternatives presented by internal causes, and therefore cannot operate as a creative force in evolutionary change. (Here, of course, Bateson merely recounts the standard argument on “creativity” ad­vanced by nearly all non-Darwinian theorists.) Bateson, for example, writes about butterfly wingtips that exhibit either red or purple, but nothing in be­tween: “It is easier to suppose that the change from red to purple was from the first complete, and that the choice offered to selection was between red and purple” (1894, p. 73).

But Bateson devotes his main thrust of argument to a methodological theme — to designating the tradition of adaptationist “story telling” as a poor substitute for experiment and proof. Some of the most powerful statements against this conventional, and still all too common, form of evolutionary con­jecturing may be found in Bateson's 1894 book and later writings.

Bateson acknowledges the allure and fascination of adaptationist conjec­ture: “This study of adaptation and of the utility of structures exercises an ex­traordinary fascination over the minds of some . . . The amount of evidence collected with this object is now enormous, and most astonishing ingenuity has been evoked in the interpretation of it” (1894, p. 10).

Yet this so-called evidence, Bateson then asserts, represents little more than a set of conjectures about possible benefits, not a proof of actual (and grad­ual) construction for utility:

In these discussions we are continually stopped by such phrases as, “if such and such a variation then took place and was favorable,” or, “we may easily suppose circumstances in which such and such a variation if it occurred might be beneficial,” and the like. The whole argument is based on such assumptions as these — assumptions, which, were, they found in the arguments of Paley or of Butler, we could not too scornfully ridicule. “If,” say we with much circumlocution “the course of nature followed the lines we have suggested, then, in short, it did.” That is the sum of our argument (1894, p. v).



We might recognize the bankruptcy of such an approach, Bateson claims, if we looked inside ourselves and acknowledged that we undoubtedly could, and almost surely would, concoct an adaptationist scenario for any case better explained in another way (as in the establishment, through random processes, of a rare discontinuous variant as the norm of a small island popu­lation):

In any case of variation there are a hundred ways in which it may be beneficial or detrimental. For instance, if the “hairy” variety of the moor­hen became established on an island, as many strange varieties have been, I do not doubt that ingenious persons would invite us to see how the hairiness fitted the bird in some special way for life in that island in particular. Their contention would be hard to deny, for on this class of speculation the only limitations are those of the ingenuity of the author (1894, p. 79).



This lamentable practice, Bateson argues, giving natural history such a low reputation among the sciences, will only end when naturalists accept an alter­nate structuralist biology — for the key concepts of discontinuity and correla­tion must dismantle the strict adaptationist's necessary (but often unstated) view of organisms as malleable aggregations of independently improvable parts: “For the crude belief that living beings are plastic conglomerates of miscellaneous attributes, and that order of form and symmetry have been im­pressed upon this medley by selection only; and that by variation any of these attributes may be subtracted or any other attribute added in indefinite pro­portion, is a fancy which the study of variation does not support” (1894, p. 80).

Though Bateson, throughout the book, uses the rhetorical device of oppos­ing discontinuity in variation to Darwinian gradualism, he also stresses the positive theme that internally generated saltations may represent, in them­selves, the long-sought creative component of evolutionary change (with se­lection then operating as a subsidiary device to spread these novel features through populations): “If the evidence went no further than this the result would be of use, though its use would be rather to destroy than to build up. But besides this negative result there is a positive result too, and the same dis­continuity which in the old structure had no place, may be made the frame­work round which a new structure may be built” (1894, p. 568). As a final contrast, and with a positive finish, Bateson writes: “A presumption is cre­ated that the discontinuity of which species is an expression has its origin not in the environment, nor in any phenomenon of adaptation, but in the intrin­sic nature of organisms themselves, manifested in the original discontinuity of variation” (1894, p. 567).

Bateson ends his Materials with a striking plea (akin to an equally passion­ate statement in the preface to Simpson, 1944) for an end to the dichotomy of valuation that breeds discord and miscommunication between experimen­talists and field naturalists. Bateson himself favored the experimental ap­proach, and wrote his book to compel an appreciation of this “unfamiliar” methodology by his fellow naturalists. But he also understood that labora­tory work cannot solve the problems of evolution without detailed knowl­edge of natural history derived from the field — and his book presents a mag­nificent compendium of empirical examples, spanning nearly 1000 pages, and mostly drawn from traditional descriptive literature. The integration so devoutly to be wished, Bateson argues, will arise from the study of varia­tion — for naturalists can record the variety and understand its sway and distribution, while experimentalists can manipulate the results and hope to learn causes. Above all, variation must become the focus of union because the causes of evolution, including the origin of species, must lie within these Ma­terials, properly ordered, manipulated, and explained. Bateson's plea deserves citation in extenso:

These things attract men of two classes, in tastes and temperament dis­tinct, each having little sympathy or even acquaintance with the work of the other. Those of the one class have felt the attraction of the problem. It is the challenge of nature that calls them to work. But disgusted with the superficiality of “naturalists” they sit down in the laboratory to the solu­tion of the problem, hoping that the closer they look, the more truly will they see. For the living things out-of-doors, they care little... With the other class it is the living thing that attracts, not the problem. To them the methods of the first school are frigid and narrow... With senses quickened by the range and fresh air of their own work, they feel keenly how crude and inadequate are these poor generalities, and for what a small and conventional world they are devised. Disappointed with the results, they condemn the methods of the others, knowing nothing of their real strength.... Beginning as naturalists they end as collectors, de­spairing of the problem, turning for relief to the tangible business of clas­sification, accounting themselves happy if they can keep their species apart, . . . Thus each class misses that which in the other is good. But when once it is seen that, whatever be the truth as to the modes of evolu­tion, it is by the study of variation alone that the problem can be at­tacked, and that to this study both classes of observation must equally contribute, there is once more a place for both crafts side by side: for though many things spoken of in the course of this work are matters of doubt or of controversy, of this one thing there is no doubt, that if the problem of species is to be solved at all it must be by the study of varia­tion (1894, pp. 574-575).



For biologists, 1900 marks far more than the arbitrary turning of a century (in one mode of reckoning) because, in that year, the barrier that all evolu­tionists recognized as the chief impediment to further insight — ignorance about the causal basis of heredity — began to crumble with the rediscovery of Mendel's principles. Bateson himself well understood the strict limits that necessarily impeded further progress until the basis of heredity and variation could be established. He wrote Materials as an empirical list, largely because he could propose no causal guide to variation, and therefore hoped that a compendium might suggest some hints, or at least prove useful faute de mieux. He expressed frustration about this missing key at the end of Mate­rials, and proposed that the basis of heredity be sought in breeding experi­ments: “But beyond a general impression, in this, the most fascinating part of the whole problem, there is still no guide. The only way in which we may hope to get at the truth is by the organization of systematic experiments in breeding, a class of research that calls perhaps for more patience and more resources than any other form of biological inquiry. Sooner or later, such in­vestigations will be undertaken and then we shall begin to know” (1894, p. 574).

Bateson invented the word “genetics” (in 1905). He then fought for dis­crete inheritance against the biometrical school of Pearson and Weldon, made many important Mendelian discoveries during the first decade of the new sci­ence (application to animals as well as plants, elucidation of the phenomena of epistasis and linkage), founded the Journal of Genetics, and served as an effective spokesman for the new world order. In a late address of 1924 (pub­lished in 1928), he contrasted the Mendelian before and after, with special reference to Materials: “Only those who remember the utter darkness before the Mendelian dawn can appreciate what has happened. Stories, which then seemed mere fantasies, are now common sense. When I was collecting exam­ples of variation in 1890, I remember well reading the fanciers' tales about dun tumbler pigeons being almost always hens, and about the 'curious effects of crossing' with cinnamon canaries, but I would never have dared to repeat them” (in Bateson, 1928, pp. 405-406).

In this light, the continuing saga of Bateson and evolutionary theory should tell a tale of pleasure and progress. He should, like de Vries (see pp. 425–439), posit an identity of his favored discontinuous variants with major Mendelian mutations, argue that the riddle of evolution has been solved in his terms, and proceed forward to greater discovery and satisfaction (at least until Fisher and others inaugurate the Modern Synthesis by uphold­ing the efficacy, and Mendelian character, of small-scale continuous varia­tion as well — a recognition that did not dawn widely until after Bateson's death).

In fact, Bateson's later career did not follow this happy scenario at all. Instead, he walked the all too common ontogenetic trajectory from young Turk to old fogey. He did rejoice in the potentially Mendelian character of discontinuity, but he altered none of his earlier views and became, in the eyes of most younger contemporaries, an increasingly dyspeptic and conser­vative force (Arthur Koestler's characterization of Bateson, as a vitriolic op­ponent in the sad case of the Neo-Lamarckian Paul Kammerer, paints a color­ful, though not entirely fair, portrait of Bateson's later career — see Koestler, 1971). Bateson continued his hostility to Darwinian and all other forms of functionalist explanation (hence his brutal opposition to Kammerer and other Lamarckians). Above all, the new genetics eventually ran away from him, primarily because he would not budge from his old, controlling belief in physical causation of phenotypic discontinuity by underlying wave-like or vi­bratory motions. Bateson took this idea so literally that he could never accept the “materialistic” chromosomal account of inheritance. Thus, he continued to insist, following his beloved “vibratory” theory, that transmission of he­reditary information, while obeying the Mendelian rules of course, must be promulgated by force and motion, rather than by discrete particles.

Bateson delivered the Silliman lectures at Yale University in 1907 and, after considerable delay, published the text as Problems of Genetics in 1913, his major post-Mendelian statement on heredity and evolution. His views had changed very little from the themes and claims discussed in Materials in 1894. He rejoices in the Mendelian discovery, and gives a good account of early work, while focusing on the limits for evolutionary theory — particularly on his old problem of explaining meristic discontinuity, and his hope for a mechanical explanation based on waves and energy. “In Mendelian analysis we have now, it is true, something comparable with the clue of chemistry, but there is still little prospect of penetrating the obscurity which envelops the mechanical aspect of our phenomena” (1913, p. 32).

But if we cannot yet fathom meristic variation, at least we may infer that inheritance must be vibratory, not particulate. Ironically, then, Bateson com­mits his greatest error in thinking about his favorite phenomenon — for he never suspected the integrating theme that particles might code for substances controlling rates of processes:

When however we pass from the substantive to the meristic characters, the conception that the character depends on the possession by the germ of a particle of a specific material becomes even less plausible. Hardly by any effort of imagination can we see any way by which the division of the vertebral column into x segments or into y segments, or of a Medusa into four segments or into six, can be determined by the possession or by the want of a material particle. The distinction must surely be of a differ­ent order. If we are to look for a physical analogy at all we should rather be led to suppose that these differences in segmental numbers corre­spond with changes in the amplitude or number of dividing waves than with any change in the substance or material divided (1913, p. 35).



In a statement reminiscent of D'Arcy Thompson (see p. 1179), Bateson expresses his hopes for mathematical analysis in morphology:

It is in the geometrical phenomena of life that the most hopeful field for the introduction of mathematics will be found. If anyone will compare one of our animal patterns, say that of a zebra's hide, with patterns known to be of a purely mechanical production, he will need no argu­ment to convince him that there must be an essential similarity between the processes by which the two kinds of patterns were made . . . Pat­terns mechanically produced are of many and very diverse kinds. One of the most familiar examples, and one presenting some especially striking analogies to organic patterns, is that provided by the ripples of a mack­erel sky, or those made in a flat sandy beach by the wind or the ebbing tide. With a little research we can find among the ripple marks, and in other patterns produced by simple physical means, the closest parallels to all the phenomena of striping as we see them in our animals . . . We cannot tell what in the zebra corresponds to the wind or the flow of the current, but we can perceive that in the distribution of the pigments... a rhythmical disturbance has been set up which has produced the pattern we see; and I think we are entitled to the inference that in the formation of patterns in animals and plants mechanical forces are operating which ought to be, and will prove to be, capable of mathematical analysis (1913, p. 36).



Though Bateson never found his underlying vibrations, his faith in their existence as bearers of heredity fueled his primary anti-Darwinian argument for discontinuous variation, and consequent evolution by internally generated saltation:

When the essential analogy between these various classes of phenomena is perceived, no one will be astonished at, or reluctant to admit, the real­ity of discontinuity in variation, and if we are as far as ever from know­ing the actual causation of pattern we ought not to feel surprised that it may arise suddenly or be suddenly modified in descent. Biologists have felt it easier to conceive the evolution of a striped animal like a zebra from a self colored type like a horse ... as a process involving many intergradational steps; but so far as the pattern is concerned, the change may have been decided by a single event, just as the multitudinous and ordered rippling of a beach may be created or obliterated at one tide (1913, pp. 36-37).



Bateson remained obstinate, and no closer to a solution, as the chromo­somal theory became a foundation of modern biology. In 1924, he wrote to the great mathematician G. H. Hardy: “We have had some absurd attempts — mostly from biometricians — to apply mathematics to biology, but as I said my hope is still that I may live to see mathematics applied to biology prop­erly. The most promising place for a beginning, I believe, is the mechanism of pattern.”

Bateson became more despondent about evolutionary theory in his later years, while remaining as stubborn as ever about his personal certainties. He visited Canada in 1922, and delivered a famous address entitled “Evolu­tionary faith and modern doubts” to the annual meeting of the American As­sociation for the Advancement of Science. These were not happy times of consensus for evolutionary theory in general, but Bateson promulgated a par­ticularly bleak vision, clearly colored by the failure of his personal hopes for a vibratory theory of heredity. He lamented that his closing plea of 1894, for integration of lab and field, had been thwarted thus far: “I had expected that genetics would provide at once common ground for the systematist and the laboratory worker. This hope has been disappointed. Each still keeps apart. Systematic literature grows precisely as if the genetical discoveries had never been made and the geneticists more and more withdraw each into his special 'claim' — a most lamentable result. Both are to blame . . . The separation be­tween the laboratory men and the systematists already imperils the work, I might almost say the sanity, of both” (1922, in 1928, p. 397).

Bateson then issued his famous pronouncement — one of the most widely repeated lines in the history of evolutionary writing: “Less and less was heard about evolution in genetical circles, and now the topic is dropped. When stu­dents of other sciences ask us what is now currently believed about the origin of species we have no clear answer to give. Faith has given place to agnosti­cism” (1922, in 1928, p. 391).

Bateson did not fully understand the political and distinctively American context in which he had uttered these lines — the early days of agitation by William Jennings Bryan and the creationist movement for the first wave of anti-evolution laws that culminated in the Scopes Trial of 1925. Creationists seized upon Bateson's words, with their favored and unvarying tactic (still continuing today!) of willful distortion for rhetorical effect. What! A world's leading expert, British no less, from Darwin's own land, claiming to be (dare the word be uttered) agnostic about evolution! Bateson, appalled and an­gered, spent much time writing letters and articles to stress the point that we must still emphasize today against the rhetoric and similar distortions of modern creationists: theoretical doubt and debate do not alter the factual sta­tus of a subject; the fact of evolution and the theory of natural selection do not build the indivisible Eng and Chang of natural history, but rather specify claims of a different order.

But if Bateson became suffused with doubt about evolutionary mecha­nisms, he never wavered in his conviction that functionalist accounts in gen­eral, and Darwinian gradualism in particular, must rank as subsidiary and pe­ripheral to a more valid formalism. Characteristically (for he never shunned controversy), Bateson chose the occasion of Darwin's most important cente­nary celebration — at Cambridge University in 1909 — to present his strongest critique of adaptation from a formalist perspective. He begins — using a fa­vored physical analogy — with the venerable and standard critique of creativ­ity: natural selection, as a negative force, can make nothing, but can only choose among variants produced by another process:

To begin with, we must relegate selection to its proper place. Selection permits the viable to continue and decides that the nonviable shall per­ish; just as the temperature of our atmosphere decides that no liquid car­bon shall be found on the face of the earth: but we do not suppose that the form of the diamond has been gradually achieved by a process of se­lection. So again, as the course of descent branches in the successive gen­erations, selection determines along which branch evolution shall pro­ceed, but it does not decide what novelties that branch shall bring forth (1909, p. 96).



In a briefer epitome, Bateson had previously written (1904, in 1928, p. 238): “Selection is a true phenomenon; but its function is to select, not to create.”

Bateson then launches a two-pronged attack. In a first methodological critique, bordering on meanness (despite his cogent point), Bateson inverts Darwin's intent in proposing small-scale, continuous, isotropic variability as the source of evolutionary change. Darwin used this claim as a brilliant ploy for tractability in a context of ignorance about the nature of variation (see pp. 141–146) — for the assumption of isotropy allowed variation to play the role of supplying “raw material” only, thus permitting the search for mecha­nisms of evolutionary change to proceed notwithstanding. (An insistence that knowledge of the mechanisms of variation must underlie any explanation of phyletic change would have stymied the development of evolutionary theory and practice, for Darwin's world knew effectively nothing about the causes of variation, and possessed no techniques for obtaining the requisite informa­tion.) But for Bateson, the Darwinian claim of isotropy could only impede the development of a proper theory — for Bateson believed that the causes of change lay in variation, and an appeal to look elsewhere must therefore fore­close progress. Moreover, the Darwinian's favored “elsewhere” too often en­couraged sterile exercises in adaptational guesswork, rather than a rigorous approach to assessing utility. Making an analogy to his favorite work of Vol­taire (see p. 397), Bateson wrote:

While it could be said that species arise by an insensible and impercepti­ble process of variation, there was clearly no use in tiring ourselves by trying to perceive that process. This labor saving counsel found great fa­vor. All that had to be done to develop evolution theory was to discover the good in everything, a task which, in the complete absence of any con­trol or test whereby to check the truth of the discovery, is not very oner­ous. The doctrine “que tout est au mieux” [that all is for the best — the Leibnizian line that Voltaire places in the mouth of Dr. Pangloss] was therefore preached with fresh vigor, and examples of that illuminating principle were discovered with a facility that Pangloss himself might have envied, till at last even the spectators wearied of such dazzling per­formances (1909, pp. 99-100).



In a second substantive critique, Bateson sought to limit the domain of nat­ural selection — a standard tactic based upon an argument of relative frequency. He had already extirpated the heart of Darwinian importance by la­beling selection as a negative force. He now sought a further restriction by shrinking the frequency of selection's application even further. Many crea­tures may not be so well adapted as tradition dictates; natural selection need not always be working (“daily and hourly scrutinizing” in Darwin's words, 1859, p. 84), or, if working, not necessarily operating with substantial power: “May not our present ideas of the universality and precision of adaptation be greatly exaggerated? The fit of organism to its environment is not after all so very close — a proposition unwelcome perhaps, but one which could be illus­trated by very copious evidence. Natural selection is stern, but she has her tol­erant moods” (1909, p. 100).

Moreover, many structures usually regarded as direct adaptations may originate as sequelae or side-consequences of other changes (“spandrels” in my terminology — Chapter 11, and Gould and Lewontin, 1979). Organic in­tegration, indissoluble by selection, may represent a more important morpho­logical phenomenon than selective scrutiny part by part: “I feel quite sure that we shall be rightly interpreting the facts of nature if we cease to expect to find purposefulness wherever we meet with definite structures or patterns. Such things are, as often as not, I suspect rather of the nature of toolmarks, mere incidents of manufacture, benefiting their possessor not more than the wire-marks in a sheet of paper, or the ribbing on the bottom of an oriental plate renders those objects more attractive in our eyes” (1909, pp. 100-101).

I have presented this exegesis of Bateson in such detail because he so explicitly presented the formalist viewpoint as a direct alternative to Darwinism. His own style emphasized the facet-flipping (or saltational) theme of Galton's polyhedron, but he understood the place of directional variation in the gen­eral argument, and he expressed support for the second theme of ortho­genesis with a conventional formalist emphasis on predictability and inter­nally generated order, writing for example (1924, in 1928, p. 407): “What we have learned of variation, especially of the incidents of parallel variations, has taught us that many varietal forms owe their origin to a process of unpacking a definite pre-existing complex, with the consequence that, given the series of varieties to which one species is liable, successful predictions may some­times be made as to the terms which will be found in allied series . . . These symptoms of order and variation have prepared our minds, and there may well be a sense in which orthogenesis will be found to denote a valid principle.”

Bateson therefore defended the purest example I know, among major 20th century thinkers, of a conscious and fully developed formalist philosophy harnessed to an explicitly anti-Darwinian theory. His formulation demon­strates that the dichotomy between structuralist and functionalist thought, the conceptual basis and primary theme of this chapter, cannot be regarded as an idiosyncratic or artificial device of rhetoric or textual organization, but rather denotes a widely perceived antithesis between two coherent world-views about nature.

In Problems of Genetics, Bateson lays out the dichotomy most clearly, even using the terms “external” and “innate” to contrast the Darwinian functionalism that he rejects with his own favored structuralism. This remarkable passage encapsulates the tradition of argument by relative frequency in natu­ral history. Bateson acknowledges that natural selection occurs, of course, but relegates Darwin's force to a periphery of unimportance as an arbiter among novelties generated internally. Bateson manages, in this single passage, to at­tribute both stability and variation to internal causes, and to brand selection as a secondary tinkerer upon patterns established thereby:

We may ascribe the difference either to causes external to the organisms, primarily, that is to say, to a difference in the exigencies of adaptation under natural selection; or on the other hand, we may conceive the dif­ference as due to innate distinctions in the chemical and physiological constitutions of the fixed and the variable respectively. There is truth un­doubtedly in both conceptions. If the mole were physiologically incapa­ble of producing an albino, that variety would not have come into being, and if the albino were totally incapable of getting its living it would not be able to hold its own ... I incline to the view that the variability of polymorphic forms should be regarded rather as a thing tolerated than as an element contributing directly to their chances of life; and on the other hand, that the fixity of the monomorphic forms should be looked upon not so much as a proof that natural selection controls them with a greater stringency, but rather as evidence of a natural and intrinsic stabil­ity of chemical constitution (1913, p. 28).



Bateson presents an even more striking contrast in later passages of the same book, when he develops an image for a great, if undoable, thought ex­periment — the perfectly controlled account of evolution under uniform con­ditions, unbuffeted by any of the Darwinian externalities that make real re­sults so untidy and unpredictable: “No one disputes that the adaptation of organisms to their surroundings is one of the great problems of nature, but it is not the primary problem of descent. Moreover, until the normal and undis­turbed course of descent under uniform conditions is ascertained with some exactness, it is useless to attempt a survey of the consequences of external in­terference” (1913, p. 187).

I am somehow stunned by this structuralist audacity in branding the functionalist panoply as mere “external interference” — and of imagining a formalist internal order so set and predictable that pathways of evolution might become as regular and predictable as planetary orbits, if only we could re­move all these pesky environmental influences. The impetus and sine qua non of change for Darwin becomes, for Bateson, a mere disturbance that sullies an otherwise lovely experiment.





HUGO DE VR1ES: A MOST RELUCTANT NON-DARWINIAN





Dousing the great party of 1909


It must have been a grand show. Wallace and Hooker still lived, and happily attended to present their memories and current views. Darwin's son Francis helped with arrangements; while Sir George, his most academically accomplished offspring (and Plumian Professor of Astronomy at Cambridge), con­tributed an article on “The Genesis of Double Stars.” Charles Darwin (just plain Charles, for Victoria never did grant him a knighthood) had the good sense to publish his greatest work at age 50 — and the centenary of his birth therefore coincided with the 50th anniversary of the Origin. A grand occa­sion for a double celebration.

Cambridge University Press, at Darwin's alma mater, published the proceedings of his centennial party without delay in the right year of 1909, under the editorship of botanist A. C. Seward. The choice of participants had been ecumenical, ranging in profession from the great anthropologist J. G. Frazer (of The Golden Bough) to the equally celebrated historian J. B. Bury, and in attitude from such Darwinian stalwarts as Hooker and Weismann to such ac­tive opponents as William Bateson. All participants had their say and deliv­ered both their praises and their criticisms. In this medley of maximal diver­sity, however, only one statement seemed so egregious to the editor that he felt compelled to make a public statement.

In his short preface, editor Seward acknowledged the pluralism of his vol­ume in expressing “the divergence of views among biologists in regard to the origin of species” (1909, p. vii). Then, in a single sour note, he cried “foul” about one passage: “In regard to the interpretation of a passage in the Origin of Species quoted on page 71, it seemed advisable to add an editorial foot­note; but, with this exception, I have not felt it necessary to record any opin­ion on views stated in these essays” (Seward, 1909, p. v).

Turning to page 71, we find ourselves in the midst of an article on “Varia­tion” by the Dutch botanist Hugo de Vries (following Weismann and preced­ing Bateson in a fascinating bridge between opposites). De Vries had won widespread fame for his “Mutation Theory” on the origin of species (2-vol-ume German edition in 1901 and 1903; English translation in 1909). Most biologists viewed this saltational proposal (correctly so, I shall argue) as anti-Darwinian in mechanism. Yet de Vries persisted in trying to cover himself with the mantle of Darwin's presumed (though posthumous) approval. In the offending passage, de Vries twisted both logic and literary interpretation to argue that Darwin had really meant to identify saltational variation as the source of evolutionary change — whereas plain sense and everyone else's reading indicated that Darwin had favored insensible variation and rejected sports. De Vries wrote:

Returning to the variations, which afford the material for . . . natural selection, we may distinguish two main kinds… Certain variations constantly occur, especially such as are connected with size, weight, color, etc. They are usually too small for natural selection to act upon, having hardly any influence in the struggle for life: others are more rare, occur­ring only from time to time, perhaps once or twice in a century, perhaps even only once in a thousand years. Moreover, these are of another type, not simply affecting size, number or weight, but bringing about some­thing new, which may be useful or not. ... In his criticism of miscellaneous objections brought forward against the theory of natural selection after the publication of the first edition of the Origin of Species, Darwin stated his view on this point very clearly: — “The doctrine of natural se­lection or the survival of the fittest, which implies when variations or in­dividual differences of a beneficial nature happen to arise, these will be preserved.” In this sense the words “happen to arise” appear to me of prominent significance. ... A distinction is indicated between ordinary fluctuations which are always present, and such variations as “happen to arise” from time to time. The latter afford the material for natural selec­tion to act upon on the broad lines of organic development, but the first do not. Fortuitous variations are the species producing kind, which the theory requires; continuous fluctuations constitute, in this respect, a use­less type... Darwin's variations, which from time to time happen to arise, are mutations, the opposite type being commonly designed fluctua­tions (de Vries, 1909b, pp. 70-72).



Seward responded in his unique footnote, and with annoyance barely concealed:

I think it right to point out that the interpretation of this passage from the Origin by Prof. De Vries is not accepted as correct either by Mr. Fran­cis Darwin or by myself. We do not believe that Darwin intended to draw any distinction between two types of variation; the words 'when variations or individual differences of a beneficial nature happen to arise' are not in our opinion meant to imply a distinction between ordinary fluctuations and variations, which 'happen to arise.'... The statement in this passage that 'Darwin was well aware that ordinary variability has nothing to do with evolution, but that other kinds of variation were nec­essary' is contradicted by many passages in the Origin (Seward, 1909, p. 71).



Why did de Vries so covet a linkage with Darwin that he would torture and distort his hero's words to forge the supposed bond? And why did Seward single out this passage among others more overtly hostile to the source of this centennial celebration? To resolve this small puzzle, we must explore the wider context of de Vries' background and purposes. In particular, we must rescue de Vries from his conventional “sound bite” status as “Mendel's rediscoverer,” and recognize this near accident in his career as distinctly secondary to a much deeper, older, and direct inspiration from Darwin. We shall see that the profundity of de Vries' intellectual break with Darwin, combined with his psychological inability to sever overt homage, set the deeper source of Seward's legitimate annoyance about a single passage. An understanding of de Vries' reluctant apostasy provides our best biographically based insight into the nature of Darwinian logic — and of the persistent power and attrac­tion of formalist alternatives (stressing the facet-flipping mode of Galton's polyhedron in this case).





The (not so contradictory) sources of the mutation theory


Hugo de Vries became the world's most celebrated evolutionist during the early 20th century. His Mutationstheorie received wide approbation as the most important proposal about evolutionary mechanisms since the Origin of Species and the theory of natural selection. He made three triumphant visits to the United States (in 1904, 1906, and 1912) and published two books in English (de Vries, 1905,1907a) based on summer lectures at the University of California, Berkeley. His views therefore became especially well known to American and other English-speaking audiences. All professionals continue to recognize his name today, but his ideas have suffered a nearly total eclipse for two major reasons, one legitimate and one unfair.

For the legitimate source, de Vries chose an unfortunate research strategy — a botanical equivalent of putting all his eggs in one basket. His theory — based largely on results from a single species, the evening primrose Oenothera Lamarckiana — requires that his chosen exemplar represent a biological norm in order to grant the required generality to his proposed mechanism. But the “species forming” saltations of Oenothera were soon revealed as oddities of an unusual chromosomal system, for Oenothera Lamarckiana is a permanent heterozygote, a hybrid with chromosomes of each component linked in rings, and thus segregating together in meiosis. (Only half the seeds are viable, be­cause both homozygotes are lethal.)

For the unfair reason, de Vries has been so identified with an almost accidental moment of enduring fame that we have lost the main thrust and ratio­nale of his life's work. Such moments often inspire catechistic one-liners that persist as the instant legacy of great thinkers. De Vries has suffered even more than most scholars caught in such a predicament, for he became the subject of two knee-jerk catechisms:

1. Mendel's forgotten work of 1865 was independently rediscovered in 1900 by Hugo de Vries, Carl Correns, and Erich Tschermak-Seysenegg.

2. Ironically, the first application of Mendelism to evolutionary theory did not help to affirm Darwinism, but to assert yet another alternative mecha­nism of change — the saltatory origin of new species by macromutation. The Modern Synthesis, the true fusion of Darwin and Mendel, began two decades later when scientists finally realized that small-scale (Darwinian) variation could also claim a particulate basis, and that macromutations played no im­portant role in evolution. We may praise de Vries as a rediscoverer of Mendel, but his own interpretation of particulate inheritance delayed a proper reso­lution.

Neither of these conventional accounts can be dismissed as false, but nei­ther properly expresses the reasons for de Vries' interests and discoveries. His link with Mendel represents a relatively minor encounter en passant in a ca­reer dedicated to other concerns. De Vries did discover the Mendelian segre­gation laws during the 1890's, and he did demonstrate their occurrence in some 20 species. As he prepared to publish this work in early 1900, his col­league, Professor Beyerinck at Delft, sent him an old paper with the following note: “I know that you are studying hybrids, so perhaps the enclosed reprint of the year 1865 by a certain Mendel, which I happen to possess, is still of some interest to you” (quoted in Stomps, 1954 — Stomps succeeded de Vries as professor of botany in Amsterdam). De Vries therefore reported Mendel's forgotten priority as he began to publish his results in 1900.

The link to Mendel, while surely true, must be labeled as unfair when cited as an exclusive epitome of de Vries' career. Discovery of the segregation laws did excite him, but this work represented only a sidelight to his major inter­est. Most early studies based on the Mendelian rediscovery did oppose Dar­winism at first, but the deep irony of de Vries's contribution lies in the fact that he had taken up the study of heredity as a direct consequence of his con­cern — indeed, in his own words, his “love” — for Darwin as a man and a scholar. Darwin's theory of pangenesis (Darwin, 1868) served as de Vries' in­spiration — and de Vries' first major book (his best in the judgment of many distinguished biologists, both then and now) presented a brilliant reformula­tion of Darwin's insight (Intracellular Pangenesis, de Vries, 1889).

De Vries turned to the study of heredity in order to probe the mechanisms of evolution. But he never considered the Mendelian segregation laws as par­ticularly relevant to this goal — for these principles only regulated the distri­bution of characters by hybridization among differing phenotypes, whereas evolution required the origin of new variation. De Vries did not continue his work on Mendel's principles, and his two great books on evolution (de Vries, 1905 and 1909a) cite Mendel only rarely, and only in contexts peripheral to his main arguments about saltation and evolutionary novelty. De Vries's biog­rapher van der Pas rightly comments (1970, p. 99): “After the rediscovery of Mendel's laws, many investigators took up the subject. De Vries was not among them, however. He believed that hybridization only causes redistribu­tion of existing characters and for that reason cannot explain the appearance of new species. Therefore, he concentrated on the phenomenon of mutation, which he believed explained the origin of new species and therefore gave nec­essary support to the theory of evolution.”

If Mendel only represented a sidelight in de Vries's career, two main sources stand out as inspirations for his interests and strategies — his teacher Julius Sachs and his mentor and guru Charles Darwin. De Vries' long life (1848-1935) spanned the years from Darwin to Dobzhansky. Unhappy with the quality of his initial botanical education in the Netherlands, de Vries decided, in the early 1870's, to continue his studies in Germany. Beginning in 1871, while teaching in an Amsterdam secondary school, de Vries began spending his long summer vacations in the laboratory of the leading plant physiologist, Julius Sachs. De Vries wrote a series of monographs and performed elegant experiments on osmosis in plant cells, the basis for his later work on the role of cellular turgor in the motions of growing plants. Sachs considered de Vries as his best student and helped to secure for him the first instructorship in plant physiology in the Netherlands, when the Amsterdam Athenaeum be­came a full university in 1877. De Vries later served as professor of botany and taught at Amsterdam until his retirement in 1918, though he remained professionally active until his death, working from an experimental garden and laboratory that he built in the remote village of Lunteren.

Through the 1870's, de Vries worked exclusively on problems in mechani­cal and chemical physiology. But, in the early 1880's, inspired directly by Darwin, he began to shift his interests to evolution and heredity. From 1885 to 1887, he published a series of 19 articles on “improving races of our culti­vated plants” for a Dutch agricultural journal. He first found mutations of Oenothera in 1886, and worked steadily on his evolutionary views until his major work, Die Mutationstheorie appeared in two volumes in 1901 and 1903 (the Mendelian rediscovery only occurred as the book neared comple­tion and could not have inspired much of de Vries' conceptual apparatus). De Vries credited his Intracellular Pangenesis of 1889 as the source of his theo­retical views on evolution. By 1890, he had abandoned work in physiology, and he then spent the rest of his career as a student of evolution and heredity.

From Sachs and his colleagues, de Vries absorbed the leading philosophical tenets of late 19th century German science, then the envy and model of the Western world — experimentalism and the mechanical worldview. Through­out his later career in evolutionary biology, de Vries insisted that his success derived from his attempt to substitute an active, experimental and quantita­tive methodology for the older comparative and descriptive approaches of natural history.

In the frontispiece of his first American book (1905), de Vries shunned humility and ranked himself, by virtue of his experimentalism, at the pinnacle of progress in the history of evolutionary studies. (The Mutation Theory did not appear in English translation until 1909, and these published Berkeley lec­tures therefore represent the first extensive account of de Vries' views in Eng­lish. Intracellular Pangenesis first appeared in English translation in 1910.) De Vries wrote:

The origin of species is a natural phenomenon — Lamarck.

The origin of species is an object of inquiry — Darwin.

The origin of species is an object of experimental investigation — de Vries (1905, frontispiece).



De Vries' rhetorical expression of this theme in his major work (1909a translation of 1901 German edition) follows an interesting course — self-serv­ing to be sure, but revealing. Failure to progress in evolutionary studies, he argues, may be attributed to an antiquated methodology: “We have a doc­trine of descent resting on a morphological foundation. The time has come to erect one on an experimental basis” (1909a, volume 1, p. 207). (De Vries maintained a generous view of the experimental domain — for he usually ap­plied the term to the rigorous recording of well-tracked pedigrees in garden plots, rather than to more classical manipulation in sterilized buildings under controlled conditions. He wrote (1905, p. 463): “The exact methods of the laboratory must be used, and in this case the garden is the laboratory.”)

De Vries then extended his argument in two directions from this central methodological premise. First, to gain broadest generality in aligning evolu­tionary studies with physical sciences of higher status, de Vries opens The Mutation Theory with a claim that theories based on discrete, atomized parti­cles suggest better experiments than hypotheses about continua. Moreover, such theories can also ally biology with more prestigious fields like chemistry: “By the mutation theory I mean the proposition that the attributes of organ­isms consist of distinct, separate and independent units. These units can be associated in groups and we find, in allied species, the same units and groups of units. Transitions, such as we so frequently meet with in the external form, both of animals and plants, are as completely absent between these units as they are between the molecules of the chemist” (1909a, volume 1, p. 3). He then expressed the same argument more strongly in a popular article (1907b, p. 17): “This principle of mutations is conducive to the assumption of distinct units in the characters of plants and animals. Even as chemistry has reached its present high development chiefly through the assumption of atoms and molecules as definite units, the qualities of which would be measurable and could be expressed in figures, in the same way systematic botany and the al­lied comparative studies are in need of a basis for measurement and calcula­tions.”

Second, and in an odd conflation of proper methodology and empirical truth-value, de Vries argues in his Preface that Darwinian gradualism should be rejected (or at least strongly disfavored a priori) because insensible change over millennia cannot easily become the subject of experiment!

The origin of species has so far been the object of comparative studies only. It is generally believed that this highly important phenomenon does not lend itself to direct observation, and, much less, to experimental investigation. This belief has its root in the prevalent form of the conception of species and in the opinion that the species of animals and plants have originated by imperceptible gradations. These changes are indeed believed to be so slow that the life of a man is not long enough to enable him to witness the origin of a new form. The object of the present book is to show that species arise by saltations and that the individual saltations are occurrences which can be observed like any other physiological process ... In this way we may hope to realize the possibility of elucidat­ing, by experiment, the laws to which the origin of new species conform (1909a, volume 1, p. vii).



With such negativity towards the methodology and worldview of natural selection and gradualism, how could Charles Darwin serve de Vries as chief intellectual guru, even surpassing the influence of Sachs and experimental-ism? We cannot grasp de Vries' convictions and contradictions until we un­derstand the powerful extent and threefold nature of Darwin's largely psy­chological hold upon him.

First of all, we often forget the extent of Darwin's work on plant physiol­ogy — largely published during the 1870's as de Vries began his career, and primarily in the same areas, particularly the proximate causes of movement, that most interested de Vries. Darwin wrote books on Insectivorous Plants (1875a), The Movement and Habits of Climbing Plants (1875b), and The Power of Movement in Plants (1880a). In these technical studies, the two men could not have stood closer as intellectual colleagues — even though their enduring fame would arise elsewhere, from their disparate studies of evolu­tion.

Second, de Vries directly courted and won Darwin's admiration and friendship. The two men exchanged extensive correspondence (reprinted in Van der Pas, 1970). Darwin extended much effort to help de Vries. He sent complimentary copies of his books to de Vries, and he wrote to Asa Gray for seeds, so that de Vries could pursue some experiments on movement in tendrils. De Vries, for his part, repeated and extended many of Darwin's experiments on the physiological basis of movement and insectivory in several species. For example, de Vries wrote to Darwin on December 8, 1880:

I am very much obliged to you for your great kindness of sending me your work on the Power of Movement in Plants ... I was especially in­terested by your experiments on the movements and the curious sensi­tiveness of the roots and plumules of young seedling plants, which I hope to repeat as soon as I shall have an occasion ... I always remember the great pleasure I had in repeating the experiments, described in your work on insectivorous plants.... In your work, you often speak of my papers, . . . and I am much indebted to you for your kind judgment of them, which will be a stimulus to me in endeavoring to contribute my part to the advancement of science.



In the summer of 1878, just before promotion to his Amsterdam professorship, de Vries visited England and fulfilled his fondest hope of meeting Dar­win. He first called on Hooker and Thistleton-Dyer in London, but found them cool, however kind and correct. By contrast, de Vries greatly enjoyed a memorable, if short, visit with Darwin at Dorking, the home of Darwin's brother-in-law, Sir Thomas H. Farrer. De Vries described this visit in a charm­ing letter to his fiancee on August 14, 1878:

Today I have visited Darwin; I am happy that it happened and I must say that Darwin was so very cordial and friendly . . . The conversation was quite easy; they all spoke very slowly and clearly and they gave me the time to speak up; thus I did better in speaking English than I expected ... In the garden there were hothouses with peaches and grapes. Darwin told me a long story about the peaches and immediately offered me one of them; it was delicious.

During our scientific conversation, there was the same laughing mania as you have seen with Sachs; Sachs laughs all the time, Darwin some­what less but as merrily. He was very interested in what I have done lately...

He puts a footstool on a chair before he sits down on it, for he gets headaches if he sits low — the poor soul! Mr. Farrer told me that today Darwin felt exceptionally well and happy and that I were lucky. Mrs. Darwin takes good care of him and will never allow him to become too tired; she simply sends him to bed!

He has deepset eyes and in addition very protruding eyebrows, much more than one would say from his portrait. He is tall and thin and has thin hands, he walks slowly and uses a cane and has to stop from time to time... His speech is very lively, merry and cordial, not too quick and very clear.

It is remarkable how soon one feels at home with people who are friendly and cordial. What a difference with Hooker and Dyer; they were cold and I did not care about them. But I enjoyed my visit with Darwin and I feel much more happy these last days. It is such a pleasure to find that somebody is really interested in you and that he cares about what you have discovered.



Third, and most importantly, Darwin also directly inspired de Vries' shift from physiological to evolutionary and genetic studies. With fond memories in old age, de Vries told an interviewer in 1925 (quoted in Van der Pas, 1970, p. 192): “I was led to the study of heredity by my love for Darwin.”

The source of de Vries' inspiration did not lie in the Origin of Species or the Descent of Man, but rather in Darwin's speculation on heredity, the “provi­sional hypothesis of pangenesis” as Darwin characterized his own proposal, published as the last chapter of his two-volume 1868 treatise on Variation in Plants and Animals Under Domestication. In his last letter to Darwin (who died six months later), de Vries wrote, up to date as ever in commenting on Darwin's last book The Formation of Vegetable Mold Through the Action of Worms, but also mentioning a stronger interest in Darwin's older views on pangenesis: “After reading the first chapter of your book, I have been attend­ing to the habits of worms, and had the good fortune of repeating some of your interesting observations . . . For some time I have been studying the causes of the variations of animals and plants, as described in your treatise ... I have always been especially interested in your hypothesis of Pangenesis and have collected a series of facts in favor of it” (de Vries to Darwin, Octo­ber 15,1881).

Darwin's hypothesis of pangenesis served as a speculation that could val­idate Lamarckian inheritance, a mode of transmission that Darwin deem-phasized but did not contest. According to pangenesis, the basis of hereditary characters resides within tiny cellular particles called gemmules. All cells pro­duce gemmules during growth and later life. Gemmules then migrate from so­matic to germ cells, where they collect to pass inherited characters to the next generation. The germ cells therefore store “actual physical representatives of all the cells which have existed during the whole life of the parent body” (Kellogg, 1907, p. 218). Since gemmules become modified in somatic cells by conditions of life and the actions of organisms, acquired characters can be in­herited.

De Vries suggested a fundamental (and correct) modification that turned Darwin's theory into something quite different. He abandoned Darwin's key notion of the migration of gemmules across cell boundaries — thus removing the rationale for Lamarckian inheritance. In de Vries' revised concept, the hy­pothesized hereditary particles behaved so differently that they required a dif­ferent name; thus, still honoring Darwin, de Vries rechristened the gemmules as “pangenes.”

In de Vries' concept of Intracellular Pangenesis (the title of his 1889 book), the nucleus of each cell contains all particles (pangenes) needed to construct an organism. But only some pangenes are expressed in each cell, thus explain­ing the differential morphogenesis of parts. Expressed pangenes migrate out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where they orchestrate the appropriate em­bryology. In no case can pangenes move between cells. De Vries wrote: “The hypothesis that all living protoplasm is built up of pangenes, I call intra­cellular pangenesis. In the nucleus every kind of pangene of the given individ­ual is represented; the remaining protoplasm in every cell contains chiefly only those that ought to become active in it” (1889, in 1910 translation, p. 215).

This remarkably prescient theory comes as close to the secret of heredity as anyone had managed in the speculative tradition before the elucidation of genes and chromosomes. Whiggish historians nearly always regard Intra­cellular Pangenesis as de Vries' greatest book. In abstract concept, his nuclear pangenes differ little from the particles of heredity that would soon be recog­nized and named as genes, especially since de Vries viewed his pangenes as a minimal set of basic instructions, not naively as a collection of items for speci­fying each overt phenotypic part. His notion of active and latent pangenes re­calls dominant and recessive alleles — and one might justly argue that de Vries had therefore been “preadapted” to appreciate Mendel. Fortune, as Pasteur famously said, favors the prepared mind. Moreover, the notion that all in­structions reside in the nucleus (with passage to the cytoplasm, at appropriate times and places, for transmission of local messages) bears remarkable iso­morphism with our modern mechanism of DNA, RNA, and the differentia­tion of cells.

Two further aspects of Intracellular Pangenesis play important roles in this story. First, de Vries' theory became the source of our modern term “gene” — for Johannsen explicitly derived the shortened name directly from de Vries' “pangene.” Moreover, since de Vries' “pangene” honored Darwin's name for his speculative particle of heredity, Darwin himself becomes the ultimate source (via de Vries) for this basic biological term. Few evolutionary biolo­gists recognize this curious terminological odyssey, making Darwin himself the ultimate, if indirect, source of our modern term “gene.”

Second, we note in de Vries' treatment of Darwin a microcosm of the strange and almost painfully ambivalent fealty that tied him emotionally (and verbally) to Darwin even while he devised a contradictory theory — the source of Seward's anger, as described in my opening remarks. De Vries' theory, despite its personal source in Darwin's pangenesis, became a fundamentally different intellectual entity. In Darwin's pangenesis, gemmules move from somatic to germ cells and provide a mechanism for Lamarckian inheri­tance. In de Vries' intracellular pangenesis, pangenes move from the nucleus to the cytoplasm of the same cell and specify a theory of cellular differentia­tion.

Yet de Vries insisted on downplaying this difference as a minor variation. For rhetorical purposes, he asserted that his denial of intercellular movement for gemmules constituted only a minor reform in Darwin's ideas. His new theory could therefore remain entirely in Darwin's spirit. Throughout his life, de Vries could not break verbal fealty with the primary hero and inspiration of his youth. In a late work of 1922, de Vries wrote:

Freed from the assumption of a transportation of gemmules through the organism, the conception of Pangenesis is the clear basis of the present manifold theories of heredity. An organic being is a microcosm, says Darwin, a little universe, formed of a host of self-propagating organisms, inconceivably minute, and numerous as the stars of heaven. In honor of Darwin, I have proposed to call these minute organisms Pangenes, and this name has now been generally accepted under the shortened form of genes. They are assumed to be the material bearers of the unit characters of species and varieties (1922, p. 222).





The mutation theory: origin and central tenets


Evolutionists usually assume that, since de Vries ranks within the trio of Men­del's resurrectionists, his “mutation theory” — with its genetic title and de­served status as the greatest challenge to Darwinism from the early 20th cen­tury — must be traceable to a Mendelian inspiration. But de Vries always insisted that his theory, and almost everything else he valued, could boast a Darwinian source. In particular, he asserted later in his career that the root of the Mutation Theory lay in an insight about two distinctly different kinds of variation that he had obtained from Darwin's theory of pangenesis, and then developed within his own Intracellular Pangenesis of 1889. I am not con­fident that this link can be defended, for considerable (and rather tortured) exegesis must be applied to so interpret the actual text of de Vries' 1889 book, whatever his later memories. But de Vries' debt and psychological fe­alty to Darwin can only be called pervasive, while the timing of de Vries' in­terpretation can also be defended (for the Mendelian discovery postdated the genesis of the mutation theory).

In the English version (1910) of Intracellular Pangenesis, de Vries wrote a note to his translator, pointing to a passage that he identified as the source of the Mutation Theory: “An altered numerical relation of the pangenes already present, and the formation of new kinds of pangenes must form the two main factors of variability” (1910, p. 74). De Vries interpreted this passage as pres­aging the key claim of his later mutation theory — that new species arise suddenly by a distinct and special kind of saltational variation (called muta­tion), while ordinary, imperceptible, omnipresent, Darwinian variability can­not forge evolutionary novelties. Late in his career, de Vries wrote (1922, p. 222): “Species and varieties have originated by mutation, but are, at pres­ent, not known to have originated in any other way. Originally this concep­tion has been derived from the hypothesis of unit characters as deduced from Darwin's Pangenesis, which led to the expectation of two different kinds of variability, one slow and one sudden.”

Whatever the intellectual roots, de Vries eventually centered his illustration and defense of the mutation theory upon a single source, the evening prim­rose, Oenothera Lamarckiana — so we can identify a particular empirical ba­sis for the defense of his views. (This strategy, as mentioned previously, ulti­mately backfired when researchers explained the unusual mutability in O. Lamarckiana as a peculiarity of the plant's hybrid nature and chromosomal system, and not as the generality that de Vries required.) In 1886, de Vries found odd and distinct mutational variations growing among a wild field of evening primroses at Hilversum, near Amsterdam. He later described his mix­ture of good fortune and conscious preparation (1905, p. 27):

Cultivated plants of course, had only a small chance to exhibit new qualities, as they have been so strictly controlled during so many years. Moreover, their purity of origin is in many cases doubtful... For this reason I have limited myself to the trial of wild plants of Holland, and have had the good fortune to find among them at least one species in a state of mutability. It was not really a native plant, but one probably in­troduced from America or at least belonging to an American genus. It was the great evening primrose or the primrose of Lamarck. A strain of this beautiful species is growing on an abandoned field in the vicinity of Hilversum, at a short distance from Amsterdam. Here it has escaped from a park and multiplied. In doing so it has produced, and is still pro­ducing quite a number of new types . . . This interesting plant has af­forded me the means of observing directly how new species originate, and of studying the laws of these changes.



De Vries' method for finding and propagating Oenothera mutants included a mixture of experimental care and hard work in the Burbankian mode. To find new mutants, he sowed prodigious numbers of seeds. For example, in his 1888 sowing, he tested 15,000 seedlings and found 10 mutations. To propa­gate and breed his new forms, and to test for their purity in inheritance, de Vries stringently followed the obvious rules for tracing pedigrees: fertilize each plant with known pollen, prevent insect pollination, save and sow all seeds separately.

De Vries, in crisp summary, presented the essence of his theory as exhibited by the Oenothera mutants — sudden, fully constituted, nonadaptive, observ­able, experimentally ascertainable origin of new species: “They came into ex­istence at once, fully equipped, without preparation or intermediate steps. No series of generations, no selection, no struggle for existence was needed. It was a sudden leap into another type, a sport in the best acceptation of the word. It fulfilled my hopes, and at once gave proof of the possibility of the direct observation of the origin of species, and of the experimental control thereof” (1905, p. 550).

De Vries reported different numbers and names for new Oenothera species in various publications, but the seven cited in his 1904 Berkeley lectures pro­vide a good feel for his categories and criteria (see Fig. 5-9). Above all, the mutants appeared suddenly and bred true (other mutants reverted, hybrid­ized, or segregated in only a proportion of progeny). De Vries placed his seven new species into three categories. First, he designated two “true elemen­tary species” — the red-veined O. rubrinervis and the giant O. gigas (a tetra-ploid by later discovery). De Vries described these new forms as “robust and stark species, which seem to be equal in vigor to the parent plant, while di­verging from it in striking characters” (1905, p. 533). In a second category of “retrograde varieties,” de Vries identified the smooth-leaved O. laevifolia, the short-styled O. brevistylis, and the dwarf O. nanella, “a most attractive little plant” (1905, p. 531). These new forms also arose with abrupt distinctness, and bred as true as the two “elementary species,” but these three mutants dif­fered from the parent O. Lamarckiana by loss or diminution of an ancestral character, not by addition of novelty — hence their separate, and less admira­ble, category. (I am intrigued by our cultural bias that designates increased bulk as a novelty (O. gigas), while ranking shortness as mere subtraction (O. nanella).) De Vries then placed two forms into a third (and inconsequential) class of “weak species” that “have no manifest chance of self-maintenance in the wild state” (1905, p. 537). The whitish O. albida “grows too slowly and is overgrown,” while the oblong-leaved O. oblongata “bear small fruits and few seeds.”

All three central tenets of the mutation theory work in direct opposition to Darwinian gradualism and sequential shaping by natural selection in the ori­gin of species — hence the widespread and proper interpretation of de Vries' theory as a powerful refutation of Darwinism (Kellogg, 1907, who lists the views of de Vries as an alternative, not an auxiliary, to Darwinism).

1. Above all, the mutation theory embodies the most unabashedly saltational notion ever seriously regarded as an evolutionary mechanism. New species arise in a single step by a sudden, discontinuous, fully formed and true breeding leap in phenotype. De Vries could not have been clearer in his intro­ductory comment to the Mutation Theory (1909a, p. 3): “Species have arisen from one another by a discontinuous, as opposed to a continuous process. Each new unit, forming a fresh step in this process, sharply and completely separates the new form as an independent species from that from which it sprang. The new species appears all at once; it originates from the parent spe­cies without any visible preparation and without any obvious series of transi­tional forms.”

De Vries explicitly contrasts his new view with Darwinian gradualism: “A current belief assumes that species are slowly changed into new types. In con­tradiction to this conception the theory of mutation assumes that new species and varieties are produced from existing forms by sudden leaps” (1905, p. vii). Such sudden inception precludes any role for natural selection in the origin of species. Taking the traditional anti-Darwinian line, and employing a striking metaphor, de Vries claims that selection cannot construct anything new, but can only operate as a sieve to preserve favorable forms produced by some other process: “Natural selection is a sieve. It creates nothing, as is so often assumed; it only sifts. It retains only what variability puts into the sieve. Whence the material comes that is put into it should be kept separate from the theory of its selection. How the struggle for existence sifts is one question; how that which is sifted arose is another” (1909a, volume 2, p. 609).

2. If new species originate in single leaps, then their origin must be non-adaptive, however much their future survival may require a fortuitous match with local environments: “It explains in a very simple way the existence of the vast number of specific characters which are quite useless or as to the use of which we have no idea at all... According to the commonly accepted theory of selection only characters advantageous to their possessors should arise; according

to the theory of mutation on the other hand useless or even disadvan­tageous ones may also appear” (1909a, volume 1, pp. 209-210)

3. Slow Darwinian changes cannot be observed on human and experimen­tal time scales, but the mutation theory brings evolution into the domain of observational science; “the origin of species may be seen as easily as any other phenomenon” (1905, p. 26). Emphasizing a direct contrast between the vir­tues of his operational theory and the fatal intractability of Darwinian gradu­alism (here attributed to Wallace, for de Vries could not bear to saddle his hero with such a negative assessment), de Vries brands gradualism as obstruc­tionist, and compliments his own view as liberating: “I shall try to prove that sudden mutation is the normal way in which nature produces new species and new varieties. These mutations are more readily accessible to observation and experiment than the slow and gradual changes surmised by Wallace and his followers, which are entirely beyond our present and future experience.

The rest of the diagram illustrates De Vries' gen­eral view of evolution; with most lineages stable nearly all the time, but entering short mutational episodes when several new species may arise virtually at the same time. From Volume 2 of De Vries' Mutation Theory.





The theory of mutations is a starting point for direct investigation while the general belief in slow changes has held back science from such investigations during half a century” (1905, p. 30).

As an experimental reductionist, committed to finding the mechanism for large-scale evolution of phenotypes in the smallest cellular parts, de Vries sought the causal basis for his mutation theory in the character of variation and its putative causes. As a foundation for all his theorizing, de Vries pro­posed a strict separation between two distinct types of variation: fluctuating and mutational. (This division, of course, establishes the same false dichot­omy that prompted the famous “biometrician” vs. “Mendelian” debate — a struggle that de Vries' context did much to promote). De Vries stated that, in the early 1870's, he had read Quetelet's work on normal curves and Galtonian regression to the mean — and had determined thereby that the om­nipresent, small scale or, in his favored term, “fluctuating” variation could not be parlayed into directional evolutionary change, as Darwin's theory re­quired (Fig. 5-10). Evolution must therefore require a conceptually and caus­ally distinct mode of sudden, larger-scale, true breeding and non-regressing variation — a necessary source eventually found in the “mutations” that yielded distinct new phenotypes in Oenothera.

De Vries acknowledged that selection of fluctuating variation could pro­duce new agricultural races and stocks of domesticated animals. But this Dar­winian alteration can only yield a minor change from the mean of a parental stock: “It is responsible only for the smallest lateral branches of the pedigree, but has nothing in common with the evolution of the main stems. It is of very subordinate importance” (1905, p. 801). These new races, if not constantly superintended, will rapidly revert towards parental characters by regression to the mean (1909a, volume 1, pp. 88-89). De Vries, who understood the logic of Darwinism so keenly (see pp. 446–451), knew that the most promising

Darwinian escape from this paradox lay in a claim that fluctuating varia­tion would be reconstituted symmetrically about a newly established mean — and that continual, directional selection to great cumulative effect could therefore be achieved. De Vries, following the classic argument about a “rigid sphere” of variation, as famously formulated by Fleeming Jenkin (1867), sim­ply denied that such reconstitution could occur. Again, using Wallace as Dar­win's surrogate, de Vries stated (1909a, volume 1, p. 42): “I admit that with this assumption [of limitless and reconstitutable variation] it would be very easy and simple to account for the phenomenon of adaptation ... If [Wallace's] assumption is once granted everything follows. But it is, as a mat­ter of fact, fallacious.”

De Vries summarized his views on the inefficacy of fluctuating variation (which, he suspected, did not have a particulate Mendelian basis and arose by influences that we would now call ecophenotypic). How could substantial and permanent evolutionary change originate from a style of variation that (1) always regressed toward the mean; (2) arose in strictly limited extent, with preponderance near the mean, and only rarely at a useful phenotypic difference (the normal curve); (3) enjoined a strictly linear set of effects, only producing more or less of a feature, while “creative” evolution required the development of true novelty: “Individual variability, when tested by sowing, reverts to its original mean, the forms of its variants are connected together, are coherent and not discontinuous. It is centripetal in as much as the varia­tions are grouped most densely around a mean. Finally — and this is very im­portant — it is linear; because the deviations occur in only two directions — less or more.”

By default therefore, but not at all as a negative argument, evolutionary novelty must arise by a phenomenologically and causally distinct style of variation that de Vries called “mutational” — i.e., sudden, fortuitous (and therefore nonadaptive), true breeding and nonreverting saltations. De Vries called these saltational variants “species,” but we must understand (as he did) that such units cannot be equated with traditional Linnaean taxa of the same name. With his mutation theory, de Vries entered (and largely shaped, though he did not originate) a major debate in systematics.

Obviously, a de Vriesian saltation does not, in se, make a new species in our usual sense of the term — for the single mutant plant is only an individual with a discontinuous phenotype, however true breeding in self-fertilization. In what sense, then, could de Vries insist that he had discovered the mechanism for the origin of new species?

In large part, de Vries based his claim upon an attempted redefinition. He argued that the traditional Linnaean species encompasses an imprecise, compound aggregation including varying numbers of phenotypically distinct, true-breeding entities (and a fair amount of continuous variability as well, based on the fluctuating style). The true-breeding subtypes represent nature's genuine units and should be so designated. They arise by discontinuous salta­tion, without intermediates, and should be called “elementary species.” As a practical point, de Vries did not propose that all traditional taxonomy be restructured. He would allow the Linnaean names to persist as “species,” with his smaller, “real” units termed “elementary species.” (De Vries did not fol­low his own recommendation consistently, for he gave new species names, in traditional Linnaean form, to his mutational variants. For example, the large tetraploid became Oenothera gigas derived from O. Lamarckiana). In this ar­gument, de Vries supported a movement, then current in systematics, to des­ignate the traditional Linnaean units as linneons and the true-breeding sub­types as jordanons (to honor the botanist Alexis Jordan) — recognizing both as species of different sorts and by different criteria (with the jordanon as “more” biological and the linneon as tolerated by practical necessity). De Vries wrote:

We may conclude that systematic species, as they are accepted nowa­days, are as a rule compound groups. Sometimes they consist of two or three, or a few, elementary types, but in other cases they comprise 20, or 50, or even hundreds of constant and well-differentiated forms (1905, p. 38).

The systematic species are the practical units of the systematists and florists, and all friends of wild nature should do their utmost to preserve them as Linnaeus has proposed them. These units, however, do not re­ally exist entities; they have as little claim to be regarded as such as the genera and families have. The real units are the elementary species ... Pedigree culture is the method required and any form which remains constant and distinct from its allies in the garden is to be considered as an elementary species (1905, p. 12).



De Vries' historical argument for changing emphasis from the linneon (or­dinary species) to the jordanon (de Vriesian elementary species) provides an interesting insight into his worldview and rhetorical style. Before Linnaeus, he claims, genera stood as the “natural” units of common discourse: “The old vulgar names of plants, such as roses and clover, poplars and oaks, nearly all refer to genera” (1905, p. 33). Linnaeus, also searching for the natural unit, failed to extend his argument far enough. He began with genera and then moved “down” to species. He knew that he might proceed to still smaller units, but chose to go no further:

Afterwards Linnaeus changed his opinion on this important point, and adopted species as the units of the system. He declared them to be the created forms, and by this decree at once reduced the genera to the rank of artificial groups. Linnaeus was well aware that this conception was wholly arbitrary, and that even the species are not real indivisible enti­ties. But he simply forbade the study of lesser subdivisions. At this time, he was quite justified in doing so, because the first task of the systematic botanists was the clearing up of the chaos of forms and the bringing of them in connection with their real allies (1905, p. 34).



Just as the establishment of Linnaean species had made genera artificial, so too does the recognition of de Vriesian elementary species relegate the con­ventional Linnaean species to a congeries with no natural status. De Vries ar­gues that this theoretical progress from larger to successively smaller units of natural “reality” illustrates the general advance of science as a reductionistic enterprise. A “stepping down” from the Linnaean species to the de Vriesian elementary species can claim both the sanction of history and the virtue of utility: “What is to guide us in the choice of the material? The answer may only be expected from a consideration of elementary species. For it is obvious that they only can be observed to originate, and that the systematic species, because they are only artificial groups of lower unities, can never become the subject of successful experimental inquiry” (1905, p. 517).

This redefinition of species as discontinuous saltations inevitably raised the issue of whether de Vries' new units (“elementary species,” or “jordanons” of other terminologies) always originated from single monophyletic sources, or represented discrete phenotypes that could arise more than once — thus di­vorcing this supposedly “most real” taxon from the usual genealogical crite­rion of monophyly for a basic unit in a phylogenetic system. De Vries, follow­ing both the logic of his argument and his observation that elementary species of Oenothera arose again and again, accepted the implication (so strange to modern “population thinking” and genealogically based taxonomy) that the same species could, and usually did, arise many times. In fact, such a propen­sity for multiple origins established a major criterion for potential success. De Vries noted as central to his concept (1909a, p. 208) “the assumption that the new form or species does not arise merely once from the parent species but ... a great many times and with some degree of regularity.”

De Vries devised an interesting set of subtypes for his saltations — thus revealing another aspect of the philosophical complexity of his ideas (not al­ways expressed with consistency, but often replete with interesting psycho­logical and sociological influences). If “stepping down” from the linneon to the jordanon revealed a reductionist bias usually interpreted as “modernist” in his time, then de Vries's classification of mutations reveals an allegiance to notions of progress and regress that might be deemed archaic in its implied fascination for the scala naturae.

De Vries recognized some of his mutations as starkly different (in a qualitative sense) from the parental form. But others could be linked in a series, with the parent as prototype, either by loss of ancestral characters or by simple quantitative alteration. All categories included equally “good” species in the causal or genetic sense — that is, equally discontinuous entities, formed sud­denly without intermediates, and true breeding under self-fertilization. But only the first category established genuine novelty in evolution; thus, only these truly different species contributed to the progress of life's history. All other categories comprised variations on parental forms (usually based on loss or diminution of characters), and could only constitute a series around the parental prototype. Therefore, in the oldest taxonomic ploy of evolutionary thought (dating to Lamarck's distinction of progressive increments from lateral branches — see Chapter 3), de Vries subdivided, by their presumed phylogenetic effect, these taxa of similar genetic status. He labelled mutations yielding phyletic novelties as “elementary species,” while phenotypic depar­tures still linked to parental morphologies became “varieties.” De Vries then made a further subdivision among varieties, distinguishing taxa formed by loss of a character (“retrograde varieties”) from those that may seem more advanced than the parent but really display nothing new (atavistic reappear­ance of characters present in closely related species, for example, or sim­ple enhancement of a character already present). De Vries wrote (1905, pp. 246-247):

There is a real difference between elementary species and varieties. The first are of equal rank, and together constitute the collective or system­atic species. The latter are usually derived from real and still existing types. Elementary species are in a sense independent of each other; while varieties are of a derivative nature . . . We have assumed that the first came into existence by the production of something new, by the acquire­ment of a character hitherto unnoticed in the line of their ancestors. On the contrary, varieties, in most cases, evidently owe their origin to the loss of an already existing character, or in other less frequent cases, to the reassumption of a quality formerly lost. Some may originate in a nega­tive way, others in a positive manner, but in both cases nothing really new is acquired.



In his most forthright statement about the differing phyletic roles of progressive and regressive mutations, de Vries then stated (1905, p. 15):

Many instances could be given to prove that progression and retrogres­sion are the two main principles of evolution at large. Hence the conclu­sion that our analysis must dissect the complicated phenomena of evolu­tion so far as to show the separate functions of these two contrasting principles. Hundreds of steps were needed to evolve the family of the or­chids, but the experimenter must take the single steps for the object of his inquiry. He finds that some are progressive and others retrogressive, and so his investigation falls under two heads, the origin of progressive characters, and the subsequent loss of the same. Progressive steps are the marks of elementary species, while retrograde varieties are distinguished by apparent losses.



The logic of de Vries' system may be sound, but he faced — as he well understood — a major empirical dilemma. He had found consistent mutations in only one lineage, the genus Oenothera, and with high frequency only in the species O. Lamarckiana. (He noted an isolated example or two in other lin­eages, particularly in a plant with the intriguing name of “peloric toad-flax,” but found no consistently mutable form besides Oenothera. He also tested other species of Oenothera, but found most immutable or, in the case of O. biennis for example, much less subject to alteration than O. Lamarckiana. In an interesting later paper (de Vries, 1915), he tried to calculate the “coef­ficient of mutation in Oenothera biennis” vs. O. Lamarckiana, concluding that the latter species showed a 6 to 10 fold increase in mutability. De Vries attributed this augmentation to a transition of one or more pangenes from stable to labile positions — a pure speculation, but again consistent with his system and logic.)

Why only one? Did such rarity mean that de Vries had only discovered an oddball, with no general message for evolution? De Vries recognized that such an inference would destroy his system, and he therefore argued that all (or at least many) species maintain potential for entering a “mutable period,” but that very few actually exist in such a state at any moment. (We know, af­ter all, that most species are stable in both current and paleontological per­spective. If all lineages were as mutable as O. Lamarckiana, we would never be able to designate Linnaean taxa, for nature would then present a con­stantly changing and unbreakable continuum, rather than a set of discrete and recognizable populations.) De Vries considered himself fortunate that he had located even one species in such a state — for if “mutable periods” consti­tute an almost incalculably tiny fraction of a species' lifespan, the probability of finding any given species in such a state at any moment becomes effectively zero. In trying to turn the tables on his adversaries, de Vries argued that the discovery of even one case presupposes a generality for extremely rare “muta­ble periods” — for if such mutability could be dismissed as simply freakish and unique, he could not have expected to encounter even a single example!

The view that it might be an isolated case, lying outside of the usual procedure of nature, can hardly be sustained. On such a supposition it would be far too rare to be disclosed by the investigation of a small num­ber of plants from a limited area. Its appearance within the limited field of inquiry of a single man would have been almost a miracle... The mutable condition ... must be a universal phenomenon, although affect­ing a small proportion of the inhabitants of any region at one time: per­haps not more than one in a hundred species, or perhaps not more than one in a thousand, or even fewer may be expected to exhibit it (1905, p. 687).



But why should a species enter a rare mutable period, and why should most species be stable nearly all the time? What triggers a transition into this exceedingly uncommon state of evolutionary promise? On this crucial point of his entire system, de Vries fell almost eerily silent, for he could offer nothing precise. He supposed (1909a, volume 1, pp. 206-207) that some external trigger of environmental change — isolation by colonization of new areas, for example — must initiate phyletic lability, but amounts and directions of muta­tion must be attributed to internal states of pangenes (1905, p. 691). He of­fered a few general words about pangenes becoming mutable, or moving to a position of high changeability, or arising de novo with such a propensity. But he still couldn't cite anything physical, or propose anything testable. De Vries' distress and unease about this crucial subject even inspired a rare burst of almost religious romanticism, an odd rhetorical strategy (and smokescreen) for such a severe rationalist: “The view of permanency represents life as being surrounded with unavoidable death, the principle of periodicity follows in the same way the idea of resurrection, granting the possibility of future pro­gression for all living beings. At the same time it yields a more hopeful pros­pect for experimental inquiry” (1905, p. 693).

The complexities, interrelationships (in some cases amounting to near contradictions) and comprehensive character of ideas at the core of de Vries' mutation theory may best be illustrated by his attempt to epitomize his system as a set of seven laws (1905, pp. 558-571, 578). Note particularly the tug of war (both logical and psychological) between his understanding that the the­ory refutes Darwinian principles on one hand, and his desire, on the other hand, to retain fealty with Darwin as a personal hero.

1. “New elementary species appear suddenly, without intermediate steps” (p. 558). De Vries's first paragraph of description boldly expresses the contra­diction between this statement and Darwinian principles. (But note how he declines to attach Darwin's name to the orthodoxy he opposes — speaking in­stead only of “current scientific belief,” or “the ordinary conception”):

This is a striking point, and the one that is in the most immediate contradiction to current scientific belief. The ordinary conception assumes very slow changes, in fact, so slow that centuries are supposed to be required to make the differences appreciable. If this were true, all chance of ever seeing a new species arise would be hopelessly small. Fortunately, the evening primroses exhibit contrary tendencies . . . The mutants that constitute the first representatives of their race, exhibit all the attri­butes of the new type in full display at once. No series of generations, no selection, no struggle for existence are needed to reach this end (1905, p. 558).



2. “New forms spring laterally from the main stem” (p. 560). De Vries presents a cogent defense of cladogenetic vs. anagenetic modes for conceptu­alizing evolutionary change, including the full set of implications that con­tinue to evoke debate today:

The current conception concerning the origin of species assumes that species are slowly converted into others. The conversion is assumed to affect all the individuals in the same direction and in the same degree. The whole group changes its character, acquiring new attributes.... The birth of the new species necessarily seemed to involve the death of the old one ... The general belief is not supported by the evidence of the eve­ning primroses. There is neither a slow nor sudden change of all the indi­viduals. On the contrary, the vast majority remains unchanged; thousands are seen exactly repeating the original prototype yearly, both in the na­tive field and in my garden. There is no danger that Lamarckiana might die out from the act of mutating, nor that the mutating strains it would be exposed to ultimate destruction from this cause (pp. 560–561).



3. “New elementary species attain their full constancy at once” (p. 562). Again, de Vries states his first words of explanation in a forthrightly and ex­plicitly anti-Darwinian manner, in this case confuting gradualism and the adaptationist perspective. “Constancy is not the result of selection or of im­provement. It is a quality of its own. It can neither be constrained by selection if it is absent from the beginning nor does it need any natural or artificial aid if it is present” (pp. 562–563).

4. “Some of the new strains are evidently elementary species, while others are to be considered as varieties” (p. 564). De Vries regarded his taxonomy of relative merit and evolutionary potency of mutations (discussed on pp. 431–434) as sufficiently important to rank as one of the seven cardinal statements.

5. “The same new species are produced in a large number of individuals” (p. 566). De Vries also recognized the importance of his distinctive, non-gene­alogical principle (see p. 433) that mutations forming new “elementary spe­cies” may arise several times (thus imparting a greater chance of success to the novel taxon).

6. “The relation between mutability and fluctuating variability” (p. 568) — so stated as a phrase rather than a declarative sentence. De Vries recognized this causal claim for a fundamental distinction between two modes of varia­tion as the focus of his theory (see pp. 430–432). No other point received so much discussion in his texts. I do not know why he placed this fundamental statement of his reductionist program in 6th position among 7 statements.

7. “The mutations take place in nearly all directions” (p. 570 — I shall pre­sent a more extensive discussion of this claim on pp. 446–451). De Vries em­phasized this statement as his major tactic for maintaining fealty with Darwin at macroevolutionary scales, while destroying his mentor's theory for the ori­gin of species. If the phenotypic ranges of new species form an isotropic dis­tribution about the parental type, then the manifest directionality of evolu­tion at geological scales must record the action of a higher selection process upon these species-level variations. Can a form of Darwinian argument there­fore prevail among species (to produce trends), even while the sudden origin of new species precludes selectionism in Darwin's own favored realm?

From this conceptual foundation, de Vries reached further to promote his mutation theory as the basis for an overarching worldview. To illustrate the range of implications explicitly developed by de Vries, consider just two is­sues of widely differing import. On the first, and practical, question of bene­fits to agriculture, the mutation theory suggested that conventional selection (on fluctuating variation) could only yield limited and easily reversed im­provements. But new mutations might secure large and permanent benefits. Yet, as a practical dilemma, new mutations are rare and cannot be induced by our efforts. What benefit can emerge from scientific horticulture if this disci­pline must wait patiently for good fortune, and can then only apply the jour­neyman's procedure of preservation and propagation: “the practice of the horticulturist in producing new varieties is limited to isolation, whenever chance affords them” (1905, p. 606). As a legitimate escape from this dis­abling consequence of his theory, de Vries proposed that future knowledge of the causes of mutation might place evolutionary alteration under our control, and give us power so far beyond the scope of selection that we might truly be­come the masters of nature: “We may search for mutable plants in nature, or we may hope to induce species to become mutable by artificial methods. The first promises to yield results most quickly, but the scope of the second is much greater and it may yield results of far more importance. Indeed, if it should once become possible to bring plants to mutate at our will and per­haps even in arbitrarily chosen directions, there is no limit to the power we may finally hope to gain over nature” (1905, p. 688).

On the second, and theoretical, issue of insights from evolutionary theory for human cultural and racial differences, de Vries stated, with principled consistency, that his views on the origin of species suggested no implications whatever: “Our knowledge of the origin of species in nature has no bearing on social questions” (1909a, volume 1, p. 156). De Vries regarded human ra­cial distinctions as arising entirely from selection (or drift) upon fluctuating variability. Homo sapiens resides, with the vast majority of species, in a long­standing phase of stability; not, like the evening primrose, in a rare state of mutability: “Since the beginning of the diluvial period, man has not given rise to any new races or types. He is, in fact, immutable, albeit highly variable” (1909a, volume 1, p. 156). This fluctuating variation provides a source for all racial differences, which, however “profound” in phenotypic appearance, must therefore remain as limited and changeable as any alteration fashioned in this weak Darwinian mode:

Many mistakes may in the future be avoided if a clear distinction be drawn between mutability and variability in the ordinary sense. The variability exhibited by man is of the fluctuating kind: whereas species arise by mutation. The two phenomena are fundamentally different. The assumption that human variability bears any relation to the variation, which has or is supposed to have caused the origin of species, is to my mind absolutely unjustified. Man is a permanent type, like the vast ma­jority of species of animals and plants ... As we have seen, it is charac­teristic of these types to exhibit a certain amount of fluctuating variabil­ity. Man is no exception to this rule. Therefore all that we can apply to the treatment of social questions is our knowledge of ordinary variabil­ity. The facts of specific differentiation are interesting but not relevant (1909a, volume 1, pp. 154-155).



In sum, de Vries' Mutation Theory became the most important set of con­cepts in evolutionary biology during the early 20th century. The theory at­tained this central status by (1) its radically different and non-Darwinian view of the origin of species; (2) the breadth of its concerns, ranging from variation at the smallest scale to modes of geological pattern at the largest; (3) the range of its implications, as illustrated above, thus expanding the doctrine from a scientific theory to a comprehensive worldview.





Darwinism and the mutation theory




Confusing rhetoric, and the personal factor. The Muta­tion Theory — in its logic, on its face (and clearly in the eyes of de Vries' con­temporaries) — seems so evidently contrary to the central tenets of Darwin­ism. Kellogg classified de Vries' theory as one of the three major alternatives to natural selection (with Lamarckism and orthogenesis as the other candi­dates). De Vries himself, and with relish, explained his theory in the light of Galton's polyhedron (pp. 342–351), the primary anti-Darwinian metaphor of his day:

Little shocks make it totter; it oscillates round its position of equilibrium and finally returns to it. A slightly stronger push however can make it go so far that it comes to lie on a new side. The oscillations round a position of equilibrium are the fluctuations; the transitions from one position of equilibrium to another correspond to the mutations. The track left be­hind by the rolling polyhedron can be regarded as the line of descent of the species; each subdivision of this track, corresponding to a side of the polyhedron, representing a particular elementary species; each transi­tional movement to a new position of mutation (1909a, volume 1, p. 55).



Yet I began this section on de Vries with a strange story about the uniquely sour note that he introduced into Darwin's biggest centenary party by tortur­ing a Darwinian quotation to gain his master's supposed approval for a mani­festly un-Darwinian view about the nature of variability (pp. 415–417). I then discussed the powerful psychological and intellectual hold that Darwin exerted upon de Vries through his status as personal hero (pp. 421–423). I claim no insight into the subtleties of psychology, but de Vries' relationship with Darwin surely ranks as the most complex, enigmatic, and contradictory personal interaction discussed in this book. Other paired opponents — Cuvier and Geoffroy, Weismann and Spencer, for example — battled in public and provide the usual stuff of controversy. But de Vries met Darwin only once, and their struggle unfolded later, and largely within de Vries' own head.

De Vries managed (and apparently needed) to support several contradic­tory propositions, to play several roles at the same time: a loyal disciple, who would neither propagate nor tolerate any diminution of his master's fame and Tightness; a shrewd compromiser, who would bring a glorious past into har­mony with later discoveries; a novel revolutionary, who could sweep aside the old and establish a startlingly different theory as a source of personal fame. In documenting the range of de Vries' rhetorical strategies, one can only expe­rience the frustration of any careful and attentive reader in trying to locate a coherent center among the welter of contradictory claims.* Consider de Vries' several positions:

1. The mutation theory is fully Darwinian. (Darwin might have flirted with a false idea about the efficacy of fluctuating variation, but he ultimately rec­ognized the primacy, if not the exclusivity, of mutational variation.)

It is in fullest harmony with the great principle laid down by Darwin. In order to be acted upon by that complex of environmental forces, which Darwin has called natural selection, the changes must obviously first be there. The manner in which they are produced is of secondary impor­tance and has hardly any bearing on the theory of descent with modifica­tion. A critical survey of all the facts of variability of plants in nature as well as under cultivation had led me to the conviction, that Darwin was right in stating that those rare beneficial variations, which from time to time happen to arise — the now so-called mutations — are the real source of progress in the whole realm of the organic world (1909a, volume 1, p. 74).



This comment advances the stubborn position that so frustrated A. C. Seward, and inspired his justified rejoinder at Darwin's birthday party. De Vries' argument must be designated as a remarkable example of “stonewall­ing,” a word just entering the English language in de Vries' time (according to the OED) from a combination of British cricket slang, Australian political terminology, and the memory of Confederate General Stonewall Jackson. In the light of Darwin's firm and consistent emphasis on imperceptibly gradual change, and his equally clear denial of the efficacy of “sports” (a term that de Vries acknowledged as synonymous with his mutations), how could de Vries count Darwin as a saltationist? De Vries admits that Darwin didn't really say the proper words, but he then claims that Darwin must have intended to do so: “Darwin's view, although he never definitely formulated it, was that it was these occasional single variations which brought about the continual dif­ferentiation of living forms” (1909a, volume 1, pp. 86-87). De Vries then at­tributed the truly Darwinian belief in gradualism to Wallace and other less worthy epigones: “Wallace's view is that the material for species forming se­lection is furnished by fluctuating variability; and that these infinitesimal dif­ferences are gradually heaped up in the same direction until ultimately they attain the dimensions of specific differences” (ibid., p. 87) — a good definition of Darwin's actual view!

2. The mutation theory is Darwinian, while also incorporating a few minor glosses and corrections of Darwin's own views.

The mutation theory is intended to be a support and corollary to the selection theory of Darwin. There can be no doubt that Darwin correctly set forth the essential steps in the evolutionary process and that changes in his views mostly relate to those minor points, for which, at this time, the material of facts was not adequate to a correct decision. The muta­tion theory claims to remove many of the difficulties, inherent to the Darwinian doctrine, as e.g. the general occurrence of useless characters and the impossibility of explaining the first beginning of a selection on the ground of its usefulness (1922, p. 223).



3. The mutation theory is Darwinian. We must admit Darwin's errors on some issues, even for important points. But we can't blame him, given the limitations of knowledge in his time: “My work claims to be in full accord with the principles laid down by Darwin and to give a thorough and sharp analysis of some of the ideas of variability, inheritance, selection, and muta­tion, which were necessarily vague at his time. It is only just to state, that Darwin established so broad a basis for scientific research upon these sub­jects, that after half a century many problems of major interest remained to be taken up” (1905, p. ix).

4. Darwin recognized both fluctuating and mutational variation, but he never formulated a judgment about their relative importance (a direct contra­diction of claim 1 on the dominance or exclusivity of mutational variation): “Darwin almost always speaks of these two types in his discussion on selec­tion but never separates them, and is always in doubt as to their relative im­portance in the origin of species” (1909a, volume 1, p. 31).

In a variation upon this position, de Vries sometimes claimed that Darwin's agnosticism about the relative importance of these two types of variation holds no significance for evolution, and indicates no weakness in Darwin's logic, because the issue of how variation arises becomes subordinate to the role of natural selection once we feel confident that organisms will generate sufficient variation in any case: “Darwin has left the decision on this difficult and obviously subordinate point to his followers” (1909b, p. 84).

5. Darwin recognized both fluctuating and mutational variation and re­garded both modes as important. Wallace later restricted “Darwinism” to the fluctuating mode alone (de Vries, 1905, p. 8). True Darwinians, who continue to recognize both modes, tend to be favorable towards the Mutation Theory (though they must revise their views on the relative significance of fluctuating variation):

Unlike the prevailing form of the theory of selection, the doctrine of mutation lays stress on sudden or discontinuous changes, and regards only these as active in the formation of species. The Darwinian form of the theory of selection regards both these and fluctuating variations as operative in the origin of new forms, whilst Wallace favors the other extreme, according to which all formation of species goes by a slow and gradual process of change. The two schools of thought naturally adopt different attitudes towards the doctrine of mutation. It is at once rejected by Wallace's adherents, whilst those who incline to Darwin's own form of the theory are less unreservedly inimical; many of them have even greeted it with open arms (1909a, volume 2, p. 599).



6. Darwin recognized both kinds of variation. Early in his career he cor­rectly emphasized the mutational mode. Unfortunately, his critics later bad­gered him into a more extreme and less generous commitment to the primacy of fluctuating variation (note the direct contradiction to claim 4 and, in turn, the contradiction of 4 and 1 — quite an intellectual odyssey: from exclusivity of one form, to pluralism, to exclusivity of the other. Note also that de Vries often stated all these positions in the same publication; thus, I am not only re­cording a consistent and legitimate ontogenetic change in opinion): “To sum up, we see that Darwin always distinguished between individual differences and single variations and that he ascribed to the latter at least a very consider­able role in the origin of species. It was only by the pressure of criticism that he finally gave up this view and gave the place of honor to the ever-present in­dividual variations” (1909a, volume 1, p. 39).

7. Darwin erred in advocating natural selection for the origin of species. The Mutation Theory has corrected this basic mistake, and therefore repre­sents a novel direction for evolutionary thought. Darwin deserves our highest praise for his historical role, but he has now been superseded:

The theory of descent aims at the scientific explanation of systematic relationship. It is Darwin's immortal service to have obtained general recognition for this generalization. By doing this he revolutionized the whole of biological, systematic, embryological and paleontological sci­ence. Tapping inexhaustible sources for new investigation and discover­ing everywhere mines where new facts were to be had for the picking up. The several propositions and hypotheses which Darwin employed as supports for this theory should be regarded now only as such, since their interest is mainly historical. They have served their purpose and are thereby fully justified... This is especially true of the theory of selec­tion, which now has served its time as an argument for the theory of descent; happily this theory no longer stands in need of such support (1909a, volume 1, p. 28).



8. The theory of natural selection is erroneous. The theory of mutation is correct. “The mutation theory is opposed to that conception of the theory of selection which is now prevalent. According to the latter view the material for the origin of new species is afforded by ordinary or so-called individual varia­tion. According to the mutation theory individual variation has nothing to do with the origin of species. This form of variation, as I hope to show, cannot even by the most rigid and sustained selection lead to a genuine overstepping of the limits of the species and still less to the origin of new and constant char­acters” (1909a, volume 1, p. 4).

One might conjecture that this full range of viewpoints represents a transi­tion from heart (in the early entries of the sequence) to mind — that is, from de Vries' need to express fealty with his personal hero to his recognition of the oppositional logic within his own system. (One might also be more cynical and interpret the early entries as diplomatic attempts to court favor with Dar­winians — but I don't think that this interpretation can be fairly defended, for Darwinism did not rank as a dominant philosophy at the time, and issues of heart hold such evident prominence for de Vries.) The Mutation Theory, with its explicitly saltational and nonadaptational origin of species, must be read as a confutation of Darwinism on the central question (the title of Darwin's book, after all) of “The Origin of Species.” And yet, by an interesting argu­ment (developed in the next section), de Vries did provide a genuine and am­ple field for Darwinian logic in another realm, even while he tried to extirpate natural selection without compromise on its own original turf.



The logic of Darwinism and its different place in de vries' system. I have documented the psychological vacillation in de Vries's assessment of Darwin, but a stark contrast must be drawn between this frustrating emotional indefiniteness and de Vries' clear and subtle under­standing of selectionist logic. I think that only two other early evolutionists — Weismann and Darwin himself — ever grasped so fully, both in basic logic and expanding implications, the rich meanings of selectionism. De Vries' per­sonal dilemma lay in his unwillingness to tar his personal hero with the brush of selectionist errors (in his judgment), not in any softness or vacil­lation in understanding selection itself. Thus, he tried to distance Darwin from Darwin's own beliefs, grasping at straws (often of de Vries' own con­struction) in tortuous exegetical efforts to remake Darwin as a closet saltationist.

One can hardly deny that de Vries' Mutation Theory represents, in princi­ple, about as anti-Darwinian a mechanism as anyone could construct at the crucial level of Darwin's own concerns (and chosen book title) — the origin of species. Neither selection nor adaptation can play a creative role in evolution­ary change if new species arise in single, fortuitous leaps.

Yet de Vries insisted that his theory followed Darwinian principles at the larger scale of full unrolling of life's history — and here he presented a sound and fascinating argument that his contemporaries never understood (in their failure to grasp the generality of selectionist logic) and that later history therefore, and unfortunately, forgot. I argued in Chapter 2 that the operation of a selectionist mechanism makes three crucial demands upon the nature of internal “raw material”: that variation be copious, small in scope (relative to the unit of incremental change at the scale under consideration), and undi­rected (isotropic). At the level of speciation, de Vries' Mutation Theory be­comes decidedly anti-Darwinian by failing the second test — for single muta­tions generate new species in one step, and no creative role can be assigned to selection or adaptation at all.

But suppose that we “promote” our gaze and consider evolutionary trends through geological time as the relevant scale of change. Then a species-form­ing mutational step might be considered sufficiently small (relative to the full trend) to fit into Darwinian logic — though not into Darwin's own theory, which explicitly requires, as its central tenet, that a process of organismal se­lection must govern the origin of species.

But if we can regard speciational steps as small increments in macroevolution, then the applicability of Darwinian logic to trends would depend upon the validity of the remaining two criteria at this higher level: copious­ness and isotropy. The criterion of copiousness will surely be fulfilled in lin­eages undergoing a de Vriesian period of mutability. The full operation of Darwinian logic at this larger scale will then stand or fall upon the remaining criterion of isotropy. De Vries analyzed the issue in these appropriate terms and, by stating strong support for isotropy. He therefore identified a proper fealty with Darwinian logic (in a domain different from Darwin's own appli­cation, after denying the efficacy of the same general logic in Darwin's own favored realm).

De Vries often states the principle of isotropy as one of his central conclusions: all characters may mutate in all directions. “Single variations [mutations] seem to be presented by all characters, to proceed in every direction and to be apparently without limit” (1909a, volume 1, p. 33). Moreover, de Vries expresses this view not only as an empirical conclusion but as a logical consequence of his theory: “The mutation theory demands that organisms should exhibit mutability in almost all directions” (1909a, volume 1, p. 204).

Even more significantly, de Vries recognizes that isotropy must be asserted to validate Darwinian selection at the higher level of evolutionary trends. Tying isotropy directly to the efficacy of selection, de Vries writes (1905, p. 574): “Nearly all qualities vary in opposite directions and our group of mutants affords wide material for the sifting process of natural selection.” Se­lection can only operate as a sieve, but if variations are copious, isotropic and small (a good description for the status of de Vriesian mutations relative to the full extent of a geological trend), then these species-forming mutations can forge no large-scale cladal trend by themselves — and even a sieve, by ex­tended directional accumulation, becomes a creative mechanism. (This meta­phor beautifully restates Darwin's basic argument about the creativity of se­lection — see Chapter 2. But de Vries denies selection at Darwin's own favored level of organisms in populations, and grants power to Darwin's mechanism only at the higher level of sustained trends among species in clades.)

According to Darwin, changes occur in all directions, quite indepen­dently of the prevailing circumstances. Some may be favorable, others detrimental, many of them without significance, neither useful nor injurious. Some of them will sooner or later be destroyed, while others will survive, and which of them will survive is obviously incumbent on the question, whether their particular changes agree with the existing conditions or not. This is what Darwin has called the struggle for life. It is a large sieve, and it only acts as such. Some fall through and are annihi­lated, others remain above and are selected, as the phrase goes. Many are selected, but more are destroyed: daily observation does not leave any doubt upon this point. How the differences originate is quite another question. It has nothing to do with the theory of natural selection, nor with the struggle for life (1905, p. 571).



De Vries strongly rejected any notion of directed variability (nonisotropy) in the production of trends — and therefore maintained no sympathy at all for the orthogenetic school. He even slipped into the philosophic fallacy that Whitman criticized (see p. 385), by equating nonisotropy with teleology in the strong sense of inherently unscientific assertion: “According to the Darwinian principle, species forming variability — mutability — does not take place in definite directions. According to that theory, deviations take place in almost every direction without preference for any particular one, and espe­cially without preference for that direction along which differentiation hap­pens to be proceeding. Every hypothesis which differs from Darwin's in this respect must be rejected as teleological and unscientific” (1909a, volume 1, p. 198).

In a later, remarkable passage, de Vries gathered all these elements together, identifying nonisotropy as both a central Darwinian claim and a necessary bulwark in the struggle against supernaturalism. He also acknowledges that Darwin applied the resulting selectionist mechanism at the organismal level, whereas he favors the species level, thus devising a fundamentally different theory:

We are strongly opposed to the concept of a definite “tendency to vary” which would bring about useful changes, or at least favor their appear­ance. The great service, which Darwin did, was that he demonstrated the possibility of accounting for the evolution of the whole animal and vegetable kingdom without invoking the aid of supernatural agencies. According to him, species forming variability exists without any reference to the fitness of the forms to which it gives rise. It simply provides mate­rial for natural selection to operate on. And whether this selection takes place between individuals, as Darwin and Wallace thought, or whether it decides between the existence of whole species, as I think; it is the pos­sibility of existence under given external conditions which determines whether a new form shall survive or not... The mutability of Oenothera Lamarckiana satisfies all these theoretical conditions per­fectly. Nearly all organs and all characters mutate, and in almost every conceivable direction and combination (1909a, volume 1, p. 257).



I have presented this extended treatment of de Vries for a reason embedded in the plan of this chapter, and crucial to the logic of this book. I argue that “internalism” poses two separate challenges to pure Darwinian functionalism: saltational change arising from internal forces of mutability, and inher­ent directionality of variation (corresponding to facet-flipping and channeling on Galton's polyhedron). Most internalists (“structuralists,” “formalists,” “laws of form” theorists in other terminologies) emphasize the second theme of channels and preferred directionality of variation (now most often ex­pressed in the popularity of “constraints” as a subject in modern evolution­ary literature — see Chapters 10 and 11). This style of internalism represents the primary theme of Goethe, of Geoffroy, of Owen, and of the orthogeneticists. Fewer internalists emphasize the saltational theme — and those who do, like Bateson, tend to support channeling as well as facet flipping (for the two themes fuse well into a coherent anti-Darwinian philosophy, as Bateson recognized and articulated).

When such basic themes commingle, our experimental traditions lead us to search for “pure” end-member cases — examples of one item without the other, so that we may assess the unadulterated contribution of each theme treated separately. We can identify several pure channeling theorists — biolo­gists, who extolled directional variation, but supported gradualism and re­jected saltation (several orthogeneticists fall into this category). But we rarely encounter a “pure” saltationist who accepts isotropy for large-scale changes and rejects all notions of preferred directionality. (Since saltation also implies an internal control upon change, the allied theme of preferred directions usu­ally gains assent as well — as in Bateson's arguments on homeotic variation.) But de Vries represents our instructive “pure” case of one without the other — a saltationist who accepted the isotropy of these immediate and substantial changes. Moreover, de Vries explicated the logic of his unusual commitment to recognize the interesting role that such a “nonstandard combination” must imply for Darwinism. (Saltationism precluded any role for selection in the or­igin of species; but mutational isotropy resurrected the Darwinian apparatus at the higher level of evolutionary trends.) As a “test case,” therefore, de Vries — all by himself — balances the rest of this chapter, with its primary em­phasis on internally channeled variation. De Vries's brilliance, particularly his clear attention to Darwinian logic, makes him a particularly attractive and in­structive figure in our quest to understand the components of internalist thinking.





De Vries on macroevolution


De Vries never placed primary emphasis upon macroevolutionary themes in his books, but these issues do receive more than passing attention. By his own intent and reckoning, de Vries' main contribution to macroevolution lay in his resolution of Kelvin's paradox — an earth too young to permit evolution by Darwinian gradualism (see Chapter 6). Obviously, if new species arise per saltum in a single generation, limits on the earth's age would not preclude the evolutionary work actually accomplished. “The demands of the biologists and the results of the physicists are harmonized on the ground of the theory of mutation” (1905, p. 712). “One of the greatest objections to the Darwin­ian theory of descent arose from the length of time it would require if all evolution was to be explained on the ground of slow and nearly invisible changes. This difficulty is at once met, and fully surmounted by the hypothe­sis of periodical but sudden and quite noticeable steps. This assumption re­quires only a limited number of mutative periods, which might occur within the time allowed by physicists and geologists for the existence of animal and vegetable life on the earth” (1905, p. 29).

De Vries even made a semi-quantitative assessment, based again on Oenothera. Given Kelvin's 24 million year estimate for a habitable earth, even one mutation (adding a character) every 4,000 years would provide 6,000 new features for any extant lineage. Since neither Oenothera, nor any other creature, bears so many distinct features (“a number far higher than comparative and systematic science can by any means accumulate in its descriptions” — 1909a, volume 2, p. 665), geological time becomes positively bounteous for requirements of the mutation theory. De Vries epitomized his view in an “equation” (not really a mathematical formula, but a set of con­cepts epitomized by letters): M x L = BT, or number of mutations times length of intervals between mutations equals “biological time.” So long as bi­ological time doesn't exceed available geological time, Kelvin's paradox may be resolved.

But de Vries' main contribution to macroevolution does not lie in this ex­plicit geological aid (soon made irrelevant by radioactive extension of the earth's age in any case). Rather, de Vries formulated a fully articulated macroevolutionary theory based on the application of Darwinian logic to the higher level of species and trends — a true theory of “species selection” (even so named by de Vries!). I do not think that de Vries ever recognized the full im­port of what he had done — for he never grants the theme real prominence, and pieces of the argument lie scattered throughout his writing. But de Vries developed all the parts, and they do cohere. His acute understanding of Dar­winian logic (a grasp that also led him to reject selection where he felt that such a mechanism couldn't apply) drove him on and informed all the dispa­rate elements of his thinking.

De Vries developed his macroevolutionary concepts as a set of logical implications from the Mutation Theory. He recognized, first of all, that an ori­gin of new species by recurrent and effectively identical saltation provides no variation for the working of any Darwinian process of selection: “ [Perhaps] the mutants of one type ... would not be pure ... but would exhibit different degrees of deviation from the parent. The best would then have to be chosen in order to get the new type in its pure condition. Nothing of the kind, how­ever, was observed. All the oblonga mutants were pure oblongas. The pedi­gree shows hundreds of them in the succeeding years, but no difference was seen and no material for selection was afforded” (1905, pp. 559-560).

All effective evolutionary variation exists only among the “elementary species” formed by mutation from a parental stock, not among individual organisms within these species. In principle, therefore, if selection works as an evo­lutionary force at all, Darwin's process can only sort elementary species, not organisms within populations. De Vries clearly recognizes the difference be­tween the conventional Darwinian form of organismal selection and his pro­posal for selection among elementary species: “The struggle for existence, that is to say the competition for the means of subsistence, may refer to two entirely different things. On the one hand, the struggle takes place between the individuals of one and the same elementary species, on the other between the various species themselves. The former is a struggle between fluctuations, the latter between mutations” (1909a, volume 1, pp. 211-212).

Horticulturists, de Vries noted, recognize the two modes with different names (1905, pp. 604-605) — “race-breeding” for the limited and relatively ineffective Darwinian sorting based on fluctuating variation among organisms in a population; and “variety-testing” for sorting among discrete ele­mentary species produced by mutation. In a remarkable passage, de Vries then names this second mode “species selection,”* and also denies that this higher-level process can be equated with natural selection:

The word selection has come to have more than one meaning. Facts have accumulated enormously since the time of Darwin; a more thorough knowledge has brought about distinction, and divisions at a rapidly increasing rate, with which terminology has not kept pace. Selection includes all kinds of choice... Selection must, in the first place, make a choice between the elementary species of the same systematic form. This selection of species or species selection [my italics] is now in general use in practice where it has received the name of variety testing. This clear and unequivocal term however, can hardly be included under the head of natural selection. The poetic terminology of selection by nature has al­ready brought about many difficulties that should be avoided in the fu­ture. On the other hand, the designation of the process as a natural selec­tion of species complies as closely as possible with existing terminology, and does not seem liable to any misunderstanding. It is a selection be­tween species. Opposed to it is the selection within the species (1905, pp. 742-744).



De Vries then develops this concept, of species selection as a set of guide­lines for a general theory of macroevolution. He argues that sustained evolu­tionary trends must arise by species selection for two reasons: (1) Variation among species represents the only available “fuel” for an effective process of selection. (2) Trends are clearly adaptive and accumulative, but the mutational origin of elementary species is both nonadaptive and discretely sudden. Mutations, therefore, cannot produce trends by themselves; a “higher-order” selection upon discrete mutational phenotypes must occur:

The differentiating characteristics of elementary species are only very small. How widely distant they are from the beautiful adaptive organizations of orchids, of insectivorous plants and of so many others! Here the difference lies in the accumulation of numerous elementary characters, which all contribute to the same end. Chance must have produced them, and this would seem absolutely improbable, even impossible, were it not for Darwin's ingenious theory. Chance there is, but no more than any­where else. It is not by mere chance that the variations move in the re­quired direction. They do go, according to Darwin's view, in all direc­tions, or at least in many. If these include the usual ones, and if this is repeated a number of times, cumulation is possible; if not, there is simply no progression, and the type remains stable through the ages. Natural se­lection is continually acting as a sieve, throwing out the useless changes and retaining the real improvements. Hence the accumulation in appar­ently predisposed directions, and hence the increasing adaptations to the more specialized conditions of life (1905, p. 572).



De Vries also recognizes that species selection must include two compo­nents, corresponding to birth and death biases in conventional organismic se­lection (1909a, volume 1, p. 200, and volume 2, p. 660): Species selection will favor those lineages that (1) produce more elementary species by muta­tion (birth bias), and (2) generate phenotypes fortuitously adapted to chang­ing local conditions (persistence bias).

The need for strong birth biases, combined with the central claim (see p. 435) that periods of mutability affect only a few species (and for a very short time relative to their geological longevity), led de Vries to embrace the importance and near universality of long-term stasis within species — an argu­ment strikingly isomorphic with the apparatus that we introduced much later in developing punctuated equilibrium (Eldredge and Gould, 1972; Gould and Eldredge, 1977, 1993 — and, again, much to my chagrin for not knowing about de Vries' earlier version. The two accounts invoke entirely different principles of saltational vs. allopatric speciation, but the two arguments still employ an isomorphic logic).

De Vries cites several supports for the empirics of stasis: the ability of systematists to define most taxa unambiguously; the persistence of identical phenotypes for centuries in populations that have become widely isolated (1909a, volume 1, p. 206); geological persistence through such epochs of ex­tensive climatic change as ice ages (1905, p. 696); documented longevity of many species through several geological periods (1905, pp. 698-699). De Vries then chides Darwinians for asserting imperceptible transmutation in the face of manifest, documented constancy. Darwinians have been driven to this inconsistency, de Vries asserts, by the gradualistic implications of their theory, but a more accurate view of evolutionary mechanisms affirms stasis as an ex­pectation, not an embarrassment to be ignored, or explained away by appeals to an imperfect fossil record:

Many facts plead in favor of the constancy of species. This principle has always been recognized by systematists. Temporarily the current form of the theory of natural selection has assumed species to be inconstant, ever changing and continuously improved and adapted to the requirements of the life conditions. The followers of the theory of descent believed that this conclusion was unavoidable and were induced to deny the manifest fact that species are constant entities. The mutation theory gives a clue to the final combination of the two contending ideas. Reducing the changeability of the species to distinct and probably short periods, it at once ex­plains how the stability of species perfectly agrees with the principle of descent through modification (1905, p. 694).



In his earlier writings (1905, 1909a), de Vries strongly supported adapta­tion as the primary result of trends forged by species selection. But he altered this conviction in later articles, and thereby came to espouse the full range of internalist critiques against Darwin (in questioning both gradualism and functionalism). In 1922, de Vries contributed a short, but highly revealing chapter to J. C. Willis' famous critique of adaptation based on the correlation of geographic distribution and geological longevity: Age and Area (Willis, 1922).

Of course, de Vries had always opposed adaptationism for the origin of species (1922, p. 224) because selection cannot craft good design if species arise in single steps: “Specific characters have evolved without any relation to their possible significance in the struggle for life. The facts are contrary to the main principle of the selection theory of Darwin” (1922, p. 226). De Vries in­terpreted Willis' argument as a final proof for this linchpin of his theory — and he expressed delight: “The general belief in adaptation as one of the chief causes of the evolution of specific characters is best directly contradicted by the statistical studies of Willis . . . This result must be considered as the one great proof, which the mutation theory still wanted for its acceptance in the field of systematic zoology and botany” (1922, p. 227).

But differentia of higher taxa arises by cumulation during species selection, and may therefore be adaptive. “It is a curious fact that most of the striking instances of beautiful adaptation to special forms of life are characters of gen­era and sub-genera, or even of whole families, but not of single species. Climbing plants and tendrils, insectivorous plants, desert types — submerged water plants, and numerous other instances could be adduced” (1922, p. 22). (De Vries regarded the distinction between nonadaptation in most defining traits of species, and adaptation for the differentia of higher taxa, as virtual proof for the nonselectionist origin of species by saltation and the functional origin of higher taxa by species selection.)

Still later, however, and further inspired by Willis, de Vries reasserted even this restricted role for adaptation — as he recognized that an a posteriori func­tional correlation of form and environment (especially for broad characters of higher taxa) need not indicate adaptive fashioning under current circum­stances. Using an argument of exaptation (Gould and Vrba, 1982, and Chap­ter 11), de Vries recognized and embraced the alternative view that such char­acters arise for an immediate reason (often nonadaptive), then radiate out randomly by Willis' argument, and finally survive in environments that, by good fortune for the species, favor a set of characters originally evolved for reasons unrelated to current function:

Everywhere in nature, in geological periods as well as at present, the morphological characters of newly originated types have no special significance in the struggle for life. They are not known to aid them in their initial dispersal. They may afterwards prove to be useful or useless, but this has no influence upon their evolution. Obvious instances of useful­ness occur, as a rule, only at much later periods during the wandering of the new forms, when unexpectedly they arrive in environments specially fitted for them. The usual phrase, that species are adapted to their envi­ronment, should therefore be read inversely, stating that most species are now found to live under conditions fit for them. The adaptation is not on the side of the species, but on that of the environment. In a popular way we could say that in the long run species choose their best environment (1922, pp. 226-227).



I ran into Ernst Mayr as I was completing this chapter and asked him if he had ever met de Vries. “No,” he said, “botanists and zoologists didn't talk to each other very much in those days, and, anyway, I was a Lamarckian then.” The reasons for their failure to meet may have been non-ideological (largely generational and disciplinary), but I treasure, nonetheless, the image of the world's greatest Darwinian at the close of the 20th century, then about the same age as de Vries at this most non-Darwinian endpoint of his career, speaking about their non-interaction. De Vries did come to inhabit a different world. Whatever his love and fealty for Darwin, de Vries expunged the guid­ing concept of natural selection from his hero's own realm of the origin of species. But de Vries then reinserted selection into the higher domain of macroevolution — at least until he eventually dropped the functional theme from this world as well. De Vries developed cogent critiques, though his al­ternative mechanism can no longer be defended. His bannings and separa­tions must now be judged as too stark. Instead, we need to expand and modify Darwin's world to a hierarchical view of selection operating differently and simultaneously at several levels of nature's individuality — and not segre­gate natural selection to exclusive operation in a single domain, whether organismal (for Darwin) or speciational (for de Vries).





RICHARD GOLDSCHMIDT'S APPROPRIATE ROLE AS A FORMALIST EMBODIMENT OF ALL THAT PURE DARWINISM MUST OPPOSE





“It was nearly eleven hundred, and in the Records Department, where Winston worked, they were dragging the chairs out of the cubicles and group­ing them in the center of the hall, opposite the big telescreen, in preparation for the Two Minutes Hate ... A hideous, grinding screech . . . burst from the telescreen . . . The Hate had started. As usual, the face of Emmanuel Gold­stein, the Enemy of the People, had flashed onto the screen” (George Orwell, 1984). In my own factual version of this fictional archetype, we snickered over a deluded man rather than screaming at a potentially dangerous en­emy — but the expectation of group reaction, based on little more than our ig­norance combined with the prompting of our leaders, still evokes an eerie and uncomfortable feeling of similarity in my memory.

I began my graduate work at Columbia University in 1963 (after undergraduate study at small, iconoclastic Antioch College), just a few years af­ter the codification of the hardest versions of the Modern Synthesis in and around the Darwin centennial celebrations of 1959 (see Chapter 7). I had never heard of Richard Goldschmidt. Yet his name surfaced in almost every course — never with any explication of his views, but only in a fleeting and de­risive reference to something called a “hopeful monster.” Students then re­sponded with a derisive sign of recognition — as our professors seemed to ex­pect as a badge of membership in some inner circle. I found the oft-repeated exercise — one might almost have called it a ritual — offensive and demeaning, both to Goldschmidt and to any notion of my potentially independent intelli­gence.

My memories cannot be deemed either exaggerated or idiosyncratic. Frazzetta (1975, p. 85) recalled similar experiences from another university: “No one stopped to consider whether in all of Goldschmidt's assailable proposi­tions, there existed anything worth thinking about. There was no time for such consideration as long as there was so much merry mayhem to be carried out. In my university classes, the name 'Goldschmidt' was always introduced as a kind of biological 'in joke,' and all we students laughed and snickered dutifully to prove that we were not guilty of either ignorance or heresy.” Guy Bush (1982) corroborates our memories: “When his name did come up it was inevitably in the context of 'hopeful monsters' and to the accompani­ment of subdued snickers and knowing nods. It didn't take long to learn that Richard B. Goldschmidt was not to be taken seriously as an evolutionary bi­ologist.”

A few years later, when I unearthed Goldschmidt's Material Basis of Evolution from our library (and found much of value amidst some admitted non­sense), a senior colleague and former professor decided to check his own copy to see if he had formerly dismissed the book too harshly. He could not find the volume on his shelf, and only then remembered that he had discarded the book several years earlier as containing nothing of value!

Every orthodoxy needs a whipping boy, but why Goldschmidt? A question of personality, perhaps? Students and colleagues tend to remember Gold­schmidt (1878-1958) as kind and even courtly, but also as arrogant and im­perious, thus fulfilling anyone's stereotypical image of Herr Doktor, the Ger­man Professor. He did indeed hold such an official and topmost status, as first director of genetics at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biology in Berlin — un­til his Jewish ancestry forced relocation to Berkeley, and the start of a sec­ond career, in the late 1930's. Viktor Hamburger told me that fellow students called Goldschmidt “the Pope,” in reference (not deference) to his imperious-ness. (This apparently anomalous title may not be so peculiar for a promi­nent, established German-speaking Jew, a group that often surpassed the av­erage Prussian in loyalty and patriotism. I can still hear the acid words of my Yiddish-speaking Hungarian grandmother, recalling the snubs of well-bred Viennese girls, after her father sent her to a Jewish school in the capital of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.) Goldschmidt certainly practiced his penchant for pious proclamations ex cathedra: “I am certain that in the end I shall turn out to have been right” (1960, p. 307).

These factors of personality may have heightened his candidacy, and exac­erbated the depth of collegial reaction, but Goldschmidt surely became a whipping boy primarily, and properly, for ideological reasons. Goldschmidt's 1940 book, The Material Basis of Evolution, based on the Silliman Lectures given at Yale in 1939, became the standard text for his apostasy. We may specify several rationales, based on the major claims of this volume, for Goldschmidt's anathematized status among the synthesists.

1. Above all, and in his characteristically uncompromising manner, Goldschmidt held that new species arose saltationally, by a mode of genetic change different in kind from the alterations that yield adaptive modification within species. (The controversial nature of this difference in “kind” identifies the key issue for a proper assessment of Goldschmidt, as we shall see.)

2. In Goldschmidt's view, Darwin had correctly described change within species as gradual, adaptive, and diversifying — but this mode of evolution leads only to the establishment of a Rassenkreis (a polytypic species), never to the formation of a new species. True species must be separated by “bridgeless gaps.” Goldschmidt organized The Material Basis of Evolution in two se­quential sets of chapters, entitled Microevolution and Macroevolution. In a scheme of argument that could not have been “better” designed to rouse ascendant neo-Darwinians to anger, the first part extols Darwinian processes in their strictly limited domain, while the second emphasizes their impo­tence in producing new species (while proposing workable alternatives in the saltationist mode). Goldschmidt links the two sections with the following paragraph — an anti-Darwinian clarion call that he printed entirely in italics: “Subspecies are actually, therefore, neither incipient species nor models for the origin of species. They are more or less diversified blind alleys within the species. The decisive step in evolution, the first step toward macroevolution, the step from one species to another, requires another evolutionary method than that of sheer accumulation of micromutations” (1940, p. 183).

3. Apostates may generate maximal anger, but not every opponent can gain such an anathematized status. A fool by nature, or a scholar who displays ignorance in the field of his chosen iconoclasm, cannot qualify, and will attract more pity than rage. Apostates must be smart, skilled, potentially effective (and therefore feared) — and also former adherents to the orthodoxy they now reject. Goldschmidt could not be dismissed as an ignorant “lab man,” unacquainted with the source of strongest Darwinian arguments — field data of natural history. He had undertaken one of the most thorough studies ever attempted on the empirics of geographic variation in a single species, the gypsy moth Lymantria dispar. He states that he had expected to affirm the Darwinian apparatus at all scales: “As a convinced Darwinian I believed geo­graphic races to be incipient species. I hoped to prove by such an analysis the correctness of this idea. I was completely acquainted with what twenty years later was rediscovered as 'the new systematics,' and my convictions, as ex­pressed in 1920 and 1923, were practically the same as those of present-day Neo-Darwinians” (1960, p. 318).

If Goldschmidt had simply rejected Darwinism outright, he would have angered the synthesists quite sufficiently. But Goldschmidt proceeded further to an argument almost guaranteed to arouse far deeper frustration. He pro­claimed the selectionist mechanism as completely sufficient to account for all differentiation within species — and then announced that this basic style of microevolution bore no causal relevance to the production of new species. In other words, he denied the cardinal extrapolationist premise that evolution in the small — the only mode routinely subject to direct observation — could, by extension in time, produce the entire panoply of life's history. To many syn­thesists, Goldschmidt's ideas ranked as an ultimate council of despair. How can science proceed at all without such a uniformitarian and operational premise?

Goldschmidt, as an enfant terrible, clearly enjoyed the fuss that he had engendered: “I certainly had struck a hornet's nest. The Neo-Darwinians re­acted savagely. This time I was not only crazy but almost a criminal” (1960, p. 324). He also provoked a vigorous and extended reaction. Most evolution­ists know, for example, that Ernst Mayr wrote one of the great classics of the Synthesis, Systematics and the Origin of Species (1942), as a direct response to Goldschmidt's Material Basis. Mayr recalled (1980, p. 420): “Even though personally I got along very well with Goldschmidt, I was thoroughly furious at his book, and much of the first draft of Systematics and the Origin of Spe­cies was written in angry reaction to Goldschmidt's total neglect of such over­whelming and convincing evidence.”

We may best illustrate the depth of feeling (and the perceived extent of Goldschmidt's apostasy) by examining the review of Material Basis written for Science by Th. Dobzhansky (1940), whose own Genetics and the Origin of Species had codified the developing Synthesis three years earlier. The rhe­torical strategy of this review embodies the general reaction of the emerging Neo-Darwinian consensus. Dobzhansky grants warmest praise to Gold­schmidt's persona and to the sweep of his effort. He begins by stating: “This book contains the only basically new theory of organic transformation pro­pounded during the current century” (1940, p. 356) — a peculiar statement, given the former popularity of de Vriesian saltationism (although Dobzhan­sky may have viewed de Vries's Mutation Theory, not formally printed until 1901, as a late 19th century formulation, especially since de Vries had pub­lished his major empirical work on Oenothera in the 1880's and 1890's). For Dobzhansky, only three serious theories of evolutionary mechanics precede Goldschmidt's book — Lamarckism, which “has become obsolete owing to its basic assumption having fallen short of experimental verification” (p. 356); autogenesis (orthogenesis), dismissed as “in conflict with the principle of causality in vogue in the materialistically-minded modern science” (loc. cit.); and Darwinism, which Dobzhansky accepts, and which “underwent great changes because of the forward strides of genetics, but the unbroken continuity of ideas between the 'neo-Darwinism' and Darwin's original theory is evi­dent.” Goldschmidt's book now “connotes an at least temporary end of the undivided reign of neo-Darwinian theories” (loc. cit.).

Dobzhansky covered his review in a patina of judiciousness, even of approbation. He also presents a fair and clear epitome of Goldschmidt's major points. Dobzhansky refers to Goldschmidt's theory as “brilliantly developed and masterfully presented” (p. 357), and he adds: “Goldschmidt's keenly crit­ical analysis has emphasized the weaknesses and deficiencies of the neo-Dar­winian conception of evolution, which are numerous, as even partisans ought to have the courage to admit” (p. 358).

But, in the deeper theme and purpose of his review, Dobzhansky's rejection could not have been more total or dismissive (much as he advocates a close reading and study of Goldschmidt's book). First of all, he does not count Goldschmidt's ideas as an evolutionary theory at all, as expressed in the title of Dobzhansky's review: “Catastrophism versus evolutionism.” The first sen­tence, as quoted above, presents Goldschmidt's theory as the first new view of “organic transformation,” not of evolution — words that Dobzhansky chose very carefully and purposefully. He then explains: “Goldschmidt not only rel­egates natural selection to a place of relative unimportance, but in effect re­jects evolution beyond the narrow confines in which it has been admitted to exist by Linnaeus and many creationists. His theory belongs to the realm of catastrophism, not to that of evolutionism.”

Recalling the stereotypical cry of the stadium vendor — “you can't tell the players without a scorecard” — later scholars often need a historical primer of definitions to identify certain claims properly. Dobzhansky refers here to Lyell's rhetorical strategy for specifying the requirements of a scientific geol­ogy. A truly scientific theory based on verae causae (true causes), Lyell tells us, must embrace the uniformitarian postulate that small-scale changes, observ­able on our current earth, can produce, by gradual accumulation through geological time, all the grand events of our planet's history. Evolution, for Dobzhansky, defines all theories of biological change set within this proper uniformitarian mode. The catastrophic alternative — that occasional parox­ysms sweep the earth to produce most important change, whereas the daily accumulation of tiny, observable alterations can lead to nothing substantial — represents a retreat to the bad old days of useless speculation and theological influence. Goldschmidt's saltational theory of the “hopeful monster” falls into this basically unscientific mode. As Lyell wrote in his magisterial prose (1833, p. 6): “Never was there a dogma more calculated to foster indolence, and to blunt the keen edge of curiosity ... We see the ancient spirit of specula­tion revived, and a desire manifested to cut, rather than patiently to untie, the Gordian knot.” Therefore, by placing Goldschmidt's book within the catastrophist tradition, Dobzhansky almost denies any scientific status to the theory at all.

Dobzhansky then reinforces his dismissal by declining even to present any counterarguments: “It is impossible to attempt here a critique of Gold­schmidt's theory, for this would require a book approximately the same size as his own” (p. 358 — indeed, Mayr would soon write such a rebuttal). But Dobzhansky's demurral does not prevent him from trying to annihilate Goldschmidt with the unkindest cut of all — an explicit removal of scientific status: “But in the reviewer's opinion the simplicity of Goldschmidt's theory is that of a belief in miracles” (p. 358).

No one can deny that Goldschmidt's theory merits historical attention for its palpable and extensive influence, at least upon the psyches of his major op­ponents. But we also need to assess whether anything in Goldschmidt's theory merits our respect and study today. We must therefore clarify a primary issue that Goldschmidt himself unfortunately plunged into deep confusion: how shall we characterize the genetic source of saltations that make new species? Beginning in the 1930's, and extending with increasing scope, unconventionality, and self-assurance to his death, Goldschmidt developed an idiosyncratic concept of genetics that eventually sought to refute the “particulate” or “cor­puscular” gene entirely (see the culmination of this development in Gold­schmidt's last and least cogent book — Theoretical Genetics, 1955. A compar­ison between Goldschmidt's “holistic” view and Bateson's unwillingness to abandon his “vibrational” theory of heredity would provide an interesting subject of research. I suspect that more than mere coincidence must inhere in the observation that Bateson and Goldschmidt — the most thoroughly non-Darwinian thinkers among important 20th century evolutionists, particularly as expressed in their full and coordinated support for the channeling and the facet-flipping themes of Galton's polyhedron — both insisted upon a holistic concept of genetic material).

In short, Goldschmidt finally concluded that the underlying basis for all mutational change must be sought in alterations of chromosomal patterns. If inversions, translocations, and other chromosomal changes can exert such a marked effect upon phenotypes in the absence of alteration within supposed genes, why should genes exist at all as discrete and bounded entities? Perhaps all genetic changes arise as alterations in pattern, with mappable, so-called micromutations as modifications of minimal spatial extent and phenotypic effect. (Goldschmidt, of course, did not deny the methodology of locating and mapping “genes” on chromosomes. He merely considered these loci as operationally definable spots on an indivisible chromosome. Order must be conserved for normal development. The “mutations” of conventional ter­minology must represent disruptions of this standard order, not material changes within discrete entities.) Eventually, Goldschmidt even regarded indi­vidual chromosomes as mere segments of a more comprehensive, holistically acting, system. As he touted this concept with increasing vigor and assurance, even after Watson and Crick's resolution of the structure of DNA in 1953, Goldschmidt became more and more marginalized within his field.

This idiosyncratic view of genetics bears an obvious relationship to Goldschmidt's saltational concept. If all genetic change can be rendered as alteration of pattern within a single integrated system, then some changes must be great enough in scope to reorient the entire program of development (while others, with only local effect, correspond to micromutations of standard interpretations). Goldschmidt called these pervasive changes “systemic muta­tions,” and he identified them as the underlying source of saltational events that produce new species by transcending the ineffective Darwinian diversi­fication of races:

For a long time I have been convinced that macroevolution must proceed by a different genetic method ... A pattern change in the chromosomes, completely independent of gene mutations, nay, even of the concept of the gene, will furnish this new method of macroevolution . . . So-called gene mutation and recombination within an interbreeding population may lead to a kaleidoscopic diversification within the species, which may find expression in the production of subspecific categories . . . The change from species to species is not a change involving more and more additional atomistic changes, but a complete change of the primary pattern or reaction system into a new one, which afterwards may again pro­duce intraspecific variation by micromutation. One might call this differ­ent type of genetic change a systemic mutation . . . Whatever genes or gene mutations might be, they do not enter this picture at all. Only the arrangement of the serial chemical constituents of the chromosome into a new, spatially different order, i.e., a new chromosomal pattern, is in­volved (1940, pp. 205-206).



This bold statement highlights the key issue surrounding Goldschmidt's role in current reformulations of evolutionary theory. Goldschmidt clearly ties his phenotypic concept of the “hopeful monster” to his genetic hypothe­sis of “systemic mutation” as a cause. If these two notions are indissolubly linked, and if the hopeful monster can only be conceived as a phenotypic manifestation of this deeply fallacious genetic theory, then we may dismiss this colorful term as a historical curiosity. I place Goldschmidt's denial of cor­puscular genes, and his attempt to construct a holistic genetics based upon position effects in a fully integrated interchromosomal system, into the inter­esting category of major ideas that we may honor as “gloriously wrong.” Goldschmidt made a grand, not a paltry, error — for his system proposes an entirely different way of knowing, with intellectual and scientific ramifica­tions at broadest scale. But this generous breadth of vision doesn't make Goldschmidt's genetic system any less wrong, and the obvious argument re­mains: If hopeful monsters and systemic mutations only represent two aspects of the same phenomenon, then we must place the unitary concept aside, how­ever gently and with sympathetic interest.

But even a cursory investigation of Goldschmidt's career, and a first-pass analysis of his writings, reveals a separate, older and more important theme behind the concept of the hopeful monster. Goldschmidt sets most of his macroevolutionary discussions in the context of developmental systems and their ontogenies, not of idiosyncratic genetics and their operation. The confu­sions and conflations within The Material Basis of Evolution remain both palpable and frustrating — and must be regarded as Goldschmidt's own doing (and undoing). In this book, he sometimes speaks of systemic mutations as causes of macroevolution — alterations, by chromosomal repatterning, of en­tire genetic systems. But, more often, he discusses macroevolutionary change as a consequence of alterations in developmental ontogeny. His language then becomes dramatically different. Goldschmidt now refers to the genetic basis of large, species-forming phenotypic changes as “mutations” — and he now speaks of conventional alterations at specific sites, not of holistic repatternings. He often describes these mutational changes as “small,” and he ar­gues for far-reaching consequences because genes affect rates of development, and small changes occurring early in growth can trigger cascading results throughout ontogeny. “A single mutational step affecting the right process at the right moment can accomplish everything provided that it is able to set in motion the ever-present potentialities of embryonic regulation” (1940, p. 297). These developmental themes, of course, would be regarded as inter­esting and acceptable to orthodox synthesists (however underemphasized within the traditions of this theory). “The physiological balanced system of development is such that in many cases a single upset leads automatically to a whole series of consecutive changes of development in which the ability for embryonic regulation, as well as purely mechanical and topographical mo­ments, come into play; there is in addition the shift in proper timing of inte­grating processes. If the result is not, as it frequently is, a monstrosity incapa­ble of completing development or surviving, a completely new anatomical construction may emerge in one step from such a change” (1940, p. 486).

How then shall the hopeful monster be defined: the product of an illusory systemic mutation (and therefore a chimaera to be set aside), or as the result of a small genetic change that, by working early in ontogeny, produces a sub­stantial final effect (and therefore an acceptable idea to stretch the Neo-Darwinian envelope)?

This confusion epitomizes the key issue for evaluating Goldschmidt's book, since the importance of his macroevolutionary ideas depends upon a resolu­tion. Many readers have noted and commented upon this frustration, and Goldschmidt himself remarked (1955, quoted in Frazzetta, 1975, p. 116): “I have been reproached for not having made clear in my book The Material Ba­sis of Evolution whether I was speaking of systemic mutation (scrambling of the chromosomal pattern) or of ordinary mutations of a macroevolutionary type, and of being confused myself on what I meant.”

In one sense, of course, any resolution based on Goldschmidt's own intellectual ontogeny must admit a genuine incoherence, even a contradiction, between the different parts of his book. After all, systemic mutations differ markedly from small genetic changes that cascade to large effect by acting early in ontogeny — and Goldschmidt clearly grants each phenomenon, in dif­ferent passages, the dominant role in macroevolutionary change! But I think that several persuasive arguments can be made, including the existence of a genuine literary “smoking gun,” for regarding the developmental theme as more important, both in Goldschmidt's career and in his 1940 book (even though systemic mutation, as a much more radical concept — albeit ultimately false and detrimental to his influence — became the chief obsession of Goldschmidt's old age).

1. Material Basis grants the developmental theme a clear prominence in both place and space. In his introductory pages, Goldschmidt complains that evolutionary thought suffers by disregarding a vital subject: “There is, finally, another field which has been neglected almost completely in evolutionary discussions; namely, experimental embryology. The material of evolution con­sists of hereditary changes of the organism. Any such change, however, means a definite change in the development of the organism” (pp. 5-6). “A change in the hereditary type can occur only within the possibilities and limitations set by the normal process of control of development” (p. 1).

The macroevolutionary half of the book — the search for the “other evolutionary method” behind the origin of species — cobbles two strikingly different discussions together: the first (pp. 184-250) on systemic mutation and the non-existence of the “corpuscular gene”; and the second (pp. 250-396) on constraints and opportunities of developmental systems, and the potential macroevolutionary consequences of mutations affecting early development. Goldschmidt strongly emphasized the second discussion (at more than twice the length devoted to the first theme). Moreover, he situated his entire treat­ment of hopeful monsters (pp. 390-393) within the developmental section. In the opening paragraph on hopeful monsters, Goldschmidt lists his favorite potential examples — concrescence of tail vertebrae to produce a fanlike ar­rangement of feathers in ancestral birds, the passage of both eyes to one side of the head in flatfishes, and an achondroplastic bow-legged dog that ranks as a mere monster until humans need to extract badgers from dens and therefore breed dachshunds. Goldschmidt interprets these examples entirely in terms of small mutations affecting early development. He states, following the citation of dachshunds (p. 391): “Here, then, we have another example of evolution in single large steps on the basis of shifts in embryonic processes produced by one mutation . . . This basis is furnished by the existence of mutants produc­ing monstrosities of the required type and the knowledge of embryonic deter­mination, which permits a small rate change in early embryonic processes to produce a large effect embodying considerable parts of the organism.”

2. The developmental theme pervaded Goldschmidt's career, in both dura­tion of work and centrality of focus. I mentioned above (p. 453) that Gold­schmidt centered his empirical studies upon the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar. His voluminous research on the genetics of geographic variation, pub­lished under the collective title Untersuchungen zur Genetik der geographischen Variation, convinced him that diversification within species, though Darwinian and adaptive, did not lead to the origin of new species. But Gold­schmidt pursued a second line of work on Lymantria for more than 20 years and through equally voluminous publication — studies on sexual determina­tion and intersexuality (culminating in a long series of papers collectively titled, Untersuchungen iiber Intersexualitat).

In these developmental studies, Goldschmidt recognized normal sexuality as a quantitative phenomenon produced by a balance of male and female sex determiners. He produced a series of graded intersexes by altering these bal­ances experimentally. At a time (between 1910 and 1920) when the great ma­jority of geneticists focused their work upon basic principles of transmission, Goldschmidt had already begun to study gene function and development — in order to establish a profession that he called “physiological genetics.” He rec­ognized that genes work by controlling the rates of chemical processes. Nor­mal development requires a proper balance and definite timing of substances; evolutionary change occurs by alteration in the timing of development. Gold­schmidt initiated and extended the concept of “rate genes,” and the germ of the hopeful monster clearly lies within this crucial concept of his career.

This work also led Goldschmidt to what many scientists regard as his most enduring contribution — the naming and characterization of “phenocopies.” If genes affect timing, then experimental manipulations of tempera­ture and chemical environment might induce changes identical with those found in mutants, thus confirming the rate hypothesis. Goldschmidt pro­duced such “mutant” phenotypes without mutations and christened them “phenocopies.” He maintained great fondness for this subject and for his dis­coveries in this area. Indeed, the very last words of his posthumously pub­lished autobiography (1960, p. 326) do not proffer cosmic advice, but merely state: “It is my greatest intellectual happiness that I can still work in my labo­ratory and even make interesting discoveries in the field of chemically in­duced phenocopies.”

Goldschmidt's later apostasy on macroevolution may be traced to this personal source in his early work on development, particularly to his early recognition that small genetic changes, operating early enough in ontogeny, may engender cascading effects towards a large phenotypic jump in a single ge­netic step.

3. The very term “hopeful monster,” and the form of evidence adduced by Goldschmidt in support, establishes the developmental theme as primary. Why did Goldschmidt use such an odd term at all, an apparently flippant phrase (and, therefore, a poor rhetorical strategy for pushing heterodox views) al­most guaranteed to generate rebuke from upholders of orthodox (and dull) academic prose? In part, of course, the term began in whimsy, and then flowed too far on winds of circumstance. Goldschmidt recalled in his autobi­ography (1960, p. 318): “I spoke half jokingly of the hopeful monster in my first publication on the subject.” But, in another sense, the term could not have been more apt or appropriate once one recognizes that ontogenetic de­velopment — not systemic mutation — undergirds the concept.

What makes a monster hopeful? Goldschmidt identifies two necessary and sufficient conditions:

(1) The mutant must, by good fortune, be well fitted for a particular, previously unexploited environment in its vicinity — the Darwinian, or functional theme. A mutant rat with fused tail vertebrae is just a monster; a proto-bird, with feathers better positioned for flight as a fortuitous consequence of a sim­ilar fusion, becomes a hopeful monster. An ordinary nektonic teleost fish with both eyes on one side of the head is only a monster; a benthic flatfish with both eyes on the head's upper surface, with better scanning of surroundings as a lucky result, becomes a hopeful monster. A short and bow-legged dog is merely a monster; a frankfurter that can drag badgers from their holes is a hopeful monster.

(2) More importantly, hopeful monsters must pass a developmental crite­rion. The vast majority of mutations with large phenotypic effects are le­thal — that is, just monsters. However, certain rare mutations will produce extensive, but viable, phenotypic changes because they operate within the confines of a well regulated developmental system. Such changes yield work­able organisms (which may thrive if they become lucky enough to find a wel­coming environment), rather than inviable hodge-podges of unintegrated sys­tems in varying phases of ontogeny. The fecund macroevolutionary monster becomes potentially “hopeful” when all phenotypic effects unfold in a coor­dinated manner within a regulated developmental system. In his autobio­graphical statement, just before admitting that he had originated the term “hopeful monster” in partial jest, Goldschmidt linked his concept firmly to the developmental theme: “What addition to Darwinism was needed in order to account for the macroevolutionary processes? The solution was the exis­tence of macromutations, which, in rare cases, could affect early embryonic processes so that through the features of embryonic regulation and integra­tion at once a major step in evolution could be accomplished and fixed under certain conditions” (1960, p. 318).

Invoking the classical formalist theme of constraints and channels, Goldschmidt argues that a knowledge of developmental systems and their norms of reaction can specify the range of perturbations that might yield hopeful monsters — a clear invocation of “developmental constraint” in its positive mode of enabling (see Chapter 10): “Within a constant genotype the potenti­alities of individual development may include a range of variation of the same phenotypic order of magnitude which otherwise characterizes large evolu­tionary steps based upon changes in the genotype. The norm of reaction thus shows that paths are available for changes in the genotype (mutations in the broadest sense) without upsetting normal developmental processes” (p. 260).

Goldschmidt designates this creative constraining force in the last phrase — “without upsetting normal developmental processes.” If shifts to alternate pathways discombobulate development, then any resulting monster must be hopeless. Many intricately complex systems simply fall apart or change in injurious ways under the impact of major perturbations. But the regulation of organic systems has evolved to accommodate impacts and to integrate changes into canalized and viable pathways. Goldschmidt's famous phrase transcends whimsy or nonsense — once we grasp the intended developmental theme. Goldschmidt granted hope to his monsters because regulation can integrate certain large alterations of phenotype into viable systems of devel­opment.

4. The origin and subsequent ontogeny of hopeful monsters (both the term and the concept) reveal a “smoking gun” for centrality of the developmental theme. Evolutionary biologists should honor world's fairs, despite their hoopla and crass commercialism — for Goldschmidt's work provides a second example of their spur to scientific progress. C. O. Whitman presented his most cogent defense of orthogenesis in pigeons (see pp. 383–394) in an ad­dress delivered at a meeting held in conjunction with the St. Louis fair of 1904 (also the source of the ice cream cone, several Scott Joplin rags, and the song “Meet me in St. Louis, Louis”). Richard Goldschmidt christened the term “hopeful monster” in an address at the AAAS meeting of 1933, held in conjunction with Chicago's World's Fair to celebrate a “century of progress.” Goldschmidt, representing the “Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biology, Berlin-Dahlem,” spoke on “some aspects of evolution.” In his closing paragraph (1933, p. 547), he coined the fateful term in summarizing his entire paper:

I chose ... first, an aspect where I had to express skepticism in regard to well-established beliefs. I tried to show on the basis of large experimental evidence that the formation of subspecies or geographic races is not a step towards the formation of species but only a method to allow the spreading of a species to different environments by forming preadaptational mutations and combinations of such, which, however, always remain within the confines of the species. The second aspect, which I dis­cussed, was one where I felt again optimistic. I tried to emphasize the im­portance of the methods of normal embryonic development for an un­derstanding of possible evolutionary changes. I tried to show that a directed orthogenetic evolution is a necessary consequence of the embry­onic system, which allows only certain avenues for transformation. I fur­ther emphasized the importance of rare but extremely consequential mu­tations affecting rates of decisive embryonic processes, which might give rise to what one might term hopeful monsters, monsters that could start a new evolutionary line if fitting into some empty environmental niche.



Two features of this citation (and of the whole article) clinch my argument. First, the article's structure provides an epitome for the book that Gold­schmidt would publish seven years later, and that would seal and symbolize his apostasy. The Material Basis of Evolution must have been written as an expansion of this outline — a two-part structure, with the first half (Gold­schmidt's self-styled “skepticism”) on the Darwinian character, but macro-evolutionary inefficacy, of adaptive differentiation within species; and the sec­ond half (Goldschmidt's proclaimed “optimism”) on a different style for macroevolution based on occasional saltation in a rare but viable mode, as embodied in the slightly whimsical phrase “hopeful monster.” Goldschmidt wrote the following statement in 1933, but he could not have composed better jacket copy for his 1940 book:





At the beginning of this lecture I said that my mind, like that of many geneticists, is oscillating between skepticism and optimism with regard to the views on the means of evolution as derived from genetical work. I have now presented to you examples of both states of mind: First, a bit of skepticism with regard to the role which the formation of geographic races or subspecies may have played in evolution; and then a bit of opti­mism in trying to show that the physiological system underlying orderly development, on the basis of the genetic constitution, allows some of the larger steps in evolution to be understood as sudden changes by single mutations concerning the rate of certain embryological processes (1933, p. 546).





This quotation would work as full jacket copy for Goldschmidt's later book — except for one omission. The quotation contains no statement at all, about systemic mutations or the attempt to construct a revolutionary, holistic genetics by denying the corpuscular gene. In other words, Goldschmidt devel­oped the full intellectual framework of his argument for the strict separation of micro- and macroevolution, and for the saltational basis of macroevolution, by invoking the developmental theme alone — that is, before he initiated his campaign for a revolutionary genetics (beginning in the late 1930's, and then continuing and intensifying to his death). The developmental theme en­joys both temporal priority and complete sufficiency. Goldschmidt devised the hopeful monster (both the term and concept) before he ever formulated his radical genetics. Moreover, the developmental theme can carry the argu­ment for saltational macroevolution all by itself. This conclusion, I think, re­solves the puzzle of textual confusion in The Material Basis of Evolution. Goldschmidt had constructed his outline by 1933, based on the developmen­tal theme alone. He began to formulate his radical genetics later, and then in­terpolated this material into a structure already established. These interpola­tions often seem hasty or haphazard, and Goldschmidt's chapters on systemic mutation do not always cohere with the earlier material. Ironically, the pas­sages on systemic mutation in The Material Basis work much like an ordinary “hopeless monster” in the organic world. They do not mesh with the coher­ent outline or developmental program of a book planned and coordinated long before!

In introducing the developmental theme to carry his ideas on macro­evolution, Goldschmidt (1933, p. 543) states that biologists have long recog­nized the need to understand the genetic basis and selective advantage of major evolutionary changes — but that a crucial third component has been missing: “But there is a third point, often neglected, which lies, I think, at the basis of the whole problem, namely, the nature of the developmental system of the organism which is to undergo evolutionary change.” Goldschmidt then argues that his macroevolutionary ideas arose “as a logical consequence of my views on gene controlled development” (p. 544), with a key in the con­cept of alterations in rate: “The most probable mutational change with a chance to lead to a normal organism is a change in the typical rate of certain developmental processes” (p. 544). He then praises D'Arcy Thompson for lo­cating the phyletic meaning of these ideas in small mutational changes in rates, operating early in development to yield a saltational origin of new adult phenotypes: “Translated into phylogenetic language, this would mean that immense evolutionary effects could be brought about by changing the differ­ential growth rates of the whole body or organ at an early point in develop­ment, with all the necessary secondary effects of such a change” (p. 545). In rare cases, such ontogenetic cascades will produce a viable organism (by working within developmental channels) lucky enough to find a favorable en­vironment — in other words, a hopeful monster: “We certainly know of many cases of mutational shifts of the rate of certain developmental processes lead­ing to non-viable results, for example, caterpillars with pupal antennae, lar­vae of beetles with wings . . . But I cannot see any objection to the belief that occasionally, though extremely rarely, such a mutation may act on one of the few open avenues of differentiation and actually start a new evolutionary line” (p. 544).

My pleasure in locating this resolution (in a 1933 article) for the textual difficulties in Goldschmidt's 1940 book then became enhanced when I noted another theme, by no means absent from the later book, but stressed in 1933 to a far greater extent, and with clearer purpose. I have repeatedly empha­sized, as the central notion of this chapter, that the full formalist (or internal­ist) critique of Darwinian functionalism embraces two themes, both illus­trated by Galton's incisive metaphor of the herkyjerky polyhedron — facet flipping (saltationism) and channeling (constraint in the positive sense of pre­ferred directions for change).

One might expect that the chief apostate and whipping boy of ortho­doxy would embrace the full range of a coherent opposing philosophy. We usually view Goldschmidt as a pure saltationist, and the vehemence of ortho­dox reaction to only half a loaf might seem puzzling. But in the 1933 article, Goldschmidt gives equal weight to both internalist arguments — as he repeat­edly, and explicitly, ties the theme of channeling to its strongest version of orthogenesis. Saltation and channeling march in tandem throughout his argu­ment, and the entirety builds a satisfying version of the full formalist critique.

I have already cited one Goldschmidtian invocation of orthogenesis linked to saltationism, from the concluding paragraph: “I tried to show that a di­rected orthogenetic evolution is a necessary consequence of the embryonic system which allows only certain avenues for transformation” (p. 547). But the two themes remain indissolubly connected throughout the article, and channeling receives as much attention as saltation — whereas Goldschmidt did emphasize saltation and downplay channeling in his later writings. In fact, in the 1933 article, Goldschmidt invokes channeling at the very begin­ning of his macroevolutionary discussion, just after citing the importance of development and even before he introduces the argument for saltation:

A considerable number of developmental processes between egg and adult have to be changed, in order to lead to a different organization. Development, however, within a species is, we know, considerably one tracked. The individual developmental processes are so carefully interwoven and arranged so orderly in time and space that the typical result is only possible if the whole process of development is in any single case set in motion and carried out upon the same material basis.* Changes in this developmental system leading to new stable forms are only possible as far as they do not destroy or interfere with the orderly progress of developmental processes (p. 543).



The explicit invocation of orthogenesis then follows (p. 544): “If there are only a few avenues free for the action of mutational changes without knock­ing out of order the whole properly balanced system of reactions, the proba­bility is exceedingly high that repeated mutations will go in the same direc­tion, will be orthogenetic . . . We have pointed out a long time ago and still hold that orthogenesis is not the result of the action of selection or of a mysti­cal trend, but a necessary consequence of the way in which the genes control orderly development — a way which makes only a few directions available to mutational changes.”

Only now, after explicating the theme of channeling, does Goldschmidt introduce the rationale for saltation in its context: “But how about the possibil­ity of occasional successful mutational changes acting upon earlier develop­mental processes? Would such a change, if possible at all without breaking up the whole system of the orderly sequence of development, not at once have the consequence of changing the whole organization and bridging with one step the gap between taxonomically widely different forms?” (p. 544).

Thereafter, as in the summary statement cited previously, Goldschmidt combines the two themes. He conjectures, for example, how saltation and orthogenesis might jointly explain phyletic sequences of limb rudimentation:

Let us assume a mutational change in rate of differentiation of the limb-bud of a vertebrate . . . The consequent rudimentation of the organ would probably not interfere with orderly development of the organ­ism. Here, then, an avenue would be open to considerable evolutionary change with a single basic step, provided that the new form could stand the test of selection, and that a proper environmental niche could be found to which the newly formed monstrosity would be preadapted and where, once occupied, other mutations might improve the new type. And in addition, the possibility for an orthogenetic line of limb-rudimentation would be a further consequence.



In the extensive reading required to compose a chapter like this, one acquires great respect for rare scientists with the mental power, and basic thoughtfulness, to explore and integrate the full set of implications and rami­fications within great themes — and formalist vs. functionalist thinking must rank among the greatest of all biological themes (if only because this contrast expresses an attitude towards nature so deep and basic that the most impor­tant watershed in the history of biology — the development and acceptance of evolutionary theory — did not disrupt the discussion, but only reclothed an old antithesis in new language and causality).

In the post-Darwinian debates, I feel that only four evolutionists in my study fully plumbed the depth of this dichotomy (Galton specified all the themes, and even developed the canonical metaphor of the polyhedron, but he was only dipping): C. O. Whitman, Hugo de Vries, William Bateson, and Richard Goldschmidt. The views of these four men embody important dif­ferences, and Goldschmidt emerges as the best standard bearer for the full version of formalism. Two of the four embraced one aspect of Galton's poly­hedron, but rejected the other for interesting reasons: Whitman as an orthogeneticist and gradualist; and de Vries as a saltationist who accepted the isotropy of species-level variation (and therefore constructed a higher-level Darwinism for trends among species). Bateson understood the connection and brought the themes together, but his generation hadn't gained enough knowledge about potential mechanisms to suggest more than an abstract and speculative synthesis. (Interestingly, Goldschmidt begins his 1933 article, his best presentation of the full critique, with a reference to Bateson's famous 1914 address to the British Association.)

Richard Goldschmidt understood all the connections and, however flawed the result, developed a coherent theory for a full internalist alternative to gradualist and Darwinian functionalism, a view that integrated both themes — facet-flipping and channeling — of Galton's polyhedron. Gold­schmidt became the chief focus for vocal opposition by the synthesists, a sym­bol for all the bad old ways of outdated, typological thinking. I do not write to defend his specific ideas. The particulars of his genetic theory were deeply wrong, and disproved even in his lifetime, though he would not change his commitments. But I do maintain that his fully articulated critique remains as powerful as ever, and must be integrated with Darwinian orthodoxy to form a true and higher synthesis. In choosing Goldschmidt as the focus of their de­rision, the synthesists selected the right person for the best reason of all: Goldschmidt developed and fully understood all pieces of the critique, and he knew how the arguments cohered. Does the best fit always survive?

We need iconoclasts, if only to keep us thinking and probing. At the end of the Two Minutes Hate in 1984, Emmanuel Goldstein's “hostile figure melted into the face of Big Brother, . . . full of power and mysterious calm, and so vast that it almost filled up the screen. Nobody heard what Big Brother was saying. It was merely a few words of encouragement, the sort of words that are uttered in the din of a battle, not distinguishable individually but restor­ing confidence by the fact of being spoken.” Ignorance is not strength.
