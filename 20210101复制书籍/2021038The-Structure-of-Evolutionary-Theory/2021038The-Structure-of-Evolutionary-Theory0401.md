Pre-Darwinian Alternatives

to Functionalism





Prologue: Darwin's Fateful Decision





Thinking in dichotomies may be the most venerable (and ineluctable) of all human mental habits. In his Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers (circa A.D. 200), Diogenes Laertius wrote: “Protagoras asserted that there were two sides to every question, exactly opposite to each other.”

Darwin follows this tradition of dichotomy in a passage that he earmarked for special impact as the concluding paragraph of his crucial Chapter 6, “Difficulties on Theory.” I regard this passage as among the most important and portentous in the entire Origin, for these words embody Darwin's ulti­mate decision to construct a functionalist theory based on adaptation as pri­mary, and to relegate the effects of constraint (a subject that also commanded his considerable interest — see Section IV of this chapter) to a periphery of low relative frequency and subsidiary importance. Yet this passage, which should be emblazoned into the consciousness of all evolutionary biologists, has rarely been acknowledged or quoted. Darwin begins (1859, p. 206), ex­pressing his alternatives in upper case (and using the categories of the great debate between Cuvier and Geoffroy — see Section III of this chapter): “It is generally acknowledged that all organic beings have been formed on two great laws — Unity of Type, and the Conditions of Existence.”

Conditions of Existence, of course, express the principle of adaptation — final cause or teleology to pre-evolutionists. Organisms are well designed for their immediate modes of life — and intricate adaptation implies an agent of design, either an intelligent creator who made organisms by fiat as an expres­sion of his wisdom and benevolence, or a natural principle of evolution that yields such adjustment between organism and environment as a primary re­sult of its operation. (Both Darwinian natural selection and Lamarckian re­sponse to perceived needs, for example, build adaptation as the most general consequence of their basic mode of action.)

Darwin then continues by defining the other side of the classical dichot­omy: Unity of Type (1859, p. 206): “By unity of type is meant that fundamental agreement in structure, which we see in organic beings of the same class, and which is quite independent of their habits of life.” In another critically placed passage, introducing the subject of “Morphology” in Chapter 13, Darwin waxes almost poetic about unity of type (p. 434): “This is the most interesting department of natural history, and may be said to be its very soul. What can be more curious than that the hand of a man, formed for grasping, that of a mole for digging, the leg of the horse, the paddle of the porpoise, and the wing of the bat, should all be constructed on the same pattern, and should include the same bones in the same relative proportions.”

These two principles have always dwelled together in exquisite tension. Any complete account of morphology must call upon both phenomena, for most organisms are well adapted to their immediate environments, but also built on anatomical ground plans that transcend any particular circumstance. Yet the two principles seem opposed in a curious sense — for why should structures adapted for particular ends root their basic structure in homologies that do not now express any common function (as in Darwin's example of mammalian forelimbs)?

The designation of one principle or the other as the causal foundation of biology virtually defines the position of any scientist towards the organic world and its causes of order (see, especially, Russell's superb 1916 book on this dichotomy). Shall we regard the plan of high-level taxonomic order as primary, with local adaptation viewed as a set of minor wrinkles (often con­fusing) upon an abstract majesty? Or do local adaptations build the entire system from the bottom up? This dichotomy set the major debate of pre-Darwinian biology: does God reveal himself in nature primarily by the harmony of taxonomic structure, or by the intricacies of particular adaptations (see Section II, this chapter)? This dichotomy continues to define a major issue in modern evolutionary debates: does functional adaptation or structural con­straint maintain priority in setting evolutionary pathways and directions (see Chapters 10–11)?

This issue of primacy between the two principles has held the central stage of natural history for so long that national traditions have developed, with continental preferences usually emphasizing unity of type (despite important exceptions like Georges Cuvier), and mainstream anglophonic science gener­ally favoring adaptation (with exceptions for a few important pluralists like Richard Owen, or dissenters like William Bateson or D'Arcy Thompson). We often blunder in our historical understanding by assuming that evolution must be an ultimate watershed, marking a complete break between a bad be­fore and an enlightened after. In fact, much continuity pass right through Darwin's rupture of history, with evolution only providing a different expla­nation for unaltered principles and phenomena. The good ship Dichotomy — Unity of Type vs. Conditions of Existence — entered the Darwinian current by converting its terms from a debate about God's primary mode of self-expression in nature to an argument about constraint and adaptation in evolution.

We cannot understand Darwin without grasping this fundamental continuity in national styles. As a young man, Darwin adored Paley's Natural Theol­ogy (see p. 116); later, in a courageous act of intellectual parricide, he con­structed a theory that subverted Paley's mode of explanation. But Darwin never abandoned Paley's conviction that adaptation must be designated as the primary phenomenon of natural history. Darwin remained true to an English tradition stretching at least as far back as Robert Boyle and John Ray in the late 17th century of Newton's founding generation for modern science, run­ning through Paley, the Bridgewater Treatises, Wallace, and Poulton in Dar­win's own time, on to R. A. Fisher and finally to E. B. Ford, A. J. Cain, and R. Dawkins in the later 20th century.

When we properly place Darwin in this lineage, a genealogy unfractured by evolutionary theory, we can make sense of his fateful decision for resolving Unity of Type vs. Conditions of Existence at the end of Chapter 6 — a choice faithful to Paley and the English tradition in reaffirming the primacy of adap­tation. Darwin writes, in words that define the causal basis of his theory (and continuing from the previous quotation on p. 25):

On my theory, unity of type is explained by unity of descent. The expression of conditions of existence, so often insisted on by the illustrious Cuvier, is fully embraced by the principle of natural selection. For natu­ral selection acts by either now adapting the varying parts of each being to its organic and inorganic conditions of life; or by having adapted them during long-past periods of time: the adaptations being aided in some cases by use and disuse, being slightly affected by the direct action of the external conditions of life, and being in all cases subjected to the several laws of growth. Hence, in fact, the law of the Conditions of Existence is the higher law; as it includes, through the inheritance of former adapta­tions, that of Unity of Type (1859, p. 206).



Darwin's brilliant intellectual move clearly expresses the revolutionary im­pact of evolutionary explanations against the previous range of creationist paradigms. Creationist biology saw Unity of Type and Conditions of Exis­tence, homology and adaptation, as opposite, but equally contemporary (or timeless), poles in a dichotomy of originating forces. Darwin literally added a new dimension to the debate — the axis of history. (And no intellectual expan­sion can be more profound than the introduction of a new dimension, or­thogonal to previous modes of explanation.)

Thus, in this passage, Darwin makes a stunningly simple suggestion to break the impasse between Unity of Type and Conditions of Existence. (And yet, to be able to see anything at all in this clear and simple light, one must first grasp the revolutionary implications of evolution itself — the truly dif­ficult intellectual transition out of Paley's world!) To be sure, the homologies of Unity of Type do not embody, and seem actively to oppose, current func­tions. Must Unity of Type therefore represent a principle of order dichotomously contrary to adaptation? In a world without history, where all features of organisms express their initially created state, the answer must be “yes.” But the addition of history, by a theory of genealogical connection, permits (and even privileges) another interpretation. Suppose that Unity of Type re­cords no mysterious groundplan of created design, but only the actual, re­tained form of a common ancestor at the base of a bush of descent? Then homology can be simply explained as passive retention in the genealogy of diversified descendants — not an archetype of intelligent design, but only the signature of history.

In this context of evolutionary reform, we may then inquire about the causes of these common ancestral structures in distant pasts. And Darwin now makes his fundamental choice by affirming fealty to the English lineage of adaptationist thought. He argues that ancestral structures, forming the great homologies of Unity of Type, initially arose, by natural selection, as adaptations to “organic and inorganic conditions of life” in ancestral envi­ronments. Thus, the dichotomous poles of Unity of Type and Conditions of Existence achieve a single and unified explanation under natural selection — as immediate adaptations to present environments (Conditions of Existence), or as adaptations to ancient environments, transmitted by inheritance to diversified descendants (Unity of Type). The old dichotomy, in fact, expresses no clash of opposites at all, but only marks the temporally sequential repre­sentations of one dominant principle in evolution — adaptation by natural selection. Thus, since adaptation embodies the principle of Conditions of Ex­istence, and since adaptation builds both ends of the old dichotomy, Condi­tions of Existence becomes the victorious pole of the old contrast, in Darwin's own words the “higher law; as it includes, through the inheritance of former adaptations, that of Unity of Type.”

Yet Darwin, far too sophisticated a thinker to embrace extreme positions, could not claim that natural selection and adaptation — though responsible for both poles of the old dichotomy — reigned exclusively in nature. Darwin knew that primary judgments in natural history must be rendered in terms of relative frequencies. Indeed, he had written as his last line in the Introduction to the Origin of Species, first edition: “I am convinced that Natural Selection has been the main but not exclusive means of modification” (1859, p. 6). He also reacted as strongly as his genial temperament ever permitted against those who charged him with false claims of exclusivity. In such cases, he usu­ally cited this line from the Origin in vindication — as in his famous, almost rueful statement (Origin, 6th ed., 1872b, p. 395): “As my conclusions have lately been much misrepresented, and it has been stated that I attribute the modification of species exclusively to natural selection, I may be permitted to remark that in the first edition of this work, and subsequently, I placed in a most conspicuous position — namely, at the close of the Introduction the fol­lowing words: 'I am convinced that natural selection has been the main but not the exclusive means of modification.' This has been of no avail. Great is the power of steady misrepresentation.”

Thus, while extending natural selection to cover both poles of the old dichotomy between unity of type and conditions of existence, Darwin also listed the main supplements to selection among causes of evolutionary change: use and disuse, direct action of external conditions, and laws of growth. We reject the first two today, and Darwin also grants them little space by his qualifiers: “in some cases” and “being slightly affected.” But Darwin put more store by the third — laws of growth — as indicated by his only positive qualifier: “being in all cases subjected to the several laws of growth.” And we would offer the same judgment today, since laws of growth, under the more fashionable designation of “developmental constraints,” have become a “hot topic” in evolutionary biology once again (see Chapter 10). And now we come to the Darwinian trope of argument, the ploy that makes this chapter (and, to a large extent, this entire book) necessary.

Darwin wrote his crucial closing paragraph of Chapter 6 to argue that Unity of Type should be subsumed under Conditions of Existence — for Unity of Type, he asserted, only expresses past episodes of ordinary adaptation and natural selection, subsequently inherited by numerous modern descen­dants. Unity of Type has always defined the main arena for naturalists who view adaptation as secondary, and some principle of morphological order (for many versions exist) as primary. Darwin removed the rationale for a sep­arate principle of Unity of Type by noting that ancient adaptations would, if inherited throughout a subsequent lineage, become sources of deep homology. Yet he could not deny — and had no desire to subvert — the idea of mor­phological principles working separately from natural selection, and build­ing exceptions to adaptation. In this sense, Darwin supported the concept of constraint, but only if this principle could be carefully circumscribed within a category distinctly subsidiary to natural selection in relative frequency and biological importance. Darwin fully understood the crucial role of relative frequency in evolutionary arguments, and he rested his case for natural selec­tion squarely upon such a judgment of quantitative importance. In so do­ing, he pursued the following strategy: take the old dichotomy, and show that both poles arise as products of natural selection. Then, having removed constraint as the primary cause of one pole (where a high relative fre­quency could not have been denied), allow constraint to reenter as a subsid­iary force to natural selection (with a consequent guarantee of low relative frequency). Natural selection then becomes the primary force of evolution. Recall the full title of Darwin's book: On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life.

The classical form of a relative frequency argument upholds a favored position and then degrades an alternative by two strategies, both used by Darwin in making constraint subservient to natural selection.

Nooks and crannies. Argue that your principle works nearly all the time, while the alternative occupies just a few subordinate holes of absence. By attributing both poles of the classic dichotomy (unity of type and condi­tions of existence) to natural selection as a primary cause, thereby robbing constraint of its potentially largest domain, Darwin granted dominance to adaptation.

Sequelae. Argue that your principle works as a prior and primary cause (in both temporal order and effect), and that the alternative only produces secondary modifications upon this fundamental action. In the closing para­graph of Chapter 6, all forces other than selection become sequelae to its pri­mary action.*

Thus, Darwin invoked relative frequency to uphold his evolutionary world view: a theory of trial-and-error externalism, with natural selection as the only major creative force for change, and with internal variation restricted to the role of generating raw material for selection's perusal, and not of supply­ing important or consistent direction. Why, then, do many evolutionary biol­ogists continue to demur? Darwin's basic argument in closing Chapter 6 can only be judged both brilliant and undoubtedly correct. Most homologies of Unity of Type are, indeed, adaptations inherited from a distant past, not fod­der for constraint theorists who wish to demote the relative frequency and importance of natural selection. (Homologies of Unity of Type do act as phyletic constraints upon present possibilities — elephants will never fly — but such current limitations exist as consequences of initial adaptations, and therefore cannot stand against natural selection in any toting of relative fre­quencies.)

Modern constraint theorists, myself included, balk at Darwin's resolution because his argument demotes a large chunk of biology to a chink in a corner. The old Unity of Type theorists, lacking the alternative of “just history,” did falsely assume that deep homology must stand against adaptation. But much validity still attends their cardinal insight that principles of design, laws of growth, rules of architecture, nature of materials — generalities transcend­ing the particulars of specific genealogical pathways — work as important in­terior channels of constraint in the positive sense of that undervalued word: for constraints not only prevent evolutionary motion by failing to supply variation; they also act positively to set preferred channels of change. Inter­nal forces do not only present isotropic raw material to the fully creative externality of natural selection. Constraint does not exist in subservience to adaptation under the nooks-and-crannies and sequelae arguments of relative frequency. Constraint may never again (and rightly so) be able to claim primacy, as the old Unity of Type theorists held, but partnership with adaptation remains a reasonable and minimal demand.

We may epitomize Darwin's brilliant reconstruction of causation in natural history, the new dimension that he added, and the one that we need to rein­sert, in diagrammatic form. Pre-evolutionary theorists, entirely lacking the concept of historical change, attributed created form to a dichotomous dis­tinction of causes: immediate and functional vs. deeper and architectural (Fig. 4-1). Darwin literally added the dimension of history, but removed a previous axis of explanation by redefining constraints of Unity of Type as conse­quences of past adaptation (ancient Conditions of Existence) — Figure 4-2. Yet Darwin understood that he had not abolished the concept of constraint in undermining the primary example — homologies of Unity of Type — by real-location to the opposite camp. He therefore, in the same passage, established a different domain for constraint, as a category subservient to adaptation by the two standard arguments of relative frequency: the spatial claim of lim­ited room (nooks and crannies) and the temporal claim of secondary status (sequelae to adaptation) — see Figure 4-3.





4-1. The standard pre-evolutionary and dichotomous conception of the causes of form as working either by adaptation to immediate conditions of existence, or by manifestation of laws of form that reflect unity of type.





4-2. Darwin literally adds a third dimension of history for the explanation of form. But he greatly devalues the domain previously ascribed to unity of type, admitting constraints of laws of form only by redefining such similarities as homologies based on the inheritance of past adaptations, and therefore adaptational in their origin and primarily due to the other (and now predominant) do­main of conditions of existence.





But many 19th century biologists, and many evolutionists in our day again, feel that Darwin demoted constraint too far, and that the two domains — con­straint and adaptation — must again share potential partnership, as expressed by the important relative frequency of each component. We would therefore restore the strength of the dimension that Darwin first eliminated (when he reinterpreted Unity of Type as a consequence of adaptation) and then reintroduced in weakened form (when he allowed laws of growth to fill nooks and crannies in a domain ruled by natural selection) — see Figure 4-4.

This full model of Figure 4-4 shows three dimensions of form and their interactions: adaptation, constraint, and history. A current trait of an organism may arise as an immediate adaptation to surrounding environments, as a con­straint not particular to the contingent history of its lineage (architectural or structural principles, correlations to current adaptations), or by inheritance of an ancestral form (often called historical or phylogenetic constraint, but quite different in principle from nonhistorical styles of constraint). This dis­tinction suggests a recursion, because contributions from the axis of “history”

represent traits that, at their origin in an ancestor, arose as either adap­tations or constraints. Nonetheless, the immediate form of an organism can still be meaningfully parsed into three major contributions of current adapta­tion, current constraint, and historical inheritance — Figure 4-5. This insight has generated the various “triangular” models of evolutionary causation that have gained vogue in recent years (see Fig. 4-6).

These issues and parsings have pervaded natural history since Plato and Aristotle argued about abstract form vs. teleology. Darwin made a seminal

contribution by adding a dimension for history, and by formulating a theory that granted controlling relative frequency to adaptation. But he did not in­vent the issues, or the scheme of classification. The triumph of Darwinian functionalism did, however, erase much historical memory for the old alter­native of constraint. The next two chapters sink their rationale in a simple premise: Our current need to reinvigorate constraint as a vital topic in evolu­tionary explanation (see Stearns, 1986; Maynard Smith et al., 1985; Gould, 1989a, 1992b) — based upon advancing knowledge of genetic architecture, development and macroevolution — requires that we rediscover this legacy of structuralist thought,* and recognize that the entire history of evolutionary theory has been pervaded by an issue that simply would not disappear, if only because the dialectic of inside and outside, structure and function, design and adaptation, must be resolved at some fascinating interplay and synthesis, not as a victory for either pole in a debate without true sides.





Two Ways to Glorify God in Nature





We cannot comprehend the past from the vantage point of a newly constructed present reality. Once the 19th century had discovered evolution as the primary cause of relationships among organisms, the historical axis not only sprang into being as a pole of explanation, but quickly assumed a pri­mary status (Figs. 4-2 to 4-6). More than a century later, we can hardly imag­ine biology without this theme. What kind of questions could be posed be­fore history became an option for resolution? What kinds of explanations could be rendered when a biologist couldn't ask (or even conceptualize): “How has this feature changed from an ancestral state; what do its differing forms in various species tell us about phyletic relationships; what are the causal bases for both the origin and later alterations of this feature?”

Immediate appearance in a fully formed state provides the only alternative to history — whether such “creation” is achieved by the direct hand of a di­vine agent, or by spontaneous organization from elements according to some unknown law or principle of nature. If basic taxa originated as we find them now, then the range of theoretical explanation remains wide. Species might be purposely ill designed to suit the black humor of a diabolical creator; or they might be cobbled together with no rhyme or reason by forces of universal randomness. The list of possibilities continues ad infinitum.

But, in fact, Western cultural traditions greatly limited the range of acceptable alternatives. Very few creationists could imagine that species might be purposely ill formed, or constructed in a disorganized fashion. With these at­tributes — purpose and order — as part of a cultural heritage, the basic expla­nations for organic form could be reduced to two major alternatives, express­ing the primacy of one or the other overarching principle for a rational and benevolent world. These principles have been called structuralism and functionalism, order and teleology, laws of form and adaptation, Unity of Type and Conditions of Existence. These poles set the dichotomy that Darwin ex­panded by introducing history (see last section), but never really fractured be­cause the new axis of time could also be divided into structural vs. functional explanations for ancestral forms. This dichotomy continues to set an impor­tant agenda for evolutionary theory at the opening of a new millennium, especially since the overly adaptationist Modern Synthesis (representing a temporary triumph of the functionalist pole — see Chapter 7) has yielded to a pluralism of structuralist alternatives as partners rather than subsidiary forces (Chapters 10 and 11).

In this light, I find it fascinating that the oldest tradition in modern natural history — the natural theology of so many pre-Darwinian biologists* — also existed in two primary versions, expressing the two poles of the same dichot­omy. Since Darwin built his evolutionary theory in continuity with the pole favored by a long English heritage — the adaptationism of William Paley — this subject cannot be dismissed as an arcane issue from a forgotten past, but re­mains a vital presence in our daily concerns (by our own fundamental evolu­tionary criterion of genealogy and phyletic heritage!). For we still struggle with adaptation and constraint just as Paley and Agassiz contrasted the com­parable positions in natural theology: “the creator foresaw the needs of each species and created just those organs that were necessary to carry them out” vs. “God had in the beginning established laws, and nature was left to unfold in accordance with them” (characterizations of Appel, 1987, p. 7). Do not Fisher vs. Wright, or Cain and Maynard Smith vs. Goodwin and Kauffman carry on the same debate, evolutionarily transmogrified of course?

Natural theology held, as a central premise, that the works of nature not only demonstrated God's presence, but could also reveal his character as well. We could learn about him, not only persuade ourselves that he exists. Paley's full title (1802) reads: Natural Theology: or, Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity, Collected from the Appearances of Nature. From this shared premise, two traditions proceeded, both “preadapted” to a later evo­lutionary transformation.

In this section I shall contrast the two great texts of these alternative traditions — Paley's Natural Theology (1802) with Agassiz's Essay on Classification (1857). The two works dovetail with remarkable symmetry in their op­position: Paley the British adaptationist vs. Agassiz the continental formalist. One might almost believe that the two works were explicitly written to flesh out (and fully clothe) the central dichotomy of form, with each awarded ex­actly half the totality. In a curious sense, this lack of contact almost allows the two texts to speak to each other — as if they formed a sand painting with one (Paley for temporal priority) filling in half the area up to an elaborate and jag­ged boundary, and the other then pouring sand of a different color right up to the previous boundary, leaving no space between at the contact. I am puzzled that these two texts have not been explicitly contrasted before.





WILLIAM PALEY AND BRITISH FUNCTIONALISM: PRAISING GOD IN THE DETAILS OF DESIGN





Just a few years before Paley wrote his Natural Theology in 1802, Coleridge's Ancient Mariner (1798) proclaimed his hard-won message to a wedding feast, and to the world:





He prayeth best, who loveth best

All things both great and small;

For the dear God who loveth us,

He made and loveth all.





Paley probably appreciated the sentiments and surely longed to extend the argument. He entertained no doubt that all things proclaimed God's existence. But he believed that we must be able to learn more if we hope to use natural theology as a strategy of exegesis. That is, we must also be able to infer im­portant aspects of God's nature and character from the works of creation.

The search to infer God's attributes from general features of natural objects led Paley to open his book with one of the most famous images in all English literature — a strong competitor with Adam Smith's “invisible hand” (a line also found in Paley, 1803, p. 344) and Darwin's tangled bank or tree of life. The good Reverend, crossing a heath on shank's mare, bumps his foot against a stone, feels the pain, but learns nothing about the origin of rocks because the object is too simple and too disordered to reveal a source of production. But if he should then kick a watch, he would surely know that the timepiece had been fashioned by a purposeful agent:

When we come to inspect the watch, we perceive (what we could not discover in the stone) that its several parts are framed and put together for a purpose, e.g. that they are formed and adjusted as to produce motion, and that motion so regulated as to point out the hour of the day... The inference, we think, is inevitable; that the watch must have had a maker; that there must have existed, at some time and at some place or other, an artificer or artificers who formed it for the purpose which we find it actually to answer; who comprehended its construction, and designed its use (Paley, 1803, p. 203 — I am using my personal copy of the widely read 1803 edition for all quotes).



Two features of the watch compel this conclusion. First, and less impor­tant, its complexity — for chance could not make anything so intricate: “What does chance ever do for us? In the human body, for instance, chance, i.e. the operation of causes without design, may produce a wen, or a wart, a mole, a pimple, but never an eye” (1803, pp. 67-68). Second, and far more impor­tant, the watch's design, its adaptation to a clearly perceived end.* A high de­gree of order might arise from laws of nature with no reference to final cause, but complexity for a clear purpose implies a designer. “There cannot be de­sign without a designer; contrivance without a contriver; arrangement, with­out anything capable of arranging” (p. 12). Thus does Paley attack his hypo­thetical opponent and partial straw man throughout his work? * “Nor would any man in his senses think the existence of the watch, with its various ma­chinery, accounted for, by being told that it was one out of several possible combinations of material forms; that whatever he had found in the place where he found the watch, must have contained some internal configuration or other; and that this configuration might be the structure now exhibited” (p. 6).

The watch implies, by its utility, a mind capable of forethought, design and construction: “In the watch which we are examining, are seen contrivance, design; an end, a purpose; means for the end, adaptation to the purpose. And the question, which irresistibly presses upon our thoughts, is, whence this contrivance and design. The thing required is the intending mind, the adapt­ing hand, the intelligence by which that hand was directed” (p. 16).

But organisms surely display more complexity and more purposeful design than any watch. Just as Darwin would exalt natural selection as vastly more powerful than artificial human selection in breeding or agriculture, so does Paley identifies God's work as incomparably superior to any human art. If the existence of the watch implies a skilled craftsman, how can we even conceive the more awesome skill of he who made all living things: “For every indica­tion of contrivance, every manifestation of design, which existed in the watch, exists in the work of nature; with the difference, on the side of nature, of being greater and more, and that in a degree which exceeds all computa­tion” (p. 19).

In succinct epitome of the entire argument, Paley writes (p. 473): “The marks of design are too strong to be got over. Design must have a designer. That designer must have been a person. That person is God.”

Since we often misuse the past for ridicule, Paley has emerged as every­body's favorite whipping boy from the bad old days of creationism. As a lively writer, he is, to be sure, eminently quotable. And he does sometimes stray into the kind of Panglossian perfectionism (or, rather, far-fetched ratio­nalization for beneficence within apparent evil) that Voltaire savaged with such glee in Candide.

Paley, for example, does engage in “just-so” storytelling to support adaptationist explanation, though he presumably read this account of Babyrussa in a fallacious traveler’s report, and can only be charged with insufficient skep­ticism, not fabrication (Fig. 4-7):

I shall add one more example for the sake of its novelty. It is always an agreeable discovery, when, having remarked in an animal an extraordi­nary structure, we come at length to find out an unexpected use for it. The following narrative furnishes an instance of this kind. The baby-rouessa, or Indian hog, a species of wild boar found in the East Indies, has two bent teeth, more than half a yard long, growing upwards, and (which is the singularity) from the upper jaw. These instruments are not wanted for defense, that service being provided for by two tusks issuing from the under jaw, and resembling those of the common boar. Nor does the animal use them for defense. They might seem therefore to be both





4-7. Paley does not include a drawing of the skull of Babyrussa, but this figure comes from an equally interesting source — P. H. Gosse's Omphalos of 1857, his treatise arguing for the sudden and recent creation of the Earth, including all its fossils, which therefore only display an appearance of great age.





a superfluity and an incumbrance. But observe the event. The animal sleeps standing; and, in order to support its head, hooks its upper tusks on the branches of trees (pp. 270-271).



More in the Panglossian mode, pain (an adaptation, Paley argues, for signaling distress to the mind so that we may care for our bodies) also shows God's benevolence on the theme of the old moron joke — we feel so good when the suffering stops! (On the subject of good in apparent noxiousness, compare John Ray (1735, p. 309) on why God made lice: “I cannot but look upon the strange instinct of this noisome and troublesome creature a louse, of searching out foul and nasty clothes to harbor and breed in, as an effect of divine providence, designed to deter men and women from sluttishness and sordidness, and to provoke them to cleanliness and neatness. God Himself hateth uncleanliness, and turns away from it.” Or, as Robert Burns would later generalize the lesson in “To a Louse”: “Oh wad some power the giftie gie us / To see oursels as ithers see us!”) “A man resting from a fit of the stone or gout, is, for the time, in possession of feelings which undisturbed health cannot impart. They may be dearly bought, but still they are to be set against the price. And, indeed, it depends upon the duration and urgency of the pain, whether they be dearly bought by suffering a moderate interruption of bodily ease for a couple of hours out of the four and twenty” (pp. 523-533).

To complete the picture of joyous nature made by a loving God, signs of non-utility in sheer behavioral exuberance, particularly in the play of young creatures, testify to the sheer pleasure of being alive on such a wondrous planet:

Swarms of newborn flies are trying their pinions in the air. Their sportive motions, their wanton mazes, their gratuitous activity, their continual change of place without use or purpose, testify their joy, and the exulta­tion which they feel in their lately discovered faculties . . . Other species are running about with an alacrity in their motions which carries with it every mark of pleasure. Large patches of ground are sometimes half cov­ered with these brisk and sprightly natures. If we look to what the waters produce, shoals of the fry of fish frequent the marshes of rivers, of lakes, and of the sea itself. These are so happy, that they know not what to do with themselves (pp. 490-491).



(Paley's prose may be purple, but his purpose is sanguine. He argues, in stat­ing his primary case, that organic adaptation proves the personhood of God. But we want to know more. God could, after all, be a consummate crafts­man, but a crabby character. Paley's arguments on pain and natural happiness indicate that God is not only skillful, but also benevolent as well.)

These statements, taken out of context (as usually done), promote an un­fair caricature of a subtle argument. Paley cannot be dismissed as an intellec­tual slouch. His Evidences of Christianity (1794) remained a required text for entrance to Cambridge University until the 20th century, and Darwin would never have chosen a cardboard dogmatist for a hero or, later, for an opponent worthy of overturning as the essential thrust of a revolutionary theory (see pp. 116–125). Paley's totality presents a subtle, coherently reasoned brief for an adaptationist natural theology.

First of all, Paley cannot be caricatured as a Panglossian perfectionist. He states explicitly that we cannot use perfection as a criterion for identifying good design, or even as the necessary mark of divinity in craftsmanship: “It is not necessary that a machine be perfect, in order to show with what design it was made: still less necessary, where the only question is, whether it were made with any design at all” (p. 5).

Paley also provides, if only occasionally, positive arguments for imperfec­tion, as in feathers of an ostrich's wing. “The filaments hang loose and sepa­rate from one another, forming only a kind of down; which constitution of the feathers, however it may fit them for the flowing honors of a lady's head­dress, may be reckoned an imperfection in the bird, inasmuch as wings, com­posed of these feathers, although they may greatly assist in running, do not serve for flight” (p. 236). And he acknowledges that the creator's preference for utility lies revealed in the overwhelming relative frequency, not the ubiq­uity, of adaptation (but adding the conventional rider, still commonly ad­vanced today, that, if we look hard enough, we will discover uses for traits now judged “nonadaptive”). “Instances . . . where the part appears to be to­tally useless, I believe to be extremely rare: compared with the number of those, of which the use is evident, they are beneath any assignable propor­tions; and perhaps, have never been submitted to a trial and examination suf­ficiently accurate, long enough continued, or often enough repeated” (Paley, 1803, p. 64).

In fact, Paley uses adaptationism primarily as a theoretical argument about depth of causality, not as an excuse to rhapsodize about happy nature. Oppo­nents who wish to see “physical law” as the source of form might cite sexual generation and embryology as leading examples. But these processes only provide the immediate physical continuity of efficient causation: “The truth is, generation is not a principle but a process” (p. 453). We need a deeper rea­son, a true principle, for the evident adaptation of form to function — in short, a final cause. Even if watches gave birth to new watches, Paley argues, we would not identify ontogeny as the ultimate source of timekeeping. Neither can embryology be the cause of optical excellence in the human eye, if only because “things generated possess a clear relation to things not generated” (p. 455) — the eye to external light and to the objects we need to see in this case. (We now recognize this otherwise persuasive argument as wrong only because life, unbeknownst to Paley, possesses history and mutability.)

But the main case for taking Paley seriously lies in his formulation and refutation of opposing visions. Anyone can spin out a rationale for an idée fixe, but a well-crafted system requires both full analysis and principled denial of alternatives. Natural Theology merits our respect, and becomes a key docu­ment for this chapter on the history of functionalism vs. formalism, because Paley recognized the structuralist alternative and provided a coherent defense. His arguments span two chapters (15 on relations and 16 on compen­sations), treating the phenomenon always viewed as crucial and primary by advocates of structural constraint — stable correlations among parts of the body.

Since Paley's main argument holds that intricate contrivance implies a contriver, two main rebuttals might be offered in principle: (1) the adaptations exist, but they originated by a natural process of evolution, not by creative acts of a deity; (2) organisms were created, but adaptation does not permeate or even dominate their form.

Since Paley never imagined the alternative of natural change by selection or weeding out, he confines his refutation of adaptive evolution to the “Lamarckian” principle of use and disuse. (I doubt that Paley, writing in 1802, knew Lamarck's work directly, since his French colleague had just begun to publish evolutionary views. But use and disuse, as an item of folk wisdom, frequently entered the arguments of evolutionists.) Paley begins em­pirically by pointing out that centuries of disuse do not cause organs to disap­pear, though modesty leads him to cloak a classic case entirely in untranslated Latin: “The mammae of the male have not vanished by inusitation; nee curtorum, per multa saecula, Judaeorum propagini deest praeputium” [nor has the foreskin of Jews become any shorter in offspring through many centu­ries of circumcision] (p. 446).

Paley then asks, more theoretically, how any natural evolution of useful structures could be attributed to a stimulus structurally unrelated to biologi­cal form, and often inorganic. The eye is a contrivance for perceiving light, but light cannot make an eye. “Yet the element of light and the organ of vi­sion, however related in their office and use, have no connection whatever in their original. The action of rays of light upon the surfaces of animals has no tendency to breed eyes in their heads. The sun might shine forever upon living bodies without the smallest approach towards producing the sense of sight” (p. 317).

When two structures have been similarly fashioned for a common purpose by a strengthening of one and a weakening of the other (the subject of Paley's “compensations” in chapter 16), natural adjustment by evolution might be defended (as when an elephant elongates its trunk to compensate a shortness of neck). But Paley denies this “best case” by the standard argument that in­termediary stages could not be well designed: “If it be suggested, that this proboscis may have been produced in a long course of generations, by the constant endeavor of the elephant to thrust out his nose, (which is the general hypothesis by which it has lately been attempted to account for the forms of animated nature), I would ask, how was the animal to subsist in the mean­time, during the process, until this elongation of snout were completed? What was to become of the individual, whilst the species was perfecting?” (p. 299).

If the first alternative (adaptation, but by evolution) can be thus refuted, how can the second possibility (creation, but with adaptation secondary or absent) be dismissed as well? Paley now meets the formalist alternative face-to-face — and rejects this last challenge with three arguments that, taken to­gether, develop his strongest case for adaptationism (the first two remain in prominent use today):

1. Formalists do not deny the evident utility of most organic structures. The focus of their argument, rather, rests upon a claim for temporal and causal primacy (homology based upon historical order for evolutionists, or similarity based upon repeated themes in manufacture for creationists). Adaptationists hold that structures must evolve or be fashioned for utility: functional needs come first, and form follows. Formalists argue, on the other hand, that morphology may arise for reasons other than use, with later “up­take” of function as subsidiary: that is, form comes first, and organisms may then discover usages. In a remarkable passage, showing his grasp of this fun­damental alternative (now being reasserted as the basis for revival of interest in constraint among modern evolutionists), Paley admits that the formalist argument must be acknowledged as “intelligible”: “To the marks of contriv­ance discoverable in animal bodies, and to the argument deduced from them, in proof of design, and of a designing Creator, this turn is sometimes at­tempted to be given, viz. that the parts were not intended for the use, but that the use arose out of the parts. This distinction is intelligible. A cabinet-maker rubs his mahogany with fish-skin; yet it would be too much to assert that the skin of the dogfish was made rough and granulated on purpose for the polish­ing of wood, and the use of cabinet makers” (p. 72).

Paley's refutation invokes the classic response: the formalist argument will work for simple structures like fish-skin, but not for complex organs, com­posed of multiple parts, all apparently adjusted for current function. “Is it possible to believe that the eye was formed without any regard to vision; that it was the animal itself which found out, that, though formed with no such in­tention, it would serve to see with; and that the use of the eye, as an organ of sight, resulted from this discovery, and the animal's application of it?” (p. 73).

2. The first argument epitomizes a conceptual mainstay of formalism, but the empirical foundation of structuralist morphology has always depended more strongly upon correlation among parts of an organism, buttressed by the inference that structural relations, rather than utility, establish the link­age. Again Paley provides the classic functionalist refutation, still promi­nently in use. The correlations, he argues, do not arise by formal necessity, or “laws of growth,” but as coordinated adaptations, each separately useful and required for good design. Swans have long necks and webbed feet for reasons of common function, not “necessary connection”: “The long neck, without the web foot, would have been an incumbrance to the bird; yet there is no necessary connection between a long neck and a webfoot. In fact they do not usually go together. How happens it, therefore, that they meet, only when a particular design demands the aid of both?” (p. 293).

Paley then discusses a favorite example of British adaptationists since John Ray, and a pest in British gardens from time immemorial: the mole. “From soils of all kinds the little pioneer comes forth bright and clean. Inhabiting dirt, it is, of all animals, the neatest” (p. 294). Paley defends adaptation with an explicit rejection of the strongest argument for constraint (what Darwin would later call “correlation of growth”). Recalling his opening metaphor, Paley writes: “Observe then, in this structure, that which we call relation. There is no natural connection between a small sunk eye and a shovel pal­mated foot. Palmated feet might have been joined with goggle eyes; or small eyes might have been joined with feet of any other form. What was it there­fore which brought them together in the mole? That which brought together the barrel, the chain, and the fusee, in a watch: design; and design, in both cases, inferred, from the relation which the parts bear to one another in the prosecution of a common purpose” (p. 296).

3. But what can an adaptationist say about the overarching homologies of broad taxonomic structure? Are these widespread properties not formal con­straints, logically prior to any subsequent utility forged by specific tinkering with such common elements? (We certainly acknowledge such priority today, but we also recognize Darwin's incisive argument that these “phyletic” con­straints may have arisen as ancestral adaptations — see last section. Paley en­joyed no conceptual access to this legitimate adaptationist exit from the di­lemma.)

In a clever twist of argument, Paley turns homology to the cause of adapta­tion in two steps:

(1) God devised general plans with foreknowledge of their requisite modification for specific purposes in individual species. For if these grand homologies had been generated automatically by abstract laws of nature, with no reference to final causality, how could such widespread structures be so subtly subject to such varied adaptation in the service of so many particu­lar modes of life? “Whenever we find a general plan pursued, yet with such variations in it, as are, in each case, required by the particular exigency of the subject to which it is applied, we possess, in such a plan and such adaptation, the strongest evidence, that can be afforded, of intelligence and design ... If the general plan proceeded from any fixed necessity in the nature of things, how could it accommodate itself to the various wants and uses which it had to serve, under different circumstances, and on different occasions?” (Paley, 1803, p. 227).

(2) Yet Paley recognized the potential circularity in this claim, if taken by itself. To be sure, once such homologies have been established, they may be examined for susceptibility to adaptive modification. But why did God proceed in this manner at all? Why didn't he just make each species from scratch, opti­mally suited for its own peculiar mode of life? Why bother with common plans at all, when creatures sharing the plans work so differently? Here, at the crux of his difficulty, Paley invokes a venerable solution that has always (both then and now) struck critics as at least slightly sophistic (in the sense that any potential refutation could be so “accommodated,” thus making the theory irrefutable, untestable, and therefore useless): God shows his greatness by limiting his own power with ordered principles (secondary causes based on natural laws) and structural designs (grand homologies):

God, therefore, has been pleased to prescribe limits to his own power, and to work his ends within those limits. The general laws of matter have perhaps the nature of these limits . . . These are general laws; and when a particular purpose is to be effected, it is not by making a new law, nor by the suspension of the old ones, nor by making them wind and bend and yield to the occasion (for nature with great steadiness adheres to, and supports them), but it is, ... by the interposition of an apparatus corresponding with these laws, and suited to the exigency which results from them, that the purpose is at length attained. As we have said, there­fore, God prescribes limits to his power, that he may let in the exercise, and thereby exhibit demonstrations of his wisdom (p. 43).



After all, adaptationism only requires that organic designs be complex and work well, not that they embody perfection: “Contrivance, by its very defini­tion and nature, is the refuge of imperfection. To have recourse to expedients implies difficulty, impediment, restraint, defect of power” (pp. 41-42).

Paley's closing paean, following this last statement, exalts adaptation as logically necessary, quite apart from any factual validation. Contrivance not only sets the dominant pattern of empirical nature. Such good design also represents the only way that God could proclaim his existence in principle! To quote the passage of page 119 once again:

It is only by the display of contrivance, that the existence, the agency, the wisdom of the Deity, could be testified to his rational creatures. This is the scale by which we ascend to all the knowledge of our Creator, which we possess, so far as it depends upon the phenomena, or the works of na­ture. Take away this, and you take away from us every subject of obser­vation, and ground of reasoning . . . Whatever is done, God could have done, without the intervention of instruments or means: but it is in the construction of instruments, in the choice and adaptation of means, that a Creative Intelligence is seen. It is this, which constitutes the order and beauty of the universe (p. 42).



Paley's argument coheres, yet sounds a peculiarly limited range of notes — the reason for my “sand painting” metaphor of page 262. Paley does mention the grand homologies that underlie all taxonomy — but only in a paragraph or two, and only to offer an adaptationist riposte. He does formulate the structuralist argument based on correlation — but only in passing reference, and only for refutation. We might be tempted to offer the Philistine's retort — “oh well, Paley was just a philosopher; what did he know about real biol­ogy?” But modern disciplinary boundaries did not exist in 1800, and great bi­ologists, including Darwin, valued Paley above all other books in natural his­tory. Moreover, as I shall show in the next section, a fine working biologist like Agassiz could present the other side with equally uncompromising exclu­sivity.

We must therefore grasp Paley's restricted compass as a consciously-chosen vision of life's substance and meaning. As such, we may utilize, for our own instruction, a position so unsullied by nature's real complexities. We know that life cannot work at such a conceptual extreme, but any consistent and well-argued defense of such an edge remains fascinating — at least in illustrat­ing a set of mental habits that still motivates scientists. Just as we learn to grasp nature through controlled and simplified cases (the experimental method), so may we also comprehend mind by its defense of coherence at the philosophical endpoint of a continuum.





LOUIS AGASSIZ AND CONTINENTAL FORMALISM: PRAISING GOD IN THE GRANDEUR OF TAXONOMIC ORDER





Louis Agassiz, as the first permanent immigrant among great European bio­logical theorists, became the symbol and actuality of maturation and prestige for American natural history in the mid 19th century. Romantic mythology proclaims that he ventured forth as an intrepid pioneer in a quest for pristine knowledge and uncharted species. In fact, Agassiz's primary reasons for reset­tlement were far more mundane — escape from trouble and hope for a new be­ginning. He had suffered the two classic reversals of personal misfortune after years of intellectual triumph: bankruptcy (when his lithographic press, ini­tially established to print the plates for his Poissons fossiles, failed) and famil­ial strife (when his wife moved out after he had turned their home into a fac­tory and boarding house for workers at his press). In any case, whatever the complex motives, Agassiz's decision to settle permanently at Harvard estab­lished a happy incongruity within an expanding and accepting culture — a great francophone theorist, with traditional continental attitudes, living in Yankee Boston.

Agassiz (1807-1873) came to America with grand plans to invest his boundless energy in systematic work on undescribed native faunas, following his own maxim: “study nature, not books.” But, as a consummate academic politician and promoter, he became sidetracked over the years (an old story, as deep as human nature itself), and published little technical work during his last two decades. The frustration in this familiar tale of good intentions lies best exposed in Agassiz's grandest project and its failure.

Early in the 1850's, he announced plans for a lavish 10-volume work to be called The Natural History of the United States. He gathered more than 2,000 paid subscriptions in advance, and began collection (for an initial monograph on turtles) with his old and characteristic zeal. But he soon bogged down — permanently. Only four volumes ever appeared (with the de­scriptive and taxonomic work largely done by others), and he talked less and less about his grand design as the years ticked away. Nonetheless, while still imbued with initial enthusiasm, he wrote, as a book-length introduction to volume 1, his finest theoretical work, the Essay on Classification. Published in 1857, and revised in 1859 (ironically just 3 months before publication of Darwin's Origin, the book that would undermine the central premise of Agassiz's work), the Essay on Classification stands as a unique and incongru­ous document — a statement of natural theology in the highest tradition of continental formalism, published in the most English of American cities. Agassiz never mentions Paley by name, but his volume presents an almost perfect counterpoise to Paley's Natural Theology from the other pole of the great dichotomy in approaches to form — particularly, in this case, to the question of how an omnipotent God would manifest his glory in nature.

Modern supporters of systematics, in a world increasingly dominated by trendier forms of biological research, often feel beleaguered, and therefore impelled to provide a wider rationale for pursuing classification, an enterprise unfairly burdened with such epithets as “stamp collecting” by a miscompre­hending public. Today, the rationale for systematics tends to be given — quite legitimately of course — in terms of our current crises in environmental deteri­oration and declining biodiversity. Yet if any systematist ever yearned for a maximally grand rationale for his chosen profession, he could not find, or even imagine, a more audacious document than Agassiz's Essay on Clas­sification. (Unfortunately, changing philosophies and increasing knowledge have rendered Agassiz's argument obsolete, but we may still sense, and should still admire, the style and grandeur of his claim.)

In baldest terms, and from a Platonic perspective (with organisms con­strued as temporary, material incarnations, representing the permanent and transcendent mental structures of an overarching creative force), Agassiz ar­gues that taxonomy should be regarded, in principle, as the highest of the sci­ences. For species embody ideas in God's mind; and actual organisms then became transient configurations that represent, or incarnate, these ideas. Re­lationships among species, as expressed in classification, therefore reveal the structure of God's thought, for if each species denotes a divine idea, then their interconnections in taxonomy display the order of God's mentality.

Agassiz poses the key question: “Are these divisions artificial or natural? Are they the devices of the human mind to classify and arrange our knowl­edge in such a manner as to bring it more readily within our grasp and facili­tate further investigations, or have they been instituted by the Divine Intelli­gence as the categories of his mode of thinking?” (1857, pp. 7-8). He then provides his firm answer: “To me it appears indisputable, that this order and arrangement of our studies are based upon the natural primitive relations of animal life, — those systems [of classification] . . . being in truth but transla­tions, into human language, of the thoughts of the Creator.”

With this vision, Agassiz cuts through an old argument about the differen­tial “reality” of categories in a Linnaean hierarchy: Are species real and higher levels artificial? Are all categories real or do they only express the prac­tical needs of human convenience? If, as Agassiz argues, the entire taxonomic system, when properly “discovered,” records the structure of God's thoughts, then all categories must be objective segments of this divine totality. Only or­ganisms have material existence, but taxonomic categories embody higher re­ality as direct expressions of the divine mind:

Is not this in itself evidence enough that genera, families, orders, classes, and types have the same foundation in nature as species, and that individuals living at the same time have alone a material existence, they be­ing the bearers, not only of all these different categories of structure upon which the natural system of animals is founded, but also of all the relations which animals sustain to the surrounding world, — thus show­ing that species do not exist in nature in a different way from the higher groups, as is so generally believed? (1857, p. 7).



Agassiz shares Paley's primary goal, the fundamental “research program” of “natural theology” — to infer, from the organic works of nature, not only God's existence, but as much as possible about his intellect and goodness. Yet, despite this common aim, Paley and Agassiz could not have advocated more disparate constructions of divine presence in nature.

Every good debater, following the principle of dichotomy, knows that arguments fare best by contrast with alternatives. Moreover, the more caricatured and cardboard the alternative, the better for your side (so long as you don't depict your opponent as so much of a straw man that he becomes unbeliev­able). Agassiz presents his vision of classification by contrast with a “materi­alist” alternative of his own construction. He defines a materialist as a natu­ralist who attributes the forms and properties of organisms to the shaping power of constant physical laws (secondary, efficient causes), and not to di­rect decisions of divine will. A materialist may escape the charge of godless-ness by arguing for divine establishment of natural laws at the beginning of time. But if God then absconds forevermore, and lets nature work in such an automatic and heartless mode, what practical difference could we discern be­tween outright materialism and such a divine clock winder? “I allude here,” Agassiz writes (p. 9) in defining his opponents, “only to the doctrines of ma­terialists.” The issue reduces to a simple dichotomy (given the inconceiv­ability of other alternatives, including randomness): are taxa fashioned by laws of nature (and therefore in harmony with physical order), or by God as incarnations of His categories of thought? Agassiz states the contrast, and an­nounces his own allegiance: “Others believe that there exist laws in nature which were established by the Deity in the beginning, to the action of which the origin of organized beings may be ascribed; while according to others, they owe their existence to the immediate intervention of an Intelligent Cre­ator. It is the object of the following paragraphs to show that there are neither agents nor laws in nature known to physicists under the influence and by the action of which these beings could have originated” (1857, p. 13).

In a grand verbal flourish, Agassiz then upholds taxonomy as the highest science, while branding the materialist alternative both dreary and soul de­stroying (as well as wrong). Taxonomic order records divine mentality:

I confess that this question as to the nature and foundation of our scien­tific classifications appears to me to have the deepest importance, an im­portance far greater indeed than is usually attached to it. If it can be proved that man has not invented, but only traced the systematic ar­rangement in nature, that these relations and proportions which exist throughout the animal and vegetable world have an intellectual, and ideal connection in the mind of the Creator, that this plan of creation, which so commends itself to our highest wisdom, has not grown out of the necessary action of physical laws, but was the free conception of the Almighty Intellect, matured in his thought, before it was manifested in tangible external forms, — if, in short, we can prove premeditation prior to the act of creation, we have done, once and forever, with the desolate theory which refers us to the laws of matter as accounting for all the wonders of the universe, and leaves us with no guard but the monoto­nous, unvarying action of physical forces, binding all things to their inev­itable destiny (1857, p. 9).



By setting up his argument in this manner, Agassiz immerses himself di­rectly into the formalist-functionalist debate — with his own version of natu­ral theology as a strictly, almost excessively, formalist proposal: taxonomic order at all levels, not the behavior and function of individual creatures, re­cords God's nature and intent. But by characterizing (or caricaturing) his op­position as a claim for the direct production of form by physical forces, he places the chief category of putative evidence against his vision — correlation between morphology and physical conditions of life — into the functionalist camp. (One might object in principle that such a functionalist conclusion need not follow from Agassiz's version of “materialism.” After all, morphol­ogy might be fashioned by laws of nature, but without functional excellence. Still, Agassiz's chosen definition should not be dismissed as self-serving be­cause theorists who have espoused direct production of form by physical laws — D'Arcy Thompson (1917, 1942) in particular (see pp. 1179–1208) — have indeed used mechanical optimality as the criterion for their claim).

Thus, Agassiz commits himself to a “two-fisted” argument within the formalist-functionalist dichotomy: to demonstrate that taxonomic structure is a product of divine thought, he must show that classification records an an­atomical order independent of external conditions of life (the positive argu­ment for formalism), and also that a fit of form to immediate function cannot represent the generating principle of organic order (the negative argument against functionalism).

Agassiz, of course, does not deny that organisms tend to be well adapted; no formalist has ever made so strong a claim against the Paleyan alternative. He argues, rather — as formalists have done throughout history, no less so to­day than in Agassiz's time — that adaptation only expresses a secondary tin­kering and minor adjustment of prior and fundamental Bauplan built by formalist principles. In its strongest version, Agassiz's brand of formalism la­bels adaptation as a delusion because good fit only confuses our search for a deeper order by imposing a superficial overlay of specific and immediate ad­aptation upon a Bauplan, thereby obscuring the more important underlying structure.

Agassiz's chief positive argument rests upon his unswerving allegiance to Cuvier's establishment of four anatomical ground plans as the foci of animal design: Radiata, Mollusca, Articulata, and Vertebrata.* Agassiz was particu­larly impressed that von Baer, the century's greatest embryologist, had, inde­pendently of Cuvier, recognized the same system by developmental standards. If morphology and embryology coincided so well, and if the greatest students of both subjects had reached agreement by such different criteria, then the fundamental principle of natural order must lie revealed:

If we remember how completely independent the investigations of K. E. von Baer were from those of Cuvier, how different the point of view was from which they treated their subject, the one considering chiefly the mode of development of animals, while the other looked mainly to their structure; if we further consider how closely the general results at which they have arrived agree throughout, it is impossible not to be deeply im­pressed with confidence in the opinion they both advocate, that the animal kingdom exhibits four primary divisions, the representatives of which are organized upon four different plans of structure, and grow up according to four different modes of development (1857, p. 231).



But how shall taxonomists characterize the basis for this primary division into four? As God's mind lies so far beyond our poor faculties, we cannot identify his intent (though we can certainly record his decisions); but we may surely specify the criteria that he did not use. Much of Agassiz's Essay fea­tures a litany of claims in this negative mode: as only two alternatives exist, any argument against production of form by physical laws (a mode of origin that would induce a functional correlation of morphology and environment on the broadest scale) must provide support for the organization of relation­ships as categories of divine will and thought. After an introductory chapter, for example, the first two sections of Agassiz's Essay present a contrast with a common intent. How can physical laws simply produce the “best” solution for each particular circumstance if (1) identical environments house creatures of all four great body plans, and if (2) each of the body plans manages to in­habit all major environments? Agassiz summarizes: “The simultaneous existence of the most diversified types under identical circumstances exhibits thought, the ability to adapt a great variety of structures to the most uniform conditions. The repetition of similar types, under the most diversified circum­stances, shows an immaterial connection between them; it exhibits thought, proving directly how completely the Creative Mind is independent of the in­fluence of a material world” (p. 132).

Agassiz claimed even stronger support from the geological record. Environmental change exhibits no directional pattern through time, but life's history features progressive change (via successive creations, not by evolution) within each of the four immutable types. How could unaltered physical laws and nondirectional physical change fashion a progressive history of life?

Who could, in the presence of such facts, assume any causal connection between two series of phenomena, the one of which is ever obeying the same laws, while the other presents at every successive period new relations, an ever changing gradation of new combinations, leading to a final climax with the appearance of Man? Who does not see, on the contrary, that this identity of the products of physical agents in all ages, totally dis­proves any influence on their part in the production of these ever-changing beings, which constitute the organic world, and which exhibit, as a whole, such striking evidence of connected thoughts! (p. 101).



I do not claim that the refutation of Paleyan natural theology motivated this line of argument. As his major aim, Agassiz tried to debunk his carica­tured version of “materialism” by showing that organisms cannot be directly constructed by physical laws. Agassiz advances his argument primarily by in­voking numerous variations on the same theme: organisms do not “match” the physical world in the way that ice forms as the predictable and appropri­ate state for water at certain temperatures and pressures; thus, we see “how completely the Creative Mind is independent of the influence of a material world” (p. 132 as quoted above).

Agassiz begins his explicit attack on functionalism by acknowledging Paley's style of natural theology as the more common argument for God's ex­istence and benevolence (Agassiz cites the Bridgewater Treatises, the primary Paleyan documents of his generation), but then holding that adaptation can­not represent God's primary mark upon natural history for two reasons: (1) Good correlation of function to environment would not illustrate God's care in any case, for such a relation may only record the production of form by physical causes. (2) Adaptationism fails as a generality because too many constraints, imposed by unity of type, limit any organic approach to optimality:

The argument for the existence of an Intelligent Creator is generally drawn from the adaptation of means to ends, upon which the Bridge-water Treatises, for example, have been based. But . . . beyond certain limits, it is not even true. We find organs without functions, as, for in­stance, the teeth of the whale, which never cut through the gum, the breast in all males of the class of Mammalia; these and similar organs are preserved in obedience to a certain uniformity of fundamental structure, true to the original formula of that division of animal life, even when not essential to its mode of existence. The organ remains, not for the performance of a function, but with reference to a plan (pp. 9-10).



Adaptation exists, of course, but only as a superficial and secondary over­lay upon unity of type — the deeper and true reflection of God's majestic or­der: “When naturalists have investigated the influence of physical causes upon living beings, they constantly overlooked the fact that the features which are thus modified are only of secondary importance in the life of ani­mals and plants, and that neither the plan of their structure, nor the various complications of that structure, are ever affected by such influences” (p. 17).

Most importantly, this deeper unity of type not only represents a natural principle in dichotomous opposition to adaptation, but also proves that cre­ative thought, not mere mapping upon physical conditions, establishes or­ganic order.

In all these animals and plants, there is one side of their organization which has an immediate reference to the elements in which they live, and another which has no such connection, and yet it is precisely this part of the structure of animals and plants, which has no direct bearing upon the conditions in which they are placed in nature, which constitutes their essential, their typical character. This proves beyond the possibility of an objection, that the elements in which animals and plants live . . . cannot in any way be considered as the cause of their existence (p. 33).



Having cleared away the notion that something so trivial as adaptation might represent God's signature in nature, Agassiz can now complete his ulti­mate defense of taxonomy as the custodian of God's presence in nature, as manifested in the broad relationships sanctioned by unity of type. Consider how much we may know of God's nature — a veritable volley of adjectives — once we locate his correct signature at the appropriate pole of nature's great dichotomy:

The products of what are commonly called physical agents are every­where the same, (that is, upon the whole surface of the globe) and have always been the same (that is, during all geological periods); while orga­nized beings are everywhere different and have differed in all ages. Be­tween two such theories of phenomena there can be no causal or genetic connection. The combination of space and time of all these thought­ful conceptions exhibits not only thought, it shows also premeditation, power, wisdom, greatness, prescience, omniscience, providence. In one word, all these facts in their natural connection proclaim aloud the One God, whom man may know, adore, and love; and Natural History must, in good time, become the analysis of the thoughts of the Creator of the Universe, as manifested in the animal and vegetable kingdoms (p. 135).



Moreover, in understanding taxonomy as an incarnation of divine thought, we also sense our own importance in the cosmos. For if our taxonomy can mirror God's order so well, then our minds must also resemble His in princi­ple, however infinitely poorer in capacity:

Do we not find in this adaptability of the human intellect to the fact of creation, by which we become instinctively, and, as I have said, unconsciously, the translators of the thoughts of God, the most conclusive proof of our affinity with the Divine Mind? And is not this intellectual and spiritual connection with the Almighty worthy of our deep consider­ation? If there is any truth in the belief that man is made in the image of God, it is surely not amiss for the philosopher to endeavor, by the study of his own mental operation, to approximate the workings of the Divine Reason, learning, from the nature of his own mind, better to understand the Infinite Intellect from which it is derived. Such a suggestion may, at first sight, appear irreverent. But, which is the truly humble? He who, penetrating into the secrets of creation, arranges them under a formula which he proudly calls his scientific system? Or he who, in the same pur­suit, recognizes his glorious affinity with the Creator, and, in deepest gratitude for so sublime a birth right, strives to be the faithful interpreter of that Divine Intellect with whom he is permitted, nay, with whom he is intended, according to the laws of his being, to enter into communion? (p. 8).



With so much at stake, from the basis of natural order to confidence in our mental affinity with God himself, the primacy of broad taxonomic formal­ism over local adaptationism (however exquisite) becomes an issue of highest moment and passion. Darwin's added dimension of history would derail Agassiz's grand design just three months after the Essay received its definitive printing, but we should remember Agassiz's effort, and grasp his argument, as perhaps the noblest brief ever presented for the centrality of systematics among the sciences.





AN EPILOG ON THE DICHOTOMY





While acknowledging some historical interest in the contrast, modern evolu­tionists might question, on two grounds of supposed irrelevance to current is­sues, the time I have taken to contrast Paley with Agassiz: (1) Paley and Agassiz struggled to find the proper signature of God in nature, and such an effort no longer counts as part of science; (2) Darwin added a third, historical dimension, thereby fracturing the old dichotomy of form and function, and rendering its terms obsolete.

I would argue, in response, that Darwin's addition, though surely the most important and revolutionary event in the history of biology scarcely rendered the old dichotomy irrelevant (see pp. 251–260 for a fuller development of this point). As Figure 4-3 shows, any morphology attributed to Darwin's histori­cal dimension must still, by recursion, be judged by the dichotomy at its time of origin — that is, we must still know whether an ancestral form arose by adaptation or constraint (or by what mixture of the two poles). Thus, we may say that Darwin's new dimension expanded the scope of the dichotomy by compelling its application to two domains — past and present — when we ana­lyze the basis of any trait in a living organism.

Evolution does not establish an ultimate divide for all transitions in the his­tory of biology. Several themes pass right through this great revision, only al­tering their terms and explanations. Formalism vs. functionalism may be the most prominent and persistent of issues too grand even for evolution to undo (or fully resolve). Paley and Agassiz once fought this battle in grand style; Dawkins and Goodwin cannot cast so broad a conceptual net, or muster the same stylistic panache today, but they pursue the same conflict. Paley vs. Agassiz remains relevant to modern evolutionists by the primary criterion of genealogical continuity.

If Paley and Agassiz represent the yin and yang of totality for the analysis of form, then Darwin, though a pluralist who understood both poles, did ulti­mately cast his lot with the Paleyan yin, in filial piety with a British tradition that has spanned centuries, and still continues today. This imbalance, and the struggle for redress that now commands so much discussion in contemporary evolutionary biology, defines one of the three major issues that led me to write this book. The formalist alternative, as embodied in the subject now generally called “constraint,” provides a counterweight to stabilize the sec­ond leg in Darwin's essential tripod of support — the primacy of adaptation in asserting the creativity of natural selection at overwhelming relative fre­quency among the causes of evolutionary change.

The past holds sufficient interest and capacity for illumination all by itself, and no justification in terms of present enlightenment need ever be given. Still, as a practicing scientist, I do favor the use of history as a current guide — while I struggle not to wrench the meaning and motivation of arguments from the primary matrix of their own time. I don't know how else to proceed when tides of history overwhelm a worthy subject for little reason beyond the vagaries of fashion and contingency. Scientists too often become convinced that inexorable logic or irrefutable data have closed a subject forever. Even worse, given our propensity for historical ignorance, we often collectively forget that an alternative ever existed at all. In such cases, I know no better tactic for reopening an important subject than the record of history — the proof that brilliant scientists (so worthy of our admiration that we cannot be­little their concerns) devoted their concentrated attention to an issue that never achieved true settlement, but only veered towards transient “resolu­tion” by sociological complexities of shifting preferences, rather than logic of proof or exigencies of data. I believe that structuralist and formalist ap­proaches to anatomy fell out of favor for such invalid reasons of fashion, and that the full range of this primary dichotomy must now be reestablished. And I unabashedly call upon the great formalists of history to state their case; while I ask modern evolutionists to make the proper translation to mod­ern terms.

To reassert the importance of both poles in this dichotomy, I again cite my primary candidate for the unenviable title of most worthy “invisible man” — an important and influential thinker and educator in his day, but now entirely forgotten. I tried to resurrect the Reverend James McCosh, president of Princeton University, in Chapter 2 (pp. 116-118), and I now again want to call upon his fine book, published in 1869 in collaboration with George Dickie: Typical Forms and Special Ends in Creation. The Greek inscription on the title page — typos kai telos (type and purpose) — epitomizes the argu­ment. The two poles of the dichotomy inhere in all natural objects, and full explanation demands attention to both:

In taking an enlarged view of the constitution of the material universe, so far as it falls under our notice, it may be discovered that attention, at once extensive and minute, is paid to two great principles or methods of procedure. The one is the Principle of Order, or a general plan, pattern, or type, to which every given object is made to conform with more or less precision. The other is the Principle of Special Adaptation, or partic­ular end, by which each object, while constructed after a general model, is, at the same time, accommodated to the situation which it has to oc­cupy, and a purpose which it is intended to serve. These two principles . . . meet in the structure of every plant and every animal (McCosh and Dickie, 1869, p. 1).



McCosh also recognized the contingent and socially embedded nature of national preferences. He notes that English tradition — from Robert Boyle and John Ray through Paley to the Bridgewater Treatises — has favored the adaptationist theme. Thus, he argues, recent discoveries in formalist mor­phology have been viewed as threatening by some biologists (McCosh cites the French and German schools of ideal or transcendental morphology, espe­cially in their English translation through the work of Richard Owen, whom I treat later in this chapter): “The arguments and illustrations adduced by Brit­ish writers for the last age or two in behalf of divine existence, have been taken almost exclusively from the indications in nature of special adaptation of parts. Hence, when traces were discovered in the last age of a general pat­tern, which had no reference to the comfort of the animal or the functions of the particular plant, the discovery was represented by some as overturning the whole doctrine of final cause; not a few viewed the new doctrine with sus­picion or alarm” (McCosh and Dickie, 1869, pp. 6-7).

But McCosh regards this perceived threat as false, and urges that formalist insights be welcomed — for full explanation demands attention to both poles. McCosh expresses the two key ideas in religious terms as natural illustrations of “lofty wisdom” (formalism) and “providential care” (functionalism). We call the same themes constraint and adaptation, but the image of exquisite balance remains every bit as valid today:

We do not know whether to admire most the all-pervading order which runs through the whole of nature, through all the parts of the plant and animal, and through the hundreds of thousands of different species of plants and animals, or the skillful accommodation of every part, and of every organ, in every species, to the purpose which it is meant to serve. The one leads us to discover the lofty wisdom which planned all things from the beginning, and the enlarged beneficence reaching over all with­out respect of persons; whereas the other impresses us more with the providential care and special beneficence which, in attending to the whole, has not overlooked any part, but has made provision for every in­dividual member of the myriads of animated beings (p. 439).



Though mercilessly savaged for intellectual mediocrity by W. S. Gilbert and other satirists and activists, the British peerage did turn out an occasional scholar or two. The Duke of Argyll might have won his title fair and square if Gilbert's ultimate recommendation had ever been instituted. (The Fairy Queen in Iolanthe, royally pissed off at a group of nobles, threatens: “peers shall teem in Christendom, and a Duke's exalted station be attainable by competitive examination!”) In a presidential address to the British Associa­tion, the good Duke, as a prominent critic of evolution and author of several books still worth reading today, argued that relations between both necessary poles of the dichotomy still persisted as a key issue in Darwin's new biology: “What is the meaning of that great law of adherence to type and pattern, standing behind, as it were, and in reserve, of that other law by which organic structures are specially adapted to special modes of life? What is the relation between these two laws; and can any light be cast upon it derived from the history of extinct forms; or from the conditions to which we find that existing forms are subjected?” (quoted in McCosh and Dickie, 1869, p. 68).

Since then, countless events, from meanderings of history to permanencies of empirical discovery, have rocked this subject back and forth. But equi­librium at a center of dynamic tension, not of complacent rest, may foster our best biological understanding, and the Duke's question could not be more current, more a propos.





Unity of Plan as the Strongest Version of Formalism:

The Pre-Darwinian Debate





MEHR LICHT ON GOETHE'S LEAF





A prevalent myth of our time proclaims that broad and interdisciplinary vi­sions, though held in disrepute today, were once valued in a more ecumenical age that celebrated the “Renaissance man.” But the motto that “a cobbler should stick to his last”* dates from the 4th century bc, and people who wander outside their primary field have always attracted suspicion or ridicule. In 1831, near the end of a long life, a poet who had ventured into science de­plored his failure to obtain a fair hearing, but defended his forays as inter­nally necessary for a broad and searching intellect:

The public was taken aback, for inasmuch as it wishes to be served well and uniformly, it demands that every man remain in his own field. This demand is well grounded, for a man who wishes to achieve excellence, which is infinite in its scope, ought not to venture on the very paths that God and nature do. For this reason it is expected that a person who has distinguished himself in one field, whose manner and style are generally recognized and esteemed, will not leave his field, much less venture into one entirely unrelated. Should an individual attempt this, no gratitude is shown him; indeed, even when he does his task well, he is given no spe­cial praise. But a man of lively intellect feels that he exists not for the public's sake, but for his own. He does not care to tire himself out and wear himself down by doing the same thing over and over again. More­over, every energetic man of talent has something universal in him, caus­ing him to cast about here and there and to select his field of activity ac­cording to his own desire (1831 essay, in Mueller and Engard, 1952, p. 16.9).



We might ignore this statement, if its author stood among the many hope­fuls whom history fails to memorialize in either their chosen or their adopted professions. But the writer cited above, J. W. von Goethe, wrote a thing or two of enduring merit! Moreover, and in retrospect, his ventures into science far transcended the brief forays of an amateur dabbler.

In any case, Goethe did not suffer complete neglect from scientists during his lifetime. In 1831, the great anatomist Etienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire praised Goethe's science as the work of “a poet trying to sing the grandeur of the universe in another form” (“un poete s'essayant de chanter sous une autre forme les grandeurs de l'univers” — 1831, p. 189). Geoffroy continued (1831, p. 193): “If Goethe had not already amassed enough titles to be proclaimed the greatest genius of his century, he would have added, to his crown of great poet and profound moralist, the fame of a wise naturalist — due to him for the profundity of his views, and for the philosophical force of his opinions on the subject of botanical analogies.”*

But Geoffroy's praise (see Fig. 4-8) cannot be reckoned as entirely disinterested, for Goethe had just favored his side in the greatest brouhaha of early 19th century zoology — the celebrated 1830 debate with Cuvier before the Academie des sciences. Geoffroy needed all the help he could get (and he would later recruit other literary figures, including the novelists Balzac and George Sand, to his cause as well). Cuvier, after all, was no ordinary oppo­nent, and the subject of their argument — the age-old dispute of formalism and functionalism — could not have been more central to natural history.

Geoffroy, with good cause, viewed Goethe as the doyen and spiritual leader of formalist morphology. Not only had Goethe coined the word “morphol­ogy,” but he had, long before, defended for plants the central proposition that Geoffroy championed for animals as the starting point for his anatomical views — the reduction of form to a single generating archetype (the leaf for Goethe, the vertebra for Geoffroy). While the young Geoffroy worried about establishing a career and surviving a revolution, Goethe was traveling in It­aly and developing the theory of his 1790 work, Versuch die Metamorphose der Pflanzen zu erkldren (Fig. 4-9). (This work, little more than a pamphlet, consists of 123 numbered and almost aphoristic paragraphs. I shall quote by number from the standard translation of Mueller and Engard (1952). But I have read and own a copy of the original, which I highly recommend to any­one who appreciates the fusion of great writing and fascinating science.)

Goethe had been strongly interested in morphology throughout his life, and his preferences had always tended towards formalism, particularly to­wards the strongest version of the argument (and subject of this section) — the vision of a single, generating archetypal form, setting both the bounds and the possibilities of realized morphology. His two most famous forays into ani­mal anatomy both rested upon a formalist foundation: (1) his early support for the vertebral theory of the skull, a conviction that he traced to 1791 when he examined “a battered sheep skull from the sand of the dune like Jewish





4-8. A letter from Etienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, written in January 1831 to a Mr. Payaud, with Goethe featured in the penultimate paragraph. (Geoffroy pre­sumably enclosed some writings of Goethe along with this letter to Payaud.) The text of the paragraph reads as follows: “Goethe est ci-joint. Sa bonhomie qui n'exclue pas la force et la justesse d'esprit, vous frappera.” (Goethe is enclosed. His good nature, which does not preclude strength and fairness of spirit, will strike you.)

cemetery in Venice” (1823 essay, in Mueller and Engard, 1952, p. 237); and (2) his discovery of the human premaxillary bone in 1784, based on its pres­ence in other mammals and his convictions about unity of type. (Goethe called this bone the intermaxilare; others referred to it as “Goethe's bone.” In an essay written in 1832, the year of his death, Goethe recalled this discov­ery as “the first battle and the first triumph of my youth” (Goethe, 1832, p. 573).)

But Goethe chose botany for his most extensive study in formalism, and probably his finest contribution to science. In this important work, Goethe applied to plants the same vision that Geoffroy and Owen would later ad­vance in trying to reduce the great complexity and diversity of animal (or at least vertebrate) form to the single generating pattern of an archetypal verte­bra (see Geoffroy, 1831, for a homage to Goethe). For Goethe, the leaf rep­resented an archetypal form for all plant parts growing from the central stem* — from cotyledons, to stem leaves, to sepals, petals, pistils and stamens, and fruit.

The common epitome of Goethe's system — all is leaf — should not be taken literally as the actual reduction of all serial diversity to the actual form of a stem leaf. Such a reading would contravene the Platonic character of arche­types in formalist theory. The “leaf” represents an abstract generating princi­ple, from which stem leaves depart least in actual expression. Goethe writes: “We ought to have a general term with which to designate this diversely metamorphosed organ and with which to compare all manifestations of its form . ... We might equally well say that a stamen is a contracted petal, as that a petal is a stamen in a state of expansion; or that a sepal is a contracted stem leaf approaching a certain stage of refinement, as that a stem leaf is a se­pal expanded by the influx of cruder saps” (1790, No. 120).

Goethe expressed the epitome of his system in measured tone within his es­say (1790, No. 119): “The organs of the vegetating and flowering plant, though seemingly dissimilar, all originate from a single organ, namely, the leaf.” In private, he became more effusive: “[I have traced] the manifold spe­cific phenomena in the magnificent garden of the universe back to one simple general principle” (1831 essay, in Mueller and Engard, 1952, p. 168). To friends, as to the philosopher J. G. Herder, he could become positively effu­sive (dare I say florid): “The archetypal plant as I see it will be the most won­derful creation in the whole world, and nature herself will envy me for it. With this model and the key to it, one will be able to invent plants..., which, even if they do not actually exist, nevertheless might exist, and which are not merely picturesque or poetic visions and illusions, but have inner truth and logic. The same law will permit itself to be applied to everything that is liv­ing” (letter of 1787, quoted in Mueller and Engard, 1952, p. 14).

Goethe dissects and compares, trying to find the leaf-like basis of appar­ently diversified and disparate structures. The anastomosed sepals, forming the calyx at the base of a flower, must be leaves that fail to separate when a cutoff of nutriment stops expansion of the stem: “If the flowering were re­tarded by the infiltration of superfluous nutriment, the leaves would be sepa­rated and would assume their original shape. Thus, in the calyx, nature forms no new organ but merely combines and modifies organs already known to us” (1790, no. 38).

When parts become too distinct to show connection and reduction to the leaf archetype in one species, Goethe uses the comparative approach to find transitional forms in other taxa. The seedpod and sexual organs are mani­festly unleaflike in many plants, but Goethe establishes transitional series to species with, for example, leaflike seedpods, or fertile stem leaves (as in ferns). Consider his exposition of the comparative method for “difficult” seedpods: “Nature obscures the similarity to the leaf most when she makes the seed containers soft and juicy or firm or woody; however, the similarity will not escape our attention if we contrive to follow it in all its transitional stages” (1790, No. 79). Or for the even more divergent cotyledons that even­tually grow into tolerably leaflike form:

12. They are often misshapen, crammed, as it were, with crude matter, and as much expanded in thickness as in breadth; their vessels are unrec­ognizable and scarcely distinguishable from the mass as a whole. They bear almost no resemblance to a leaf, and we might be misled into re­garding them as special organs.

13. Yet in many plants the cotyledons approach leaf form: they flatten out; exposed to light and air, they assume a deeper shade of green; their vessels become distinct and begin to resemble veins.

14. Finally they appear before us as true leaves: their vessels are capa­ble of the finest development; their similarity to the subsequent leaves will not permit us to consider them separate organs; and we recognize them instead as the first leaves of the stem (1790, Nos. 12-14).



If Goethe's system really advocated, as often misportrayed, a simple and exclusive concept of the archetypal leaf, his theory could stake no claim for interesting completeness — for this central principle cannot explain system­atic variation in form up the stem, and therefore could not operate as a full explanation for both similarities and characteristic differences in the parts of plants. But, in his most fascinating intellectual move, Goethe proposes a com­plete account by grafting two additional principles onto the underlying no­tion of archetype: the progressive refinement of sap, and cycles of expansion and contraction. We may regard these principles as ad hoc or incorrect today, but the power of their conjunction with the archetypal idea can still be appre­ciated with much profit.

These two additional principles embody both necessary sides of the pri­mary Western metaphor for intelligibility in any growing, or historically ad­vancing, system — arrows of direction and cycles of repeatability (I called these conjoined principles “time's arrow” and “time's cycle” in my book on the discovery of geological time — Gould, 1987b). We must, in any temporal process, be able to identify both sources of story and order: vectors of change (lest time have no history, defined as distinctness of moments), and underly­ing constant or cyclical principles (lest the temporal sequence proceed only as one uniqueness after another, leaving nothing general to identify at all). Goethe, faced with observations of both directionality and repeatability up the stem, recognized the need for both poles of this dichotomy.

Refinement of sap as a directional principle. Up and down, heaven and hell, brain and psyche vs. bowels and excrement, tuberculosis as a noble disease of airy lungs vs. cancer as the unspeakable malady of nether parts (see Susan Sonntag's Illness as Metaphor for a brilliant analysis of these conventional images). Almost irresistibly, we apply this major metaphorical apparatus of Western culture to plants as well — with gnarly roots and tubers as lowly objects of the ground, and fragrant, noble flowers as topmost parts, straining towards heaven. Goethe, by no means immune to such thinking in an age of Naturphilosophie, viewed the growth of a plant as progressing to­wards refinement from cotyledon to flower. He explained this directionality by postulating that, moving up the stem, each successive leaf modification progressively filters an initially crude sap. Inflorescence cannot occur until these impurities have been removed. The cotyledons begin both with minimal organization and refinement, and with maximal crudity of sap: “We have found that the cotyledons, which are produced in the enclosed seed coat and are filled to the brim, as it were, with a very crude sap, are scarcely organized and developed at all, or at best roughly so” (1790, No. 24).

The plant then grows towards a floral apotheosis, but too much nutriment delays the process of filtering sap — as material rushes in and more stem leaves must be produced for drainage. A decline in nutriment finally allows filtering to attain the upper hand, and the sap becomes sufficiently pure for inflor­escence: “As long as cruder saps remain in the plant, all possible plant organs are compelled to become instruments for draining them off. If excessive nutri­ment forces its way in, the draining operation must be repeated again and again, rendering inflorescence almost impossible. If the plant is deprived of nourishment, this operation of nature is facilitated” (1790, No. 30). Finally, the plant achieves its topmost goal: “While the cruder fluids are in this man­ner continually drained off and replaced by pure ones, the plant, step by step, achieves the status prescribed by nature, We see the leaves finally reach their fullest expansion and elaboration, and soon thereafter we become aware of a new aspect, apprising us that the epoch we have been studying has drawn to a close and that a second is approaching — the epoch of the flower” (1790, No. 28).

Cycles of expansion and contraction. If the directional force worked alone, then a plant's morphology would only express this smooth continuum of progressive refinement up the stem. Since, manifestly, plants do not display such a pattern, some other force must be operating.* Goethe describes this second force as cyclical, in opposition to the directional principle of refining sap. He envisages three full cycles of contraction and expansion during ontogeny. The interplay of these progressive and cyclical forces pro­duces the full pattern of a general refinement up the stem, but impacted by discontinuities and transitions that express no directional pattern (“contrac­tion” of stem-leaves to sepals by bunching together in a circlet, for example). The cotyledons begin in a retracted state. The main leaves, and their substan­tial spacing on the stem, represent the first expansion. The bunching of leaves to form the sepals at the base of the flower marks the second contraction, and the subsequent elaboration of petals the second expansion. The reduction of archetypal leaf size to form pistils and stamens marks the third contraction, and the formation of fruit the last and most exuberant expansion. The con­tracted seed within the fruit then starts the cycle again in the next generation. Put these three formative principles together — the archetypal leaf, progressive refinement of sap up the stem, and three expansion-contraction cycles of veg­etation, blossoming, and bearing fruit — and the vast botanical diversity of our planet falls under the chief vision of formalism: production of realized va­riety from interaction of a few abstract, general, and internally based (not ex­ternally imposed and adaptationally driven) morphological laws: “Whether the plant vegetates, blossoms, or bears fruit, it nevertheless is always the same organs with varying functions and with frequent changes in form, that fulfill the dictates of nature. The same organ which expanded on the stem as a leaf and assumed a highly diverse form, will contract in the calyx, expand again in the petal, contract in the reproductive organs, and expand for the last time as fruit” (1790, No. 115).

This formalist commitment implies an aversion to primary explanation by adaptation, function or final cause. In accord with all the great formalists, Goethe often expressed his dislike of explanations based upon the externality of fit between form and function (though he delighted in the evident fact of such fit, as formalists also generally do, for such an admission poses no threat to the chief formalist argument for primacy of morphological order — see Chapter 11 on exaptation).

Goethe's statements on final cause often attack the larger idea of manufac­ture for explicitly human ends — not the chief complaint of formalist mor­phology, but worth recording, if only for the power of Goethe's prose:

For several centuries down to the present, we have been retarded in our philosophic views of natural phenomena by the idea that living organ­isms are created and shaped to certain ends by a teleological life force. ... Why should he not call a plant a weed, when from his point of view it really ought not to exist: He will much more readily attribute the exis­tence of thistles hampering his work in the field to the curse of an en­raged benevolent spirit, or to the malice of a sinister one, than simply re­gard them as children of the universal nature, cherished as much by her as the wheat he carefully cultivates and values so highly (from essay of 1790, in Mueller and Engard, 1952).



But Goethe also attacked adaptationist primacy in the more focused realm of explaining morphology: “It is not a question of whether the concept of final causes is convenient, or even indispensable, to some people, or whether it may not have good and useful results when applied to the moral realm; rather, it is a question of whether it is an aid or a deterrent to physiologists in their study of organized bodies. I make bold to assert that it does deter them, therefore avoided it myself and considered it my duty to warn others against it” (2nd essay on plant metamorphosis, written in 1790, in Mueller and Engard, 1952, p. 80).

Citing a perennial complaint, then and now, against adaptationist explanations — that such efforts tell good stories in the speculationist mode, but do not explain morphology — Goethe compares final causes with Linnaeus' fan­ciful descriptions of sexual anatomy in plants: “For example, Linne calls flower petals 'curtains of the nuptial bed,' a parable that would do honor to a poet. But after all! the discovery of the true physiological nature of such parts is completely blocked in this way, just as it is by the convenient and false es­pousal of the theory of final causes” (2nd essay on plant metamorphosis, written in 1790, in Mueller and Engard, 1952, pp. 79-80).

Proper morphological explanations, Goethe asserts, must be sought on internal and formalist principles; external fit, though of great importance, can only be regarded as secondary: “In my opinion, the chief concept underlying all observation of life — one from which we must not deviate — is that a crea­ture is self-sufficient, that its parts are inevitably interrelated, and that noth­ing mechanical, as it were, is built up or produced from without, although it is true that the parts affect their environment and are in turn affected by it” (2nd essay on plant metamorphosis, written in 1790, in Mueller and Engard, 1952, p. 80).

In a remarkable passage, that could serve as a credo for modern formalism as well, Goethe asserts his central claim for internalist primacy, while also specifying the vital, but secondary, role of adaptation. Internal formation acts as a primary source that “must find external conditions.” Adaptation may then shape a range of diversity from an underlying form, but the arche­typal pattern cannot be explained by these secondary modifications, and the adaptations themselves can only express a superficial restructuring of inher­ent order:





Man, in considering all things with reference to himself, is obliged to assume that external forms are determined from within, and this assump­tion is all the easier for him in that no single living thing is conceivable without complete organization. Internally, this complete organization is clearly defined; thus it must find external conditions that are just as clear and definite, for its external existence is possible only under certain con­ditions and in certain situations.... An animal possesses external useful­ness precisely because it has been shaped from without as well as from within, and — more important and quite natural — because the external element can more readily adapt the external form to its own purposes than it can reshape the internal form. We can best see this in a species of seal whose exterior has taken on a great deal of the fish character while its skeleton still represents the perfect quadruped (2nd essay on plant metamorphosis, written 1790, in Mueller and Engard, 1952, p. 83).





Goethe's views therefore provide a “test case” for a primary thesis of this book. We should, I believe, recognize the space of our intellectual world as inherently structured, by some combination of our evolved mental quirks and the dictates of logic, into a discontinuous array of possible, coherent posi­tions — hence the double entendre in the title of this book. These mental posi­tions express “morphologies,” just as organisms do. The chief components of these “morphologies” must reside together and interact to build the “es­sence” of any powerful intellectual system. The components of a theory's es­sence should be recognized as both deep and minimal; with other less impor­tant and potentially dispensable principles allied to them in secondary webs subject to “restructuring” by “adaptation.” (Thus I advocate a minimal set of three principles for defining the essence of Darwinism, while regarding other components of the usual Darwinian nexus as conjoined more loosely and less central intellectually.) These essential and minimal components remain corre­lated, although arising independently and in reiterated fashion, across lan­guages, centuries and cultural traditions. Such firm linkages define the struc­ture of these few nucleating positions in the intellectual landscape.

In formalist or structuralist theories, the strongest correlation unites a commitment to generative laws of form with an aversion to adaptationist explanation as the primary goal of morphology. The two commitments need not conjoin in logic or empirical necessity; indeed, Darwin found a brilliant argu­ment to drive them asunder by identifying most (though not all) generating principles as past adaptations, and relegating remaining laws of form to a pe­ripheral or secondary status (see section 1 of this chapter). But almost every formalist theory of morphology also views adaptation as secondary tinkering rather than primary structuring.

I regard Goethe as an exemplar of this approach to major scientific theories because he was, in an important sense, an outsider to the swirling debates of formalism vs. functionalism in his time. He understood, of course, his affinity with the formalism of German Naturphilosophie. But he did not attend the debates, publish in the journals, or use the lingo of developing scientific pro­fessionalism. He viewed himself as apart and neglected. In fact, he didn't even regard the debate between Cuvier and Geoffroy, which fascinated him so keenly at the end of his life (see pages 310–312), primarily as a struggle be­tween formalism and functionalism, but rather as a contest between the em­piricism of Cuvier and the intuitionism of transcendental morphology — and his explicit preference for Geoffroy invoked his poet's concern with the pri­macy of abstract ideas as much as his morphologist's attention to the primacy of form.

In this context of Goethe's separation from the core of scientific contro­versy in 1830, we should not treat his own formalism as derivative, imitative, or simply imbibed from the stated mores of a recognized intellectual brother­hood. If his views also feature — as they do — a linkage of interest in laws of form with an antipathy to adaptationist explanation, then we may interpret the correlation as independently generated, at least in part, and therefore as good evidence for a link based upon intrinsic intellectual entailment in the “morphology” of formalism as a key “nucleating” idea in biology.

Indeed, Goethe showed a strong appreciation for the morphology (and, in this case, the utility) of dichotomy in intellectual life. In discussing his under­standing of the division between Cuvier and Geoffroy, Goethe noted that each man defended not a single idea or a unitary position, but rather a nexus or complex of mutually entailed notions, causing a precipitation at one of two foci — with these two aggregations then opposing each other like the poles of a magnet. For Goethe, the systems of Cuvier and Geoffroy formed “two different doctrines, which are so ordinarily and so necessarily separated that little chance exists for finding them together in a single person. On the contrary, it is of their essence that they not be well allied” (Goethe, 1831, p. 181). For Darwin, discontinuity originates by historical contingency (fol­lowing extinction of intermediate forms) in a fully accessible and isotropic morphospace. Natura non facit saltum. But the universe of formalism — in ideas and in morphology — views discontinuity as inherent in the structure of inhabitable space.





GEOFFROY AND CUVIER





Cuvier and Conditions of Existence


The struggle of Cuvier and Geoffroy continues to rivet our attention (from Russell, 1916, to the modern book of Appel, 1987) because this conflict fea­tures the two central elements of intellectual drama: a clash of two superior minds within the primal tale of professional ontogeny: two scholars begin as warm friends fired with the idealism of youth, and end as wily, cynical, politi­cally astute opponents. (The conventional view interprets Cuvier as a clear winner by virtue of such astuteness and Geoffroy as loser by naiveté and woolliness. I shall defend a different version of interesting, disparately styled, equality.)

When the French revolutionary government established the Museum d'histoire naturelle as the world's finest in 1793, Etienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, installed as the first curator for vertebrates, played a primary role in bringing Georges Cuvier to Paris, thus launching his scientific career. The two men enjoyed close friendship, sharing living quarters and making idealistic plans for the reform and flowering of natural history. In 1798, as Geoffroy embarked with Napoleon upon a long expedition to Egypt, he wrote to Cuvier: “Goodbye my friend, love me always. Do not cease to consider me as a brother” (in Appel, 1987, p. 73).

But their differences in temperament, intellect and style eventually and inevitably drove them apart. Cuvier became one of the most powerful, politi­cally conservative figures ever to operate in Western science. The oft quoted statement of the awestruck Charles Lyell, visiting Cuvier at the height of his influence, provides insight into the nature of his power:

I got into Cuvier's sanctum sanctorum yesterday, and it is truly characteristic of the man. In every part it displays that extraordinary power of methodizing which is the grand secret of the prodigious feats which he performs annually without appearing to give himself the least trouble ... There is first the museum of natural history opposite his house, and admirably arranged by himself, then the anatomy museum connected with his dwelling. In the latter is a library disposed in a suite of rooms, each containing works on one subject. There is one where there are all the works on ornithology, in another room all on ichthyology, in another osteology, in another law books! etc.... The ordinary studio contains no bookshelves. It is a longish room comfortably furnished, lighted from above, with eleven desks to stand to, and two low tables, like a public of­fice for so many clerks. But all is for the one man, who multiplies himself as author, and admitting no one into this room, moves as he finds neces­sary, or as fancy inclines him, from one occupation to another. Each desk is furnished with a complete establishment of inkstand, pens, etc. . . . There is a separate bell to several desks. The low tables are to sit to when he is tired. The collaborators are not numerous, but always chosen well. They save him every mechanical labour, find references, etc., are rarely admitted to the study, receive orders and speak not (in Adams, 1938, p. 267).



Appel notes an interesting source of Cuvier's accumulated influence: “Cuvier was able to remain on the Council [of State] through the Empire, three kings, and several ministries because he held no extreme opinions and was willing to support whatever regime was in power” (1987, p. 53). Yet, lest we view this chameleonic shifting merely as cynical and self-serving, much like the Vicar of Bray in the old song about maintaining office through all the vicissitudes of 17th century British politics, Appel points out the underlying consistency of a true political and biological conservative: after a bloody and traumatic revolution, any hierarchical order, proceeding from any source holding promise for stability, must be preferred over potential anarchy and populism.

Appel designates three broad domains of difference between Cuvier and Geoffroy: Cuvier's conservative connection to substantial political power, his insistence (largely for rhetorical purposes, since science cannot operate in such a manner) that the profession restrict itself to reporting positive facts and shunning speculation, and his commitment to one of the purest forms of functionalism ever maintained in the study of morphology. Appel notes the evident connection between political elitism and the call for a descriptive, factually based science of experts:

In a politically volatile country which had recently experienced trau­matic revolution, Cuvier justly feared that speculative theories, most of which had a materialist tinge, would be exploited in the name of science and undermine religion and promote social unrest. If science could be limited to experts and restricted to accumulating “positive facts” then it might achieve a measure of autonomy, while at the same time the questioning that might lead to heretical theories would be eliminated. As Cuvier became increasingly concerned about the danger posed by certain biological theories, he became increasingly insistent on the restraints imposed by proper scientific method (Appel, 1987, pp. 52-53).



The third theme of morphological explanation, though supported by other roots, also melds into the Cuvierian totality of politics, method, and theory — for Cuvier's functionalism views organisms as discrete, untransformable en­tities, designed for specific conditions of life and no other. By contrast, Geoffroy held opposite attitudes on all three accounts — as an outsider in poli­tics, both academic and national; a dreamer and visionary in methodology, a man who explicitly exalted the power of ideas to guide and even to channel factual inquiry; and a resolute formalist in morphology, with a theory of ro­bust generation and transformation along lines set by overarching laws of structure and archetypal form.

To grasp the purity of Cuvierian functionalism, we must break through a century's commitment to genealogical models of relationship. We are now so wedded (properly of course) to the homological basis of deep similarity by descent, that we can scarcely imagine any other theory of Bauplan. After all, what could the sequence of humerus, to radius and ulna, to carpals, meta-carpals and phalanges denote except inheritance by common descent when expressed over so broad a functional range as dolphin, dog and bat. Even the most rabid panselectionist would not identify phylum-level homologies (broad symplesiomorphies) as indications of current function. At most, fol­lowing Darwin (see pp. 253–260), they would view such features as originat­ing by adaptation in distant ancestors. Current function will then be ex­pressed in particular modifications of homologies within each line.

Yet Cuvier actually believed that common features of current Bauplan recorded such immediate functional rules of correlation. Cuvier acknowledged that science does not yet understand organic physics well enough to know the logical basis of these rules, and must therefore work empirically from com­parative anatomy, but the regularities must be rooted in function and will, one day, be resolved analytically. Start with a carnivore's claw (or canine tooth, or any other tool of its trade), and all other items of anatomy follow by mechanical necessity. One part implies the next, and eventually the entire skeleton, according to correlations set by functional rules alone. Type records broad function; specific adaptation denotes local function. No part exists “in vain” or merely to indicate conformity to plan (vestigial organs, developmen­tal sequelae). Evolution becomes literally inconceivable because change in one part requires corresponding change in every other intimate detail — and no one can imagine a mechanism for such globally coordinated alteration. (Nor can one, even today, gainsay this excellent argument. If evolution were not mosaic, transmutation would be inconceivable, and would not occur pre­cisely for the reasons stated by Cuvier.)

In Cuvier's remarkable output of publications, three works stand out as powerful, comprehensive documents that established professions and set a good part of the course of 19th century biology — the 5 volume Legons d'anatomie comparee of 1800-1805, the 4 volume Recherches sur les ossemens fossiles of 1812, and Le regne animal of 1817. The pivotal role of these three works has always been acknowledged, but their common philo­sophical grounding in Cuvier's overarching functionalism has not been ade­quately recorded.

The Legons of 1800-1805 arranges natural history in functional terms by shunning the usual taxonomic order and proceeding instead by organ systems considered in operational rather than morphological terms. Volume one treats locomotion, functionally focused and defined (“les organes du mouvement”), while subsequent volumes proceed through sensation, diges­tion, circulation, respiration, voice, generation, and excretion.

The very first lesson, functionally organized as “considerations sur Veconomie animale,” presents the heart of Cuvier's approach. His theory of function cannot be characterized as a crude, “democratic” adaptationism, part by part with each item separately optimized, but rather as a more subtle, hierarchical system that renders both structural regularities and correlations in functional terms. Primary functions, common to all organisms, lie at the base — origin by generation, growth by nutrition, and termination by death (see Russell, 1916, p. 31). Secondary functions — feeling and moving — build a layer above and set the morphology of organs for their manner of operation. These secondary, or “animal,” functions, with their neuromuscular expres­sion, determine a yet higher level of “vital functions” — digestive, circulatory, and respiratory, in that order. Feeling and movement require a set of organs to hold and process food; digestion then implies a system of distribution (cir­culation). Higher levels may then feed back “in a type of circle” (Cuvier, 1805, p. 47) to influence the logically prior foundation. Power of movement affects mode of generation and “fluide nerveux” of secondary status flows through channels of tertiary circulation. Above all, function holds pri­ority and determines structure; coordination and correlation among struc­tures records the hierarchical ordering of interrelated functions (see particu­larly Cuvier, 1805, pp. 45-60).

Cuvier states the functional foundation of his morphology in bold terms (1805, p. 47): “The laws that determine the relationships of organs are founded upon this mutual dependence of functions, and upon the aid that they lend to each other. These laws have a necessity equal to laws of meta­physics and mathematics. For it is evident that a proper harmony among or­gans that act upon each other is a necessary condition of existence* for the creature to which they belong. If one of these functions were modified in a manner incompatible with modifications of other organs, this creature could not exist.”

This statement of analytically necessary functional laws, and ineluctable correlation of parts, echoes the philosophy better known from the justly cele­brated Discours preliminaire of Cuvier's 1812 Recherches, the document that founded modern paleontology by establishing the fact of extinction and or­ganic succession through time. The laws of organic form have a purely func­tional basis. One anatomical part implies all others, for proper function (not abstract laws of structure) demands such interdependence.* Animals there­fore cannot undergo substantial change by evolution because such a complex and precisely coordinated transformation of all parts could not occur — espe­cially under functionalist theories of the independent and adaptational ori­gin of each part (rather than the coordinated change of all parts of an arche­typal form along preestablished lines of possibility, thus making evolution far easier to conceive under the formalist philosophies that Cuvier rejected). Therefore, when geological conditions change drastically, many species die and can never reappear or continue in any way. The sequence of extinctions through time gives the earth a history by establishing a vector of directional change. Geology, now furnished with an alphabet, can finally become a sci­ence. Cuvier expresses the functional basis of correlation:

Every organized individual forms an entire system of its own, all the parts of which mutually corresponds, and concurs to produce a certain definite purpose, by reciprocal reaction, or by combining towards the same end. Hence none of these separate parts can change their forms without a corresponding change in the other parts of the same animal, and consequently each of these parts, taken separately, indicates all the other parts to which it has belonged (from the standard Jameson transla­tion, 1818, p. 99).

In short, the shape and structure of the teeth regulate the forms of the condyle, of the shoulder-blade, and of the claws, in the same manner as the equation of a curve regulates all its other properties (1818, p. 102) . . . Anyone who observes merely the print of a cloven hoof, may con­clude that it has been left by a ruminant animal, and regard the conclu­sion as equally certain with any other in physics or in morals (p. 105).



The relationship of the third great work — Le regne animal of 1817 — to this functionalist nexus seems more obscure at first. Here Cuvier codifies the sys­tem of animal taxonomy that he first published in 1812 — the abandonment of the old bipartite division of vertebrate and invertebrate (and the equation of vertebrate classes with invertebrate phyla), for a system of four equal embranchements based on necessarily separate and untransformable anatom­ical plans: Radiata, Articulata, Mollusca, and Vertebrata. This appeal to lim­ited and untransformable anatomical designs as a basis for taxonomic order smacks of structuralism, but Cuvier, true to his guiding philosophy, presents a purely functional interpretation. Appel (1987, p. 45) explains: “The unity within an embranchement came not from a comprehensive unity of plan, but from a common arrangement of the nervous system, functionally the most important system of the animal. The forms of the other major systems remain constant throughout an embranchement because the other systems — respira­tion, circulation, etc. — were functionally subordinate to the nervous system and determined by the requirement of the nervous system. Animals within an embranchement could vary almost arbitrarily in their accessory parts, precisely because accessory parts were not necessitated by the choice of the nervous system.” Both unity and diversity therefore achieve a functional interpretation — unity by operational design, diversity by local adaptation. Conditions of existence set both major aspects of taxonomy.

I emphasize a primary intellectual correlation throughout this chapter — formalism with commitment to internal constraint (in the positive sense of channeling change, not only the negative definition of restriction). To render this connection meaningful, the converse must also hold: functionalism must correlate with denial of constraint. Cuvier's arguments test and affirm this im­plication.

In an overly broad (and therefore operationally meaningless) construction of constraint, all biologists acknowledge some restriction on organic form, if only because all conceivable shapes and sizes have not been realized. But we usually do not apply this term to nature's avoidance of obviously unworkable creatures (flying elephants or large dinosaurs with pencil-thin legs in Galileo's world of laws regulating the ratio of surface to volume), for no one disputes the underlying physical basis for their nonexistence. (For historically con­tingent reasons of modern professional life within a Darwinian functional­ist paradigm, we currently apply the term “constraint” primarily to inter­nal channels and limitations not set by adaptation — see my full argument for this usage in Chapter 10, pp. 1027–1037. That is, we apply the concept of “constraint” to sources of influence outside a favored explanation — see Gould, 1989a.)

Thus, Cuvier cheerfully acknowledged limits set by function, but did not view such boundaries as constraining because aborted, unworkable creatures offend the very notion of a rational creating force. Instead, and thereby af­firming the link of functionalism to a denial of constraint, Cuvier clearly cher­ished his general theory as a principle for maximizing God's liberty to create (translated as “adaptation to alter” in the modern evolutionary version of functionalism). Cuvier wrote in an 1825 essay on “Nature”: “If we look back to the Author of all things, what other law could actuate Him but the neces­sity of providing to each being whose existence is to be continued the means of assuring that existence? And why could He not vary His materials and His instruments? Certain laws of coexistence of organs were therefore necessary, but that was all. For to establish others there must have been a want of free­dom in the action of the organizing principle, which we have shown to be only a chimera” (in Appel, 1987, p. 138).

Cuvier, a severe rationalist (see Fig. 4-10 for an interesting and previously unpublished illustration of Cuvier's rationalism and hostility to florid metaphor),





4-10. A remarkable note, written by Cuvier in his own hand, and indicating how much this rationalist thinker rejected and ridiculed silly metaphorical uses of poetic imagery as a substitute for rigor, or for saying anything of real sub­stance. Here Cuvier jotted down two such fatuous and metaphorical uses of “sphere” — obviously stored away for later use in satire or ridicule. (Author's collection.)

Definition of life by M. Virey. Life is a circular movement, sustained and measured by time; time, that infinite sphere, of which God alone is the center, and where living beings are placed on the circumference, describing in their rapid or­bit, the circle of their destiny.

Definition of poetry by Mme. de Stael. Poetry is the winged mediator, which moves distant nations and ancient times in a sublime sphere where admiration takes the place of sympathy.





rarely waxed poetic about nature's abundances, but he surely rejoiced that organic form knew no limits beyond good design.

While always remaining within the boundaries prescribed by necessary conditions of existence, nature abandons herself to all fecundity not limited by these conditions; and without ever departing from the small number of possible combinations for modification of important organs, she seems in all accessory parts, to be limitlessly endowed . . . Thus we find that as we move away from the principal organs, and approach those that are less important, varieties are multiplied; and when we arrive at the surface, where the nature of things ordains that the least important parts be placed, and where any damage is least dangerous, the number of varieties becomes so great that all the work of natural­ists has not succeeded in giving us any idea of its magnitude (1805, p. 58).





Geoffroy's formalist vision


Since the modes and practices of science inevitably reflect a surrounding so­cial environment, we should scarcely be surprised that the early to mid 19th century world of revolution in politics, and romanticism in art, literature, and music, also inspired a series of biological movements called Naturphilosophie in Germany and romantic, idealistic, transcendental, or philosophical anat­omy elsewhere. A scientific movement may begin under strong social influ­ence and little compulsion by data, but its empirical adequacy may ultimately rank high nonetheless. (Evolutionists, above all other professionals, should be optimally preprogrammed to appreciate the difference between reasons for origin, and assessment of eventual value — see pp. 1214–1218 particularly for Nietzsche's analysis of this vital issue in historiography.) Geoffroy, as the most important of the transcendental morphologists, heard the songs of his time, but he also composed a flawed symphony that plays better today than to the previous generation that built the Modern Synthetic theory of evolu­tion, and that improves even more when we recover and refurbish the origi­nal instruments of its initial performance.

The story has been told many times and in many contexts (think of Don Quixote), but romantic dreamers often temporize and lose ground while practical schemers reap the benefits of accumulated diligence. Cuvier, three years younger than Geoffroy, began his Museum career in a clearly subor­dinate professional status. But while Geoffroy followed his bliss in Egypt, Cuvier built his career in Paris. Cuvier soon overtook his former protector, and Geoffroy brooded. (Cuvier, for example, entered the Academie des sci­ences, the forthcoming stage for the great 1830 debate, in 1795, while Geoffroy did not win membership until 1807.) By 1805, Cuvier had already published his Legons d'anatomie comparee in five volumes, while Geoffroy had produced no major counterweight. Geoffroy, strong in ambition what­ever his shortcomings in political acumen, knew that he needed a distinctive approach or discovery to secure his renown, and he found a guiding light in formalism, the “philosophic anatomique” of the book (1818) that would se­cure his reputation.

Geoffroy began by applying the chief formalist notion of unity of type to the vertebrate skeleton. Reptiles, birds, and mammals presented minimal dif­ficulty, but fishes posed the key challenge to such a comprehensive view. Compared with terrestrial vertebrates, fishes seemed so different in their anat­omy of skull, fins, and shoulder girdle, and so disparate in mode of respi­ration, that any notion of a common plan must be deemed untenable if not fatuous prima facie. Cuvier had argued on functional grounds that the uniqueness of several skeletal elements in fishes testified to their fitness for swimming and breathing in water.

Geoffroy published a group of memoirs on the anatomy of fishes in 1807, the first successes of his research program. Working primarily with bones of the shoulder girdle, he found a putative homologue of the furcula (wishbone) in birds. The functionalist credo that such a bone must exist “for” flight must therefore be false. Rather, the furcula in birds, and its homolog in fishes (op­erating as an additional rib in some species, and as an aid to opening the gills in others), must be specialized representatives of an abstract element in the ar­chetype of all vertebrates. The form of the archetype holds priority, whereas diversified functional utility only represents a set of secondary modifications, superimposed by conditions of existence upon the primacy of underlying form. Thus, in his first foray into formalism, Geoffroy codified the key idea of structural constraint: form exerts both logical and temporal priority upon function; good designs exist in abundance because the archetype includes this potential for secondary modification; function does not create form, rather form finds function: “Without a direct object in swimming animals, without a utility determined in advance, and thrown, so to say, by chance into the field of organization, the furcula enters into connection with the organs near it; and according to the manner in which this association is formed, it takes on uses which are in some sense prescribed by them” (Geoffroy, 1807, quoted in Appel, 1987, p. 87).

The boldest version of the formalist argument for vertebrates, strongly up­held and extended by Geoffroy, hypothesizes a comprehensive unity of type across the entire phylum — with all elements present in all species (if only in embryos, or fused in adults), and with no new elements originating for spe­cific functions. This strict account embodies both meanings of constraint in their strongest versions — the negative sense of limitation in restriction of ele­ments to pieces of the archetypal jigsaw puzzle; and the positive sense of di­rected channels providing numerous, though ordered, possibilities for modi­fied shapes (including forms as yet unrealized on our planet, but predictable from the channels, and implied by observed developmental pathways).

Geoffroy wrote in 1807 (quoted in Appel, 1987, p. 89): “It is known that nature works constantly with the same materials. She is ingenious to vary only the forms... One sees her tend always to cause the same elements to re­appear, in the same number, in the same circumstances, and with the same connections.”

Talk is cheap, and romantic notions of abstract, overarching unity can eas­ily be verbalized. Lorenz Oken, the leader of German Naturphilosophie, wrote wondrous aphorisms (1809-1811, English translation, 1847), and pro­duced solid empirical work early in his career (1806), but never established a methodological program or built a factual foundation for his formalist phi­losophy. Meckel, Carus, and other Naturphilosophen extended the empirical side, but we rightly honor Geoffroy as the legitimate focus of this move­ment by our primary scientific criterion of fruitful utility. Geoffroy won his fame as a formalist because he managed to “cash out” the common ideas of transcendentalism in a workable program of research. His program included the two elements demanded of any good theory in natural history: a method for identifying the central phenomenon, and a reasonable explanation for ex­ceptions.

The paradox and pitfall of unity of type as a working research program lies in the vast range of modifications that the archetype experiences under the widely varied adaptive regimes of our planet. Elements of the archetype should, in principle, be named and identified by their form, but the idealized archetype may be modified into incompatibility and unrecognizability along the copious adaptive pathways of concrete earthly biology — and we therefore face the dilemma that archetypal elements cannot always be identified by their shapes, or even by their discreteness (for elements fuse, or appear in em­bryos and then drop out during ontogeny). Some other criterion must be de­veloped.

Geoffroy's major productive insight (still a favored basis for recognizing anatomical homologies — see Riedl, 1978) lay in his “principle of connec­tions” — the claim that homology must be identified by the relative positions and spatial interrelationships of elements, rather than primarily by form. Parts may expand and contract according to utility, but topology remains un­altered, and the archetype can be traced by unvarying spatial order.

Yet, as so often happens amidst the exuberant diversity of natural history, the criterion must be nuanced as “traced by unvarying spatial order ... ex­cept when you can't.” Just as Haeckel bolstered recapitulation by bounding and taxonomizing exceptions (heterochronies and heterotopies in his termi­nology — see Gould, 1977b), and as Darwin specified forces other than, but clearly subsidiary to, natural selection (1859, p. 6), Geoffroy recognized a key class of exceptions to the principle of connections in his concept of metas­tasis (we use the word in a different, medical sense today, but the general meaning of movement to anomalous places has not altered). Connections can break and blocks of elements can move (though topology within blocks does not alter). For example, the shoulder girdle attaches to the rear of the head in fishes. But, in tetrapods, this connection breaks and several vertebrae may be interposed between skull and forelimbs (see p. 320 for the central role of this metastasis in Owen's interpretation of the vertebral archetype).

In addition, Geoffroy tried to codify rules for secondary adaptive modifica­tion of archetypal form. Why do elements vary so much in size, and why can they fuse or even disappear? Geoffroy relied primarily upon a loi de balancement, or principle of compensation. Only so much general material can be commandeered to construct the archetypal elements. If one part be­comes hypertrophied by utility, others must atrophy to secure the constancy of the common fund. Geoffroy wrote succinctly in 1829 (quoted in Russell, 1916, p. 72): “There is only a single animal modified by the inverse reciprocal variation of all or some of its parts.”

Most systems of thought achieve their exemplification in a canonical document; how would natural selection be defined without the Origin? Geoffroy's formalism received its codification in an 1818 book with a majestic title — Philosophie anatomique (or Anatomical Philosophy, explicitly not the less grandiose Anatomie philosophique, or Philosophical Anatomy). Geoffroy's subtitle brought the subject down to earth and bone with the best test case that vertebrates can offer — Pieces osseuses des organes respiratoires (the bony elements of the respiratory organs). Geoffroy began this work with an interesting example that highlights the contrast of formalism and functionalism, and that sowed the seeds for his later public debate with Cuvier.

Cuvier had named and described four bones in the opercular series of teleost fishes — operculum, preoperculum, suboperculum, and interoperculum. And he, given his functionalist perspective, had treated these bones as unique to fishes and necessarily present for their utility in respiration by gills. Geoffroy developed a contrary interpretation based on his commitment to unity of the vertebral type, and to a primary implication that these bones must be homologues of elements with different functions in other verte­brates — for all vertebrates possess the same archetypal pieces, and none can be gained or lost. Geoffroy worked on the opercular bones from 1809 to 1812, without resolution. In 1812, a good year for wars and overtures, Cuvier argued that he had located, in the skulls of fishes, the homologs for all bones in the mammalian head — leaving no mammalian structures to serve as potential homologues of opercular bones in fishes. Henri de Blainville, Geoffroy's chief formalist supporter, then argued for homology between the opercular elements of fishes and bones of the tetrapod lower jaw. But, in 1817, Cuvier showed Geoffroy a preparation of a pike and convinced him that all bones of the lower jaw could be matched with jaw elements of tetrapods, again leaving no tetrapod bones to interpret as transformations of the opercular series. Geoffroy then returned to this crucial problem and realized, in a flash as he later stated, that he would have to investigate the only remain­ing elements in the tetrapod head for a solution: the opercular bones must be homologs of the mammalian middle ear bones! Geoffroy reminisced in 1830 (quoted in Appel, 1987, p. 97): “I regained courage and recommenced my studies, never to abandon them again.”

Respiratory bones set the crucial experiment for vertebrate unity of type because such deciding tests must provoke maximal dangers of disconfirmation and grapple with the most difficult issues of validation. The respiratory bones from fish to tetrapods pose prima facie challenges to unity of type — for they present no apparent homology from sea to land, and they also exhibit maximal difference of function within vertebrates. If these bones could be won for formalism, then the rest of the skeleton would fall into order.

The Philosophie anatomique includes five monographs on homologies between fishes and tetrapods for bones of (and around) the respiratory ele­ments: first on putative homology of opercular and hearing bones (incorrect in retrospect of course), second on the sternum, third on the hyoid, fourth on the branchial arches and their derivates (including the true homologs of the hearing bones, as biologists later learned), and fifth on the shoulder gir­dle. Cuvier, not yet perceiving (or at least not publicly admitting) his col­league's work as a comprehensive threat to his functionalist system, pro­claimed Geoffroy's publication as bold, challenging, and worthy of respect — though almost surely wrong. He strongly doubted Geoffroy's focal homology of opercular and hearing bones, for how could such large, central, and func­tionally necessary bones of fishes represent the same elements as tiny, almost superfluous nubbins ensconced within organs of differing utility in tetrapods?

Geoffroy, who certainly equalled Cuvier in lack of modesty, proclaimed in the introduction to the Philosophie anatomique that his work marked “a new epoch, to which the publication of this book fixes the date” (1818, p. xxxi). He also admitted, tweaking Cuvier's allegiance to the primacy of positive facts, that formalist commitments come first. With such a proper conceptual key, the bones of the skeleton fall into place: “I do not hide it; my direction has been given to me by an a priori principle” (1818, p. 11) — although, he hastens to add, unity of type has worked so well that the principle could now be inferred inductively from the skeleton itself!

Geoffroy proceeds immediately to battle in defending formalism by explicit contrast with false assumptions in Cuvier's functionalist alternative. He tells us on page 3 that fishes, by virtue of their functional differences from other vertebrates, seem to possess an anatomy of irreducible uniqueness. “It might appear to the observer ... that fishes, in order to exist, must call upon the in­tervention of new organs, and could only be complete in their construction by means of elements destined for them alone, bones created uniquely for their profit” (1818).

But Geoffroy counterposes formalist unity of type to the functionalist alternative of special organs for novel uses: “I can and will satisfy you by showing you that all the elements used in the composition of fishes are exactly and en­tirely the same as those that enter into the formation of man, mammals, birds, and reptiles” (1818, p. 9).

Geoffroy then takes up the two key challenges previously mentioned. He must first explicate the undeniable fact that the girdle, forelimbs and trunk organs have shifted back in tetrapods relative to their anterior position in fishes — as a result of the interposition of vertebral elements, and in apparent contradiction to the law of connections. Geoffroy invokes his exceptional principle of metastasis and argues that “the trunk exists under the milieu [sous le milieu] of the vertebral column” as a whole (1818, p. 9), but not un­der any particular element in the series. Second, he acknowledges that respi­ratory organs — with their maximally varying forms and functions in verte­brates — do pose the chief challenge for his system: “In this case, it would be entirely natural to assume in advance that the action of external conditions would impose requirements capable of placing the respiratory apparatus out­side the condition of the other organs. From the two modes so rigidly ordained [imperieusement exiges] for respiration, one might and could con­clude [on a du et pu conclure, in more euphonious French] that two different organic systems must exist... In this situation, respiration sets the most im­portant question to treat under our views” (1818, pp. 12-13).

After presenting his homological solutions, Geoffroy buttresses his form­alist philosophy by explicit defense of the key claim that internal laws and constraints establish a primary and controlling pattern, with adaptive modi­fication as secondary, consequential and limited: “This influence of the exte­rior world, if ever called upon to become a perturbing cause of organiza­tion, must be bound necessarily within very straight limits: animals must oppose to them [exterior forces] several attributes inherent to their nature ... This struggle cannot fail to end to the advantage of interior organization, which has laws [droits] against which nothing can prevail” (1818, pp. 208-209).

Finally, Geoffroy cuts to the heart of the deepest philosophical issue in the debate by noting that the realized use of archetypal elements for two such dif­ferent purposes as breathing in air and water requires that the elements them­selves be fashioned with great redundancy in potential utility: “double means have been prepared for a single function” (1818, p. 448). The archetype, by maintaining this potential for a full range of eventual expression, cannot be optimal for any particular role. Since archetypes exert logical and temporal priority over any particular expression, pure form endowed with redundancy of functional expression must hold sway over utility and adaptation: “Nature has conceived her plan for construction of a vertebrate animal under a double point of view: she had to choose a form of composition, so that the ideal ani­mal could accommodate itself equally to the two environments that envelop our globe. Above all, it was necessary ... that these two domains of the exter­nal world, which so rigorously impose two such different modes of respira­tion, must call upon the single and only basis of [morphological] organiza­tion” (1818, p. 448).

Perhaps Geoffroy had anticipated the forthcoming struggle when he made his florid appeal, in the closing words of his Discours preliminaire (1818, p. xxix), to the attention and approbation of the next generation: “Oh might I learn that [my conclusions] have been useful for the youth of our schools. What group in our beautiful France is more worthy of interest? What devo­tion, what application, what ardor for study! Oh admirable youth, so occu­pied with noble productions of the mind, you seem absorbed in a single thought, in the thought that led Virgil to say: Felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas [Happy is he who can know the causes of things].”

Throughout the 1820's, as events moved to their eventual climax in the 1830 debate, Geoffroy continued to codify and fortify his formalist philoso­phy — while Cuvier, who had once viewed Geoffroy's work with mild interest from a different perspective, moved (or felt pushed) to overt opposition.* Geoffroy emphasized, again and again, the two themes most calculated to rouse Cuvier's ire, and most central to the formalist conviction that adapta­tion for function can only record a secondary matching (following produc­tion by laws of form), not a primary construction.

1. Function follows form. Consider Geoffroy's favorite motto: “such is the organ, such will be its function.” Or two more specific statements from 1829 (quoted in Russell, 1916, p. 77): “Animals have no habits but those that re­sult from the structure of their organs ... A vegetarian regime is imposed upon the Quadrumana by their possession of a somewhat ample stomach, and intestines of moderate length.”

2. Final causes cannot serve as explanatory principles. Consider Geoffroy's second favorite motto: “Je me garde de preter a Dieu aucune intention” (I take care not to ascribe any intentions to God).

Could Cuvier, who thought he knew God's ways (or at least the extent of His freedoms), remain silent against the taunts of such a turbulent priest?





The debate of 1830: foreplay and aftermath


Geoffroy, who loved aphorisms amidst his intense wordiness, often stated: “there is, philosophically speaking, only a single animal.” When he applied this radical notion of archetype only within the Vertebrata (as he did in his seminal work of 1818), Cuvier remained at relative peace, albeit in opposi­tion. But, two years later, Geoffroy took the fatal step that first elicited overt opposition from his former friend. Upholding formalism in explicit contrast to the functionalist credo had riled Cuvier to a considerable extent, but so long as this apostasy did not invade the schema of four unbridgeable embranchements, the foundation of Cuvier's taxonomy (1817), Geoffroy could be tolerated.

In 1820, Geoffroy made a crucial move that filled him with the joy of uni­fication, and struck Cuvier as an act of unbridled imperialism: he extended the vertebral archetype to encompass arthropods as well, thus bringing two of the four embranchements under a common generating form — the vertebra itself. In his key article of 1822, Geoffroy described this “discovery” as “one of the greatest joys that I ever felt in my life” (1822, p. 99), for he had realized that “insects formed another class of vertebrated animals, and that they were, consequently, brought under the common law of uniformity of organization” (1822, p. 99).

An attempt to homologize the Bauplan of insects and vertebrates implies some wondrous correspondences, and Geoffroy did not shrink from the logi­cally necessary, but inherently curious implications. He argued that both phyla are fundamentally metameric, with the idealized vertebra itself acting as the archetype of each segment — and therefore, in repetition and regional specialization, of the entire animal. If Goethe's leaf could generate all the or­gans of a plant, then Geoffroy's vertebra would prefigure the entire skeleton of animals.

Since the arthropod skeleton overlies the internal organs, whereas verte­brate bones lie below flesh and blood, their homology implies a remarkable conclusion, endorsed in yet another motto devised by Geoffroy: insects must live within their own vertebrae! Geoffroy wrote in 1822: “Every animal lives outside or inside its vertebral column” (Tout animal habite en debars ou en dedans de sa colonne vertebrate). Continuing the string of surprising implica­tions, all explicitly endorsed by Geoffroy, if exoskeletal body rings must be treated as homologs of vertebrae in the spinal column, then arthropod ap­pendages must be equated with vertebrate ribs — and insects walk on their ribs!

Geoffroy's attempted comparisons posed two major challenges to his own “law of connections” for establishing homology: how can inside and outside become reversed if topology be inviolate; and how can arthropods, with their ventral nerve tracts, be brought into structural harmony with the dorsal nerve cord of vertebrates? Geoffroy proposed an ingenious explanation for the me­tastasis of inside and outside: He argued that hard parts (and other organs) develop as deposits or exudates on the outside of vessels. In vertebrates, the dorsal nerve cord secretes the vertebrae around itself, while other organs emerge as exudates around vessels of the circulatory system. But insects lack a heart, making their circulatory system too weak to build organs. Therefore, only the nervous system can carry material for the deposition of hard parts — and all other organs must form within the resulting outer set of rings.

The inversion of orientation did not require such an elaborate rationale, but only a repositioning of viewpoint. Geoffroy regarded “top” and “bot­tom” as subjective terms of a secondary and derivative functionalism. (Geoffroy never intended his homology of vertebrates and inverted arthro­pods as an evolutionary claim for the origin of vertebrates from an arthropod that literally turned over onto its back. For Geoffroy, the two orientations represented ecological alternatives for a common design.) The primary topol­ogy of formalism puts little store by the derivative ecology and function that leads the same side of an invariant organization to turn towards the sun in some groups, and towards the ground in others.

This solution is not, by any means, problem-free, for such changes of topology must also be rationalized. In particular, and as a major stumbling-block (especially for later, evolutionary versions in the “worm that turned” theory of vertebrate origins), the mouth lies below the brain and spinal cord in vertebrates, but above the nerve cords in arthropods, with the esophagus piercing through the cords. Turn an insect over, and the mouth should lie on top, above the brain. Geoffroy and later supporters of this homology gener­ally argued that the old arthropod mouth and nerve-piercing esophagus sim­ply closed, while the digestive tube formed an entirely new ventral “mouth” (therefore not homologous with the arthropod orifice). In any case, and with an almost wondrous and partly humorous irony as I shall show in Chapter 10, Geoffroy's fundamental homology has been validated (in modern guise) after more than a century of calumny. The genetic determinants of dorsoventral patterning may well be homologous but reversed in expression in arthro­pods and vertebrates (see pp. 1117–1123).

If Geoffroy belittled Cuvier's functionalism in his argument about orienta­tion, he also attacked the deeper postulate of adaptational primacy by argu­ing, once again, that the archetypal vertebra comes first, with any use of the resulting structures developing only later as a consequence. Why, he asks, do arthropods use their “ribs” for locomotion? And he answers with the old cliché about mountain climbing — because they are there. Geoffroy wrote in 1820 (quoted in Russell, 1916, p. 77): “From the circumstance that the verte­bra is external, it results that the ribs must be so too; and, as it is impossible that organs of such a size can remain passive and absolutely functionless, these great arms, hanging there continually at the disposition of the animal, are pressed into the service of progression, and become its efficient instru­ments.”

Cuvier may have been offended by the arthropod connection, but he was too smart a rhetorician, and too much a figure of the establishment, to be drawn into the limelight of public debate, thus giving even more publicity to Geoffroy's apostasy. Geoffroy goaded him throughout the 1820's, but with no public response. Finally, the dam burst in 1830. Meyranx and Laurencet, two young provincial naturalists with an eye on advancement, presented a monograph, “Some considerations on the organization of mollusks,” to the Academie des sciences — the standard path for career building at the time. They suggested that the anatomy of a squid might be homologized with a ver­tebrate bent back upon itself at the middle of the vertebral column, so that the buttocks and base of the spine lined up with the nape of the neck.

Their original paper has been lost, and we do not know how far they meant to carry the comparison, or how much they had intended to inject themselves into the formalist-functionalist controversy. But we do know that Geoffroy, appointed as one of two commissioners to prepare a public report for the Academie, rejoiced at this entering wedge for a second imperialistic raid upon Cuvier's embranchements. The inclusion of arthropods had once seemed rad­ical enough, but if mollusks could also be brought under the vertebral arche­type, then three of four phyla would be reduced to common design, and a final absorption of the Radiata could not lag far behind. The dream of total unification now seemed within Geoffroy's grasp.

Therefore, at the weekly, Monday afternoon meeting of February 15, 1830, Geoffroy presented an enthusiastic endorsement of Meyranx and Laurencet's work, perhaps extending their conclusions far beyond their own intents and desires. And Cuvier finally reached his breaking point.

On February 22, Cuvier appeared, colored charts in hand, to demolish the proposed homology of mollusk and vertebrate. He showed, with devastating effect, that although some organs may look similar and bear the same name, they occupy entirely different topological positions in the two phyla and therefore cannot be homologized by Geoffroy's own criterion of connection. Moreover the anatomy of cephalopods features several organs not found in vertebrates at all. Strongly attacking Geoffroy and his pretensions, Cuvier stated (in Geoffroy, 1830, p. 243):

One of our learned colleagues, Monsieur Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire avidly seized upon this new view and announced that it completely refuted all that I had said on the distance that separates mollusks and verte­brates. Going much further than the authors of the memoir [Meyranx and Laurencet], he concluded that, up to now, zoology had had no solid base, that it had been an edifice constructed upon sand, and that the only true basis, henceforth indestructible, shall be a certain principle that he calls unity of composition [unite de composition], and which, he assures us, will have a universal application.



Following this flourish of controlled contempt, Cuvier presented his spe­cific rebuttal (in Geoffroy, 1830, p. 257): “Cephalopods have several organs in common with vertebrates, and fulfilling similar functions; but the organs are differently arranged in mollusks, often constructed in a different manner, and accompanied by several other organs that vertebrates do not possess.”

Poor Meyranx and Laurencet. They became the ultimate victims of numer­ous clichés, hackneyed by virtue of their fundamental truth — bit off more than they could chew, sacrificial lambs, caught in the middle, between Scylla and Charybdis, a rock and a hard place. The two young men disappeared, forthwith and permanently, both from immediate view, and from later his­tory. Of poor Laurencet, we do not even know his first name (official reports, in those days, spoke only of M. — for Monsieur — so-and-so). Of the equally wretched Meyranx, we know only his attempt to rend his garments before the powerful Cuvier. He wrote, in an abject letter to Cuvier (quoted in Appel, 1987, p. 147): “I cannot find words to express how devastated I am that our Memoir has given rise to disputes. We could scarcely believe that anyone could draw such exaggerated consequences from a single, simple consider­ation on the organization of mollusks.” He then added that the memoir con­tained nothing “which contradicts the admirable work that you have written and that we regard as the best guide in this matter.”

Cuvier, having demolished a specific argument about mollusks, and grasp­ing the deeper issue with his usual clarity, set the groundwork for expanding the debate by defending his functionalist view against the true subject of Geoffroy's primary concern — the defense and hegemony of formalist morphology. Cuvier stated (in Geoffroy, 1830, pp. 248-249), belittling the idea of unity of type: “It [unity of type] is only a principle subordinate to another that is much more important and much more fecund — that of the conditions of existence, of the fitting of parts and their coordination for the role that the animal must play in nature. This is the true philosophical principle, from which flows the possibility of certain resemblances, and the impossibility of others; this is the rational principle from which one may deduce that of anal­ogies [homologies in modern usage] of plan and composition.”

With Meyranx, Laurencet and mollusks forgotten (to Cuvier's satisfaction and Geoffroy's relief), the debate moved on to greater generalities of formal­ism vs. functionalism. Geoffroy replied briefly on February 22, and then, on March 1, presented a general defense of his theorie des analogues (homo­logies), illustrated primarily with his old favorite example of hyoid bones in fishes and tetrapods. On March 8, Geoffroy had fallen ill and Cuvier refused to deliver his rebuttal in his colleague's absence. The large crowd, lured by the promised fireworks more than the putative content, dispersed in disap­pointment. Cuvier replied in kind by failing to attend the following week; tit for tat. The debate finally resumed on March 22, with Cuvier's rebuttal of Geoffroy's claims for hyoid homologies. Geoffroy defended himself on March 29, but he had clearly tired of the affair, for he stated, with more than a whiff of disingenuous disengagement, that “a meeting of the disciples of the Portico” had regretfully turned into theater — “a pit applauding the outra­geous comedies of Aristophanes” (quoted in Appel, 1987, pp. 154-155). Cuvier replied one last time on April 5, but Geoffroy ended the public debate by announcing that he would not respond. Cuvier surely enjoyed advantages as a brilliant debater and consummate politician, but we must not consider Geoffroy either devoid of wiliness, or willing to surrender. He merely shifted ground to the more comfortable medium of print. By April 15, in a fit of zeal and celerity as impressive as anything achieved with our current technology of instant books, Geoffroy had sent to the printers the text of his Principes de philosophic zoologique, containing all papers and commentary presented by Cuvier and himself during the public debate. (Several years ago, I had the good fortune to purchase Cuvier's own copy of this work. The book bears Cuvier's library stamp (Fig. 4-11), but I find no sign, in marginalia or any other indication of use, that the great man ever consulted the volume!)

Intellectual debates of such grand scale and diverse content can never be won or lost in the unambiguous fashion of more worldly events, as when Joe Louis knocked out Max Schmeling. Most biological texts (Russell, 1916, for example) proclaim Cuvier the victor — surely a fair judgment for the narrow, initiating topic of molluscan homologies. But the debate quickly moved from this immediate instigation to the broadest question of formalism vs. function­alism — an issue that cannot be resolved as total victory or defeat. Moreover, the debate embodied a hundred subtexts in sociology, philosophy, and poli­tics — open vs. closed meetings of the Academie, facts vs. theory in science, elites vs. populism in research — and all these swirling, largely orthogonal themes could not fall into a single pattern of victory for one side.

Furthermore, and in a curious sense, the debate didn't seem so tumultuous, fierce, or epochal at the moment of its actual unfolding — six meetings, two misses, and an abrupt, unfinished ending. This incident became central to the later history of biology largely through machinations and unplanned conse­quences of its aftermath, and primarily because a mixture of good luck and a special kind of insight allowed the dreamer Geoffroy to recoup everything he had lost in immediate debate to the magisterial Cuvier, and to attain some sort of victory in retrospect, or at least a “draw” with great advantages.

On the ledger of luck, Geoffroy gained history's greatest and most conventional form of advantage when Cuvier died in 1832, thus awarding Geoffroy 12 additional years to reconstruct the incident, unopposed and in his fashion (a kind of poetic justice in this case, since Cuvier had so adroitly used the same power with such effect — as in his infamous eloge of Lamarck, see pp. 170–173). Secondly, Geoffroy obtained the finest free publicity conceiv­able when Europe's greatest literary figure, the aged Goethe, expressed such





4-11. A remarkable artifact in the history of evolutionary biology! This is the title page of Cuvier's personal copy — a “gift” from Geoffroy — of the volume that Geoffroy so quickly edited and published after their debate of 1830 at the Academy of Sciences. (Author's collection.) I can find no evidence that Cuvier, after placing his library stamp upon this volume, ever read a word of the text. Following Cuvier's death, this book became the property of the Library of the Museum d'Histoire naturelle, which later sold it as a duplicate.)





lively interest in the debate and wrote two articles on the subject, including the very last piece before his death (Goethe, 1832). Although Goethe declared no victor, his basic sympathy lay with Geoffroy — a kindred soul who de­fended poetic insight against pure empiricism, and who had, in a real sense that inspired their deepest intellectual bond, completed for animals (with the archetypal vertebra) the program that Goethe had begun so brilliantly for plants (and their archetypal leaf).

The debate of Geoffroy and Cuvier unfolded during one of the most impor­tant and tumultuous events of 19th century French history — the revolution of 1830. This coincidence prompted the most famous anecdote of the entire epi­sode — a tale that documents the extent of Goethe's involvement. Goethe's friend Frederic Soret recalled:

The news of the Revolution ... reached Weimar today, and set everyone in a commotion. I went in the course of the afternoon to Goethe's. “Now,” he exclaimed as I entered, “what do you think of this great event? The volcano has come to an eruption; everything is in flames, and we no longer have a transaction behind closed doors!” “A frightful story,” I replied. “But what else could be expected under such notorious circumstances, and with such a ministry, than that matters would end with the expulsion of the royal family?” “We do not appear to under­stand each other, my good friend,” replied Goethe. “I am not speaking of those people at all, but of something entirely different. I am speaking of the contest, of the highest importance for science, between Cuvier and Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, which has come to an open rupture in the Acad­emy” (quoted in Appel, 1987, p. 1).



In his first article (1831, p. 179), Goethe conjured up the scene of debate: “In this sanctuary of science . . . where all is order and decorum, where one encounters people of high culture, where one responds with moderation ... lively debate has broken out, debate which appears to lead only to personal dissention, but which, viewed from a higher perspective, has more value and more future worth.” He then epitomized the differences between the protago­nists in both method and theory (1831, p. 180): “Cuvier presents himself as having an indefatigable zeal for distinction and description . . . Geoffroy de­votes himself to the hidden affinities of creatures . . . The totality is always present in an interior sense, from which follows the conviction that the par­ticular can arise from the totality.”

Goethe also recognized the link between a commitment to formalist constraints and channels, and a reluctance to explain morphology by utility and adaptation — for he had promoted the same correlation in his own work on plants. Presenting the most essential aspect of Geoffroy's methodology, Goethe writes (1832, p. 62): “It is necessary to cite, as most important, his having shown the uselessness of explanations in terms of final causes.”

Geoffroy surely enjoyed good fortune in Cuvier's death and Goethe's inter­est, but he also actively campaigned in an unconventional yet strikingly effec­tive manner, for elevating the importance of the debate and rewriting its story to his advantage. As stated above, his book of documents went to the printers just 10 days after the debate ended. Although he did not importune Goethe directly, he surely took full advantage of this fortuitous involvement (see Fig. 4-8 for some private evidence). Speaking before the Academie later in 1830, Geoffroy noted Goethe's favorable commentary on his “instant” book, refer­ring to the great poet as “the first authority of Germany . . . the celebrated Goethe . . . who has just accorded my work the greatest honor that a French book can receive” (quoted in Appel, 1987, pp. 166-167).

Taking a cue from Goethe's clout, Geoffroy actively recruited support from literary leaders in France. Balzac dedicated Fere Goriot, perhaps his most fa­mous novel, “to the great and illustrious Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire as a tribute of admiration for his labors and his genius.” The avantpropos to Balzac's La comedie humaine (1842) contains the following description of Geoffroy's sys­tem:

There is only one animal. The Creator has used only a single pattern for all organized beings. The animal is a principle, which takes its exter­nal form, or, to be more exact, the differences in its form, from the mi­lieus in which it is obliged to develop. Zoological species are the result of these differences. The proclamation and defense of this system, which is, moreover, in harmony with our ideas of divine power, will be the eternal glory of Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, the victor over Cuvier in this point of higher science, and whose triumph has been hailed by the last article written by the great Goethe (in Appel, 1987, p. 192).



Balzac then used Geoffroy's centerpiece, in a timely and fascinating way, in this and other novels — arguing that all people partake of a single human es­sence, with individual variation best explained by environmental differences.

Geoffroy also courted the friendship and publicity of George Sand. Of a meeting with Geoffroy at the Jardin des Plantes in 1836, she wrote: “The old Geoffroy is for his part a rather curious beast, as ugly as the orangutan, as talkative as a magpie, but for all that full of genius” (in Appel, 1987, p. 189). Geoffroy sent Sand several of his publications; she declared herself unable to do them technical justice, but still proclaimed them “broad and magnificent,” throwing Cuvier “to the ground ... for anyone who detests meanness in the arts” (in Appel, 1987, p. 189).

So many questions about historical influence find their best resolution in our understanding of time frames and time scales. Cuvier may have won at least a rhetorical victory in a scientific debate of great intellectual import but limited duration and public impact during two months in 1830. But this event in clock time then yielded to a literary tradition of retelling, orches­trated in large part by the sole surviving protagonist. The original technical issues evoked little interest or understanding among the chief literary retellers who, in Appel's words (1987, p. 175), “came to see Geoffroy as a heroic fig­ure, Cuvier as a paltry fact collector, and the debate as a major event in French intellectual history.”

What version, then, should we embrace if we must address the largely meaningless, but endlessly fascinating, issue of “who won?” Something hap­pened in 1830; a factual basis of word and gesture once unfolded. But we cannot recover the original scene, and the actual debate would be subject to endless interpretation in any case. If later judgments and interpolations loom so large in the mythological versions learned and accepted by students for nearly two centuries since the actual events (and I use “mythological” in the primal and powerful, not the pejorative, sense) — Geoffroy's triumph among the literati, Cuvier's in most scientific accounts — then these constructions re­place the unattainable original and become an important reality in their own right.

Finally (as I shall stress throughout this book), in the deepest sense, and by a plethora of disparate criteria, neither Geoffroy nor Cuvier could have “won” because neither man held tools of triumph in principle. Formalism and functionalism represent poles of a timeless dichotomy, each expressing a valid way of representing reality. Both poles can only be regarded as deeply right, and each needs the other because the full axis of the dichotomy oper­ates as a lance thrown through, and then anchoring, the empirical world. If one pole “wins” for contingent reasons of a transient historical moment, then the advantage can only be temporary and intellectually limited. Such an ephemeral victory did occur in the recent history of evolutionary theory — the exaltation of functionalism in the hardening adaptationism of the Mod­ern Synthesis, codified in the late 1950's and early 1960's, and marked by cel­ebrations of the Darwinian centennial in 1959 (see Chapter 7). In fact, this very historical context led me to emphasize structuralism and formalism in this book (because its insights have been neglected in modern evolutionary biology, not because formalist approaches could ever be labeled as “more true”), and to revivify the great formalist thinkers, from Geoffroy to Owen to Galton, Bateson, and Goldschmidt — not as an antiquarian indulgence, but for the current utility of their ideas. (Other ages have needed to rescue func­tionalism from equally limited formalist domination.)

But I would not spend so much time on this endeavor for reasons of selfish and personal interest alone. Formalism resartus has been externally moti­vated by great advances in genetics and development (see Chapters 10 and 11) — a system of knowledge that requires a structure of explanation based as much on how organisms can be built, as on how they do work. We should give the last word to Goethe who, in choosing the debate between Geoffroy and Cuvier for his swansong to the world, eloquently defended the claims of both men. He wrote primarily of ideas and facts, but also of archetype and adaptation, arguing that “the more vitally these two functions of the mind are related, like inhaling and exhaling, the better will be the outlook for the sciences and their friends.”





RICHARD OWEN AND ENGLISH FORMALISM: THE ARCHETYPE

OF VERTEBRATES





No formalism please, we're British


I own a letter (see Fig. 4-12) written in October 1879 by Richard Owen and addressed simply: “J. Pearson Langshaw, Esq. (in or near) Lancaster.” The stamp cost only a penny, and Her Majesty's post managed to make the deliv­ery with such minimal information. Owen announced that he had a “crowlet to pluck” with his friend for not visiting on a recent excursion near his where­abouts (Owen suspected a fear of further humiliation at the checkerboard as the reason for Langshaw's avoidance). Owen then spoke of a visit to Ireland, describing a new locality for Megaceros (the “Irish Elk”), and noting that Britain had formed part of a mainland during Pleistocene low sea levels. He ended with a note of chauvinism at the height of British imperial and indus­trial expansion: “I very much enjoyed a fortnight with the Tory Member for the County of Wicklow; visited a new locality of Megaceros, confirmatory of its antiquity, and coevality with the Elephants and Rhinoceroses which roamed over the continent represented now by certain Islands that set the rest of the world to rights.”

Yet, for all his political and institutional allegiance to his native land, Brit­ain's greatest vertebrate anatomist cast his intellectual lot with the continent that lay abreast of those “certain islands” and championed the strongest ver­sion of formalism — the theory of single generating archetypes, at least for all vertebrates — in the land so well adapted for the functionalism of Paley and the Bridgewater Treatises.* Owen sensed his incongruity and recognized that his formalist message would be better heard in France or Germany than in his own country. On the very first page of his greatest formalist monograph, On the Nature of Limbs (1849), Owen wrote: “I became fully conscious how for­eign to our English philosophy were those ideas or trains of thought con­cerned in the discovery of the anatomical truths, one of which I propose to explain on the present occasion in reference to the limbs or locomotive extremities. A German anatomist, addressing an audience of his countrymen, would feel none of the difficulty which I experienced” (1849, p. 1). And when Owen attempted to secure a German translation of this work, he wrote to Rudolf Wagner of Gottingen (quoted in Desmond, 1982, p. 48): “The subject is better adapted for the character of mind and thought of a German audience than for our matter of fact English.”

As Ospovat (1981) and other scholars have shown, Owen was not the only British scientist who caught (and rode) the wave of formalist excitement emanating





4-12. For one penny and a very approximate address, the British postal service managed to deliver Richard Owen's letter to his friend Langshaw. (Author's collection.) Note his playful, but quite chauvinistic comments about England versus the continent on the last page of the letter.





from the continent; in such a strongly social profession as science, even the most profoundly idiosyncratic thinker lies embedded in his contemporary world (see Chapter 11 on the leading 20th century British formalist, D'Arcy Thompson). Yet, as I have emphasized throughout this chapter — for the theme must play a central role in any proper understanding of Darwin and the essence of Darwinian theory — formalism remained a minority position in Britain, poorly adapted and fundamentally alien to a culture freighted with several centuries of functionalist preference.

As a fitting illustration of this functionalist milieu, consider Britain's pre­eminent philosopher of science in the generation of Owen and Darwin: Wil­liam Whewell. (As author of a Bridgewater Treatise, Whewell cannot be considered a neutral commentator.) The first edition (1837) of his most im­portant and comprehensive work, History of the Inductive Sciences, presents a functionalist perspective, almost as rigid and exclusive as Paley's. By the third edition (1869), however, Whewell claimed a change of heart, stating that Owen had provoked the alteration. Yet Whewell's “revised” attitude re­mains quintessential functionalist, if anything even more so because he now recognizes and understands the formalist alternative, but relegates this “new­comer” to marginality. Whewell begins by providing a fair and concise con­trast of the two schools as portrayed in the debate between Geoffroy and Cuvier — though he scarcely hides his preferences in judging functionalism as “truths which are irresistibly apparent and which may therefore be safely taken as the bases of our reasonings”:

According to this theory [Geoffroy's], the structure and functions of animals are to be studied by the guidance of their analogy only [homology in modern parlance]; our attention is to be turned, not to the fitness of the organization for any end of life or action, but to its resemblance of the other organizations by which it is gradually derived from the original type ... On the other hand, the plan of the animal, the purpose of its or­ganization in the support of its life, the necessity of the functions to its existence, are truths which are irresistibly apparent, and which may therefore be safely taken as the bases of our reasonings. This view has been put forward as the doctrine of the conditions of existence: it may also be described as the principle of a purpose in organization; the struc­ture being considered as having the function for its end (1869, p. 483).



Whewell then states the chief claim for functionalist primacy: body parts exist primarily “for” their useful action: “That the parts of the body of ani­mals are made in order to discharge their respective offices, is a conviction which we cannot believe to be otherwise than an irremovable principle of the philosophy of organization, when we see the manner in which it has con­stantly forced itself upon the minds of zoologists and anatomists in all ages” (1869, p. 489). “In the organized world,” Whewell adds (1869, p. 491), “we may and must adopt the belief, that organization exists for its purpose, and that the apprehension of the purpose may guide us in seeing the meaning of the organization.”

Whewell ends with a striking musical analogy, arguing that formalism conveys a certain pleasure and appreciation, but that full delight and instruction require apprehension in terms of purpose:

To us this doctrine [of final causes or functionalism] appears like the natural cadence of the tones to which we have so long been listening: and without such a final strain our ears would have been left craving and unsatisfied. We have been lingering long amid the harmonies of law and symmetry, constancy and development; and these notes, though their music was sweet and deep, must too often have sounded to the ear of our moral nature, as vague and unmeaning melodies, floating in the air around us, but conveying no definite thought, molded into no intelligible announcement (1869, p. 495).





The vertebrate archetype: constraint and nonadaptation


All biologists know that Richard Owen defined the terms analogy and homology in their modern sense, and that he made a tripartite division of the second category into general, special and serial (thus demonstrating the gen­erative and developmental, rather than the evolutionary, basis of his underly­ing concept — see Chapter 10, pp. 1070–1076, for an extensive analysis of Owen's categories in the light of modern developmental biology). With this framework, constructed specifically in the light of the formalist-functionalist debate, Owen could engage the problem that Darwin would later designate as paramount in morphology — the special homology of similar parts with di­vergent functions. “What can be more curious,” Darwin would write (1859, p. 434 and p. 112 of this book), “than that the hand of a man, formed for grasping, that of a mole for digging, the leg of the horse, the paddle of the porpoise, and the wing of the bat, should all be constructed on the same pat­tern.”

Surely, Owen reasoned, these underlying structural similarities could not be explained by common utility — the category that he had designated as “analogy.” And thus, the “British Cuvier” explicitly contradicted the central belief of his eponym by denying a functional explanation for homology: “The attempt to explain, by the Cuvierian principles, the facts of special homology on the hypothesis of the subserviency of the parts so determined to similar ends in different animals — to say that the same or answerable bones occur in them because they have to perform similar functions — involve [sic] many dif­ficulties, and are opposed by numerous phenomena” (Owen, 1848, p. 73).

Owen clearly accepts the common conceptual taxonomy of his generation, for he argues that functionalism and formalism represent the only intelligible interpretations of morphology. We rightly reject functionalism for special homology, but if we deny formalism as well, then we retain, for explanation, nothing but a stochastic “slough of despond”: “With regard to the structural correspondences manifested in the locomotive members; if the principle of special adaptation fails to explain them, and we reject the idea of these corre­spondences as manifestations of some archetypal exemplar on which it has pleased the Creator to frame certain of his living creatures, there remains only the alternative that the organic atoms have concurred fortuitously to produce such harmony. But from this Epicurean slough of despond every healthy mind naturally recoils” (1849, p. 40).

Owen chooses the formalist exit from Bunyan's swamp, and calls upon the guidance of Plato to pull him out (an even classier assist than Dante's employ­ment of Virgil). Special homology can only be resolved by recognizing the common generating pattern for all specific manifestations — the Platonic ar­chetype (or general homology) behind the variety of worldly incarnations. The archetype does not denote an object or an ancestor, but an abstract generating formula, a blueprint, and a formal cause. Owen engraved his ver­sion of the vertebrate archetype upon a seal and wrote to his sister Maria in 1852, trying to explain this arcane concept in layperson's terms: “It repre­sents the archetype, or primal pattern — what Plato would have called the 'di­vine idea' on which the osseous frame of all vertebrate animals — i.e. all ani­mals that have bones — has been constructed. The motto is 'the one in the manifold,' expressive of the unity of plan which may be traced through all the modifications of the pattern, by which it is adapted to the very habits and modes of life of fishes, reptiles, birds, beasts, and human kind” (in Owen, 1894, vol. 1, p. 388).

In 1849, Owen published his treatise, On the Nature of Limbs, originally delivered as a lecture on February 9 at the Royal Institution. I regard this book as the best expression of Owen's archetypal theory, the most interesting document ever written in English to defend this strongest version of formalist theory in biology.

Despite the title (aptly chosen and cleverly constructed as we shall see), Owen's treatise attempts to reduce the entire vertebrate skeleton, in all its manifold variety, to a single archetypal element, multiply repeated and spe­cialized. Owen writes: “General anatomical science reveals the unity which pervades the diversity, and demonstrates the whole skeleton of man to be the harmonized sum of a series of essentially similar segments, although each segment differs from the other, and all vary from their archetype” (1849, p. 119).

For the naming and essence of this archetypal element, Owen agrees with Geoffroy in designating the vertebra. We must conceptualize Owen's “verte­bra” not only as a spinal disc, but as a set of highly generalized elements (a central disc surrounded by various bars and rods) ripe for modification along myriad pathways. Owen's archetypal unit (Fig. 4-13) operates as an abstract blueprint of bursting potential. (For example, in the “vertebra” that makes the shoulder girdle, the pleurapophysis lateral to the centrum becomes the scapula, while the haemapophysis below forms the coracoid, and the lower­most haemal spine makes the front of the sternum.) Owen writes: “I have sat­isfactorily demonstrated that a vertebra is a natural group of bones, that it may be recognized as a primary division or segment of the endoskeleton, and that the parts of that group are definable and recognizable under all their teleological modifications, their essential relations and characters appearing through every adaptive mask.” (Note the strong claim — the key and continu­ing relevance of formalism in critiquing Darwinian traditions — that any spe­cialization for utility, or “teleological modification,” imposes an “adaptive mask” upon the generating archetype. In such phrases, we grasp the essential difference between formalism and functionalism. Adaptive modification, the architect of morphology in Darwinian functionalism, becomes, in formalist thought, a secondary, superficial and confusing overprint upon the underly­ing essence.)

For anyone wishing to explain the human skeleton by genesis from a verte­bral archetype, three great groups of bones must be resolved in different ways and with varying degrees of difficulty: the vertebral column itself, the skull, and the limbs with their associated girdles. The archetypal model obviously works for the vertebral column, the empirical source of the theory in the first place. The skull and the limbs therefore become crucial experiments for test­ing the model of archetypal genesis.

The attempt to depict the skull as a profound modification of a few verte­brae substantially predates Owen (see p. 283 on Goethe's allegiance, dating from observations on a sheep's skull made in 1790). The subject had been much aired and debated, with the number of proposed vertebrae ranging from one (Dumeril in 1808) to seven (Geoffroy). The most common resolu­tion proposed four vertebrae, a number popularized by Oken and accepted by Owen. Oken had named the four elements from back to front — occipi­tal, parietal, frontal, and nasal — and he had associated each with a primary sense: auditory, lingual, ocular, and olfactory. Owen accepted these four names. He argued that lateral and ventral elements of the occipital vertebra

formed the pectoral girdle. He kept Oken's names — parietal, frontal, and na­sal — for neural halves of the three anterior vertebrae, and designated the haemal (ventral) halves by their associated structures: hyoid, mandibular, and maxillary.

Having thus resolved one of the two problematic bone groups by tradi­tional arguments, Owen turned to the single remaining issue for completion of the archetypal research program — the explanation of limbs and associated girdles as modified vertebral parts. In this sense, The Nature of Limbs should not be read as a specialized treatise on one part of the body, but as an attempt to complete the most radical version of formalism by bringing the last out­post of the vertebrate skeleton under the vertebral archetype.

Owen's argument for limbs might strike us today as contrived and peculiar. His effort does not represent the high water mark of formalist logic even in its own terms and times, but may still win our grudging respect for ingenious-ness and pure chutzpah. The apparent problem, after all, can only be de­scribed as daunting. After using all the lateral and ventral parts of a vertebra to build the girdle, what remains for constructing the prominent complexity of humerus, radius and ulna, carpals and metacarpals, right down to the most distal phalanx of the digits? Surely these bones can only be “novel” structures unrelated to the archetypal vertebra, and the integrative program of arche­typal reduction and genesis must fail. We might choose to downplay the su­pernumerary status of a stapes or hyoid bone; but we can scarcely disregard the need to encompass limbs within any general theory of the vertebrate skel­eton — for an archetype that omits such a major structure can only provide a partial and paltry explanation indeed.

Owen's improbable solution homologizes the vertebrate limb, in all its complexity, with a simple, unbranched projection from the haemapophysis (see Fig. 4-13), called a diverging ray (note the ray on each vertebra of the ar­chetype in Fig. 4-14).

But how could Owen justify a comparison of so many articulated bones with a hypothetical single rod? Owen used the time-honored comparative method by attempting to trace back the complexity of vertebrate limbs in a structural series of simplification, leading to the lungfish Lepidosiren and its minimal pectoral ray. Lest this series be rejected as a concatenation of hetero­geneous objects, Owen presented a tripartite argument: (1) the structural se­ries denotes a descent by simplification; (2) simplification occurs by “arrest of development,” bringing the reduced form closer to an embryonic state; (3) the embryo, following von Baer's principles, reveals the generating archetype in a way that the complexly modified adult cannot. Sensing that opponents might view the proposition as a “transcendental dream,” Owen defended his structural series (Fig. 4-15) as a voyage to the archetype: “It is no mere tran­scendental dream, but true knowledge and legitimate fruit of inductive re­search, that clear insight into the essential nature of the organ, which is ac­quired by tracing it step by step from the unbranched pectoral ray of the lepidosiren to the equally small and slender but bifid pectoral ray of the amphiuma, thence to the similar but trifid ray of the proteus and through the

In his boldest move, Owen attempts to derive the entire limb of later vertebrates from the single diverging ray of each vertebral element in the archetypal form. The diverging ray is the little spike projecting upward at about 10 o'clock from the junction of two vertical elements below each vertebral centrum of the archetype. (Author's collection.)





progressively superadded structures and perfections in higher reptiles and in mammals” (p. 70).

But these strained homologies then incur a second, equally serious problem in requiring a pronounced shift of position among vertebrate classes — an interpretation inconsistent with the formalist principle that topology and connection serve as the primary criteria of homology. Geoffroy had developed his concept of metastasis (see p. 300) to explain exceptions in the same trou­bling example, and Owen followed this continental solution. The pectoral girdle of fishes attaches to the rear of the skull. In fact, Owen regarded the bones of the girdle as the haemal portions of the fourth, or occipital, skull vertebra. (The arm and hand arise from the diverging ray of this vertebra and also become parts of the head by homology.) Owen recognizes the counter­intuitive oddity of such a claim, but must follow the formalist logic: “How­ever strange and paradoxical the proposition may sound, the scapular arch and its appendages, down the last phalanx of the little finger, are truly and essentially bones of the skull” (p. 112).

But all tetrapods separate the shoulder girdle and front appendages from the skull by a sequence of intercalated vertebrae. Owen argues, as did Geoffroy, that the haemal portion of the fourth skull vertebra has migrated back in the terrestrial classes. And why should this degree of transposition be





4-15. Owen justifies his bold claim that the entire limb might be derived from a diverging ray by showing a series of maximally reduced limbs in living verte­brates from Proteus with several elements but only two digits, to Amphiuma, also with two digits but fewer elements, and finally to Lepidosiren with a single element maximally similar to the hypothetical diverging ray. (Author's collection).





regarded as improbable? After all, the pelvic fin of many living teleost fishes, the undeniable serial homolog of the pectoral, moves sufficiently far forward to lie in front of the pectoral. If this more radical movement occurs in modern species, why balk at a less profound metastasis to separate forelimb from skull? “But it may be objected that the ordinary costal or haemal arch has been detached from its centrum for the purpose of this comparison. True! And the scapular arch in mammals, birds and reptiles, is a haemal arch so dis­located, — a statement which I do not hesitate to make under a pledge to dem­onstrate the proper centrum and the rest of the segment or vertebra to which it belongs” (p. 50).

Having thus brought the entire skeleton, with all its complexity and adap­tive variety, into homology with the archetypal vertebra, Owen could pro­claim both the glory and the generality of formalist morphology. On the largely rhetorical subject of glory, Owen joined Agassiz in refuting the Paleyan link of functionalism to God's beneficence. Shall we not regard a gen­eralized archetype, a sublime and abstract pattern for all manifest variety, as a loftier testimony to a truly omnipotent God than the mean material fitting, however exact, of some unique and particular object to an immediate envi­ronment? “The satisfaction felt by the rightly constituted mind must ever be great in recognizing the fitness of parts for their appropriate functions; but when this fitness is gained, as in the great toe of the foot of man or the ostrich, by a structure which at the same time betokens harmonious concord with a common type, the prescient operation of the One Cause of all organization becomes strikingly manifested to our limited intelligence” (p. 38).

Archetypal thinking also exalts our own status, for if God ordained the archetype, he certainly recognized all potential modifications in advance, and the concept of human existence therefore long predated our actual appear­ance: “The recognition of an ideal Exemplar for the vertebrated animals proves that the knowledge of such a being as man must have existed before man appeared. For the Divine mind which planned the Archetype also fore­knew all its modifications” (pp. 85-86).

In fact, the entire geological history of vertebrates may be interpreted as a movement towards humanity, guided by natural forces ordained by God as secondary causes. Owen's oft-quoted last paragraph provides a genuine ex­pression of evolutionary views in this limited sense (transformations within an archetypal framework under unknown, but natural, laws established by God to implement His plans of progress):

To what natural laws or secondary causes the orderly succession and progression of such organic phenomena may have been committed we as yet are ignorant. But if, without derogation of the Divine power, we may conceive the existence of such ministers, and personify them by the term “Nature,” we learn from the past history of our globe that she has advanced with slow and stately steps, guided by the archetypal light, amidst the wreck of worlds, from the first embodiment of the Vertebrate idea under its old Ichthyic vestment, until it became arrayed in the glori­ous garb of the Human form (p. 86).



Owen drew from his archetype all the standard implications that set the research program of formalism — the correlations that define the essence (and continuing relevance) of this pole on the dichotomy: importance of constraint and mistrust of adaptationism (accompanied by demotion to secondary sta­tus).

Constraint. This term includes two distinct meanings, both in vernac­ular English usage (see Gould, 1989a, and Chapter 10, pp. 1025–1061) and in biological jargon — the negative concept of restriction, and the positive sense of channeling. Those who belittle the evolutionary importance of the subject do not deny the phenomenon itself, but rather limit their concept to the negative meaning.

Owen properly depicted constraint as both limitation and channeling. In the former meaning, for example, he notes that the first digit of the general­ized mammalian hand or foot develops only two phalanges, while the others grow three. These numbers do not change, even when utility would dictate otherwise — as in elephants where the first and fifth toes do not differ in length, and all digits are enclosed in a large pad (1849, p. 37); or in humans, where the first toe becomes massive and weight-bearing (but cannot gain an additional phalanx), and the little toe almost vestigial (while still retaining its full complement of three phalanges).

On the positive theme of channels, Owen regards an archetype as a blue­print of myriad possibilities (made all the more intelligible by limiting their range to products of common elements in unvarying topological order). All realized examples on earth therefore include only a small subset of possible forms. Owen even felt free to speculate about the anatomy of life on other worlds, provided that the vertebral archetype can lay claim to universal sta­tus: “Our thoughts are free to soar as far as any legitimate analogy may seem to guide them rightly in the boundless ocean of unknown truth. And if cen­sure be merited for here indulging, even for a moment, in pure speculation, it may, perhaps, be disarmed by the reflection that the discovery of the verte­brate archetype could not fail to suggest to the anatomist many possible mod­ifications of it beyond those that we know to have been realized in this little orb of ours” (1849, p. 83).

For example, no earthly vertebrate grows more than two pairs of limbs, but the archetype bears diverging rays (the source of limbs by general homology), on each vertebra, and additional pairs therefore become possible:

We have been accustomed to regard the vertebrate animals as being characterized by the limitation of their limbs to two pairs, and it is true that no more diverging appendages are developed for station, locomotion and manipulation. But the rudiments of many more pairs are present in many species. Although they may never be developed as such in this planet, it is quite conceivable that certain of them may be so developed, if the Vertebrate type should be that on which any of the inhabitants of other planets of our system are organized. The conceivable modifications of the vertebrate archetype are very far from being exhausted by any of the forms that now inhabit the earth, or that are known to have existed here at any period (1849, p. 83).



Adaptation. Neither Owen nor any prominent formalist has ever de­nied interest or importance to the manifestly obvious phenomenon of adapta­tion. Formalists do not question the high frequency of adaptation, but only dispute the relative ranking of utility as a causal argument. In the view of functionalists, from creationists like Paley to evolutionists like Darwin, adap­tation embodies the source and cause of morphological order and change. For formalists, adaptation becomes a secondary phenomenon, imposed upon primary and underlying laws of form to fit a particular organism to an imme­diate environment. Adaptation remains vital; for without such specific utility, the organic world would feature only abstract models, but no real creatures in their stunning variety. Yet, adaptation still works in a sequential and sec­ondary fashion to place an overlay upon the archetype. Thus, while Owen continually speaks of morphology and teleology, we must not view him as a mushy pluralist, advocating equality of the two poles. His mode of blending ranks the poles, with adaptation distinctly subservient to archetype in the classical mixture of formalist thought.

Owen argued that two great laws build actual organisms from the arche­typal form. The first, called irrelative (or vegetative) repetition, iterates the ar­chetypal element into a series of similar parts. The second, adaptive or teleological force then modifies the various segments in different ways demanded by their mode of life.

Since the adaptive force imposes secondary modifications upon an initial string of identical archetypal elements, we must penetrate behind this im­posed veil of specific utility and specialization if we wish to apprehend the ar­chetype itself. Various formalist principles lead us to fruitful strategies for peering behind the adaptive mask: embryos as more archetypal than adults; early and simple forms as closer than later and more complex creatures, fol­lowing “the law that the Archetype is progressively departed from as the or­ganization is more and more modified in adaptation to higher and more var­ied powers and actions” (p. 49).

This secondary and derivative character of adaptation leads to a linguistic convention of structuralism, where functional fit becomes an impediment to research upon laws of form. The movement of the tetrapod forelimb away from its initial position within the last vertebra of the skull, for example, shows “the antagonizing power of adaptive modification by the removal of that arch from its proper segment” (p. 59). We focus on embryos and simple anatomies in our study of the archetype because, in these forms, “the arche­type is least obscured by purposive adaptations” (p. 55).

The derivative nature of adaptation also debars this important phenome­non from any role as a primary organizing principle of morphology. Owen begins his treatise with an incisive argument, cutting to the heart of Paley's error in ignoring relationships among organisms and speaking only of partic­ular designs and their individual excellences. Using Paley's own device of analogy to machines, Owen undermines functionalism from within. Manu­factured structures may be individually optimized for their utility; therefore, such contrivances of human technology will not be strongly constrained by homological elements of common design. If organisms had been similarly built on mechanical principles of optimality in adaptation, they would show more structural variation, and not be morphologically clustered as varied manifestations of archetypes. The archetypes themselves, therefore, cannot represent principles of merely functional design:

To break its ocean-bounds, the islander fabricates his craft, and glides over the water by means of the oar, the sail, or the paddle wheel. To quit the dull earth man inflates the balloon, and soars aloft, and, perhaps, en­deavors to steer or guide his course by the action of broad expanded sheets, like wings. With the arched shield and the spade or pick he bores the tunnel: and his modes of accelerating his speed in moving over the surface of the ground are many and various. But by whatever means or instruments man aids, or supersedes, his natural locomotive organs, such instruments are adapted expressly and immediately to the end proposed. He does not fetter himself by the trammels of any common type of loco­motive instrument, and increase his pains by having to adjust the parts and compensate their proportions, so as best to perform the end required without deviating from the pattern previously laid down for all.... Nor should we anticipate, if animated in our researches by the quest of final causes in the belief that they were the sole governing principle of organi­zation, a much greater amount of conformity in the construction of the natural instruments by means of which these different elements are tra­versed by different animals. The teleologist would rather expect to find the same direct and purposive adaptation of the limb to its office as in the machine (1849, pp. 9-10).



Moreover, to stress the key methodological point, immediate utility does not imply design for a current end. Complex shapes and anatomies, devel­oped under formalist rules of structural transformation, may find utility after arising for nonadaptive reasons. The delayed fusion of mammalian skull bones may now serve as a prerequisite for parturition through a small birth canal, but birds and reptiles show a similar delay, and this “adaptive” feature did not arise “for” its current and indispensable use in mammals:

I think it will be obvious that the principle of final adaptation fails to sat­isfy all the conditions of the problem. That every segment in almost every bone which is present in the human hand and arm should exist in the fin of the whale, solely because it is assumed that they were required in such number and collocation for the support and movements of that undi­vided and inflexible paddle, squares as little with our idea of the simplest mode of effecting the purpose, as the reason which might be assigned for the great number of bones in the cranium of the chick, viz. to allow the safe compression of the brain case during the act of exclusion, squares with the requirements of that act. Such a final purpose is indeed readily perceived and admitted in regard of the multiplied points of ossification of the skull of the human fetus, and their relation to safe parturition, but when we find that the same ossific centers are established, and in similar order, in the skull of the embryo kangaroo, which is born when an inch in length, and in that of the callow bird that breaks the brittle egg, we feel the truth of Bacon's comparison of “final causes” to the Vestal Vir­gins, and perceive that they would be barren and unproductive of the fruits we are laboring to attain, and would yield us no clue to the com­prehension of that law of conformity of which we are in quest (1849, pp. 39-40).





Owen and Darwin


The changing and uncertain relationship between Darwin and Owen presents an intriguing story in Victorian scientific sociology. Darwin's statement in his autobiography has been frequently quoted: “I often saw Owen, whilst living in London, and admired him greatly, but was never able to understand his character and never became intimate with him. After the publication of the Origin of Species he became my bitter enemy, not owing to any quarrel be­tween us, but as far as I could judge out of jealousy at its success.”

Owen and Darwin first met for professional reasons after Darwin's return on the Beagle: Darwin had gathered the material (important bones of South American fossil mammals), and Owen possessed the anatomical skills. Lyell wrote to Owen on October 26, 1836, inviting him to dinner: “Among others you will meet Mr. Charles Darwin, whom I believe you have seen, just re­turned from South America, where he has labored for zoologists as well as for hammer-bearers” (in Owen, 1894, vol. 1, p. 102). The two men met and liked each other well enough. Darwin entrusted his Beagle material to his anatomi­cal colleague, and Owen became the taxonomic author of Toxodon and Dar­win's other spectacular finds.

Their later antagonism arose for several reasons, some obvious, others less clear. Owen could surely be devious, arrogant and unpleasant. Darwin had struck a blow to the heart of Owen's system by substituting a flesh and blood ancestor, a concrete beastly thing, for the lovely, abstract, Platonic archetype. But something deeper and more intellectually honorable than simple jealousy lay at the core of their growing antipathy.

Owen often enters the false dichotomies of standard histories as a virulent antievolutionist, the man who whispered into Wilberforce's ear before the famous debate with T. H. Huxley. If true, simple jealousy might provide an adequate motive: he who overturns my world, and (implicitly at least) makes me a fool in a profession I once dominated, can scarcely remain my compan­ion. Darwin contributed to this impression of Owen as a special creationist by so identifying him in the Origin and other writings — and Darwin cannot be entirely blamed for this mischaracterization. For Owen, never the clearest of writers, and ever the diplomat in an aristocratic world where he hob­nobbed with skill as a social climber and a seeker of support for his Museum, could be infuriatingly opaque in his stated commitments. In fact, Darwin, al­though characteristically genial and conciliatory to a fault in his writings, permitted himself a rare burst of trenchant irony in expressing his frustration at Owen's slippery attitude toward evolution. In the historical sketch added to later editions of the Origin, Darwin wrote:

When the first edition of this work was published, I was so completely deceived, as were many others, by such expressions as “the continuous operation of creative power,” that I included Professor Owen with other paleontologists as being firmly convinced of the immutability of species; but it appears that this was on my part a preposterous error. In the last edition of this work, I inferred, and the inference still seems to me per­fectly just, . . . that Professor Owen admitted that natural selection may have done something in the formation of a new species; but this it ap­pears is inaccurate and without evidence. I also gave some extracts from a correspondence between Professor Owen and the editor of the “Lon­don Review” from which it appeared manifest to the editor as well as to myself, that Professor Owen claimed to have promulgated the theory of natural selection before I had done so; and I expressed my surprise and satisfaction at this announcement; but as far as it is possible to un­derstand certain recently published passages I have either partially or wholly again fallen into error. It is consolatory to me that others find Professor Owen's controversial writings as difficult to understand and to reconcile with each other, as I do (Darwin, 1872b, pp. xvii-xviii).



One can certainly appreciate Darwin's frustrations. Owen did tailor his statements to circumstances and audiences, appearing cautious or critical as the case warranted, and always taking as much credit as possible. For exam­ple, Owen wrote a particularly nasty notice of the Origin in the April 1860 issue of the Edinburgh Review (published anonymously, following the tradi­tion of several leading journals at the time. Guessing the identity of review­ers — not at all difficult in this case — became a favorite Victorian intellectual pastime).

In this commentary, Owen did proclaim the origin of species as the greatest of biological problems: “The origin of species is the question of questions in zoology; the supreme problem which the most untiring of our original la­borers, the clearest zoological thinkers, and the most successful generalizers have never lost sight of, whilst they have approached it with due reverence” (Owen, 1860, in Hull, 1973, p. 77).

Writing anonymously, Owen praised himself as Darwin's unacknowledged predecessor in accepting the fact of evolution, but more cautious, and there­fore more worthy and philosophical, on the question of mechanisms:

The great names to which the steady inductive advance of zoology has been due during these periods, have kept aloof from any hypothesis on the origin of species. One only, in connection with his paleontological discoveries, with his development of the law of irrelative repetition and of homologies, including the relation of the latter to an archetype, has pronounced in favor of the view of the origin of species by continuously operative creational law; but he, at the same time, has set forth some of the strongest objections or exceptions to the hypothesis of the nature of that law as a progressively and gradually transmutational one (Owen, 1860, in Hull, 1973, p. 184).



Lest the term “creational law” still seem ambiguous, and lest anyone put the wrong name to the description, Owen later became more explicit. (In the jargon of Owen's day, a secondary cause operated under natural law, thus representing the subject matter of science. God, as “first cause,” may have es­tablished natural laws, and therefore secondary causes, at the beginning of time, but nature then unfolds under these invariable laws, thus defining the domain of science): “Owen has long since stated his belief that some preor­dained law or secondary cause is operative in bringing about the change” (Owen, 1860, in Hull, 1973, p. 210).

I acknowledge Owen's opacity and shiftiness, but I also think that we should take him at face value here, for his claim follows his earlier writings, and also accords with the standard view of most formalist thinkers, espe­cially Geoffroy. I believe that Owen had, for more than a decade before the Origin appeared, accepted a limited form of evolution — within archetypes, and along channels preordained by archetypal constraints. He never accepted global transmutation, for his brand of limited evolution could not generate the archetypes themselves (which stand as primitive terms, or “givens” in his system), but could only produce variety within their permitted channels. I don't know how to read the famous last lines of the Nature of Limbs (see p. 322), except as a genuine statement of the usual formalist commitment to evolution in this admittedly restricted but entirely legitimate sense: “To what natural laws or secondary causes the orderly succession and progression of such organic phenomena may have been committed we are as yet ignorant. ... But if, without derogation of the Divine power, we may conceive the exis­tence of such ministers, and personify them by the term 'Nature' ...” (1849, p. 86).

If we thus accept Owen as at least a halfhearted evolutionist long before the Origin, then the basis of his unhappiness with Darwin becomes easier to grasp. Darwin mocked Owen's caution, consumed his precious arche­type, made evolution global, and then proposed a central mechanism of change (natural selection) in the functionalist mode, diametrically opposed to Owen's formalist inclinations. Owen despised the extent and character of Darwin's evolutionism, but not the idea of evolution itself. All ideologists know that the enemy within provokes more intellectual danger and emo­tional distress than the enemy without.

Consider Darwin's two principal apostasies from Owen's point of view. First, Darwin reconfigured the abstract archetype as a material ancestor, thus converting Platonism to materialism. Darwin wrote his challenge right in the margin of his personal copy of Owen's Nature of Limbs (quoted in Ospovat, 1981, p. 146): “I look at Owen's archetypes as more than ideal, as a real rep­resentation as far as the most consummate skill and loftiest generalization can represent the parent form of the Vertebrata.”

Second, and even more disturbingly, Darwin inverted Owen's system, and the entire formalist program, by explaining the archetype in functional terms as a congeries of past adaptations materially inherited by descendants. Dar­win practically mocked Owen's formalism in the crucial paragraph on p. 206 that I cited to introduce this chapter (pp. 251–257). For Darwin used the jar­gon of the formalist-functionalist dichotomy — unity of type vs. conditions of existence — and then sank the formalist pole (along with Owen's most pre­cious concept of the archetype) into the alien functionalist sea of natural se­lection. In an important sense, Owen vs. Darwin on evolution replays Geoffroy vs. Cuvier on morphology.

Others appreciated this reincarnation of formalism vs. functionalism, and cheered from the sidelines or within the fray. St. George Mivart, regarded by Darwin as his most cogent critic (see pp. 1218–1224), construed Owen's for­malism as a proper evolutionary exit from Darwin's bankrupt’s natural selec­tion:

Owen . . . spread abroad in England the perception that a deep sig­nificance underlies the structure of animals — a significance for which no stress or strain and no influence of heredity, and certainly no mere practi­cal utility, can account. The temporary overclouding of this perception through the retrograde influence of Darwin's hypothesis of “natural se­lection” is now slowly but surely beginning to pass away ... Homologies for which neither heredity nor utility will account reveal themselves in the limbs of chelonians, birds, beasts, and most notably in those of man (from an 1893 statement by Mivart quoted in Owen, 1894, vol. 2, pp. 94-95).



From the other side, Asa Gray understood Darwin's central contribution as the proper reintroduction of purpose, or functionalism, into biology. In 1874, Gray wrote to Nature (quoted in Ospovat, 1981, p. 148) that Darwin had done great service for biology by “bringing back to it teleology; so that, in­stead of morphology vs. teleology, we shall have morphology wedded to tele­ology” — in other words, functionalist hegemony by proper criteria of pri­macy and relative frequency. Darwin certainly appreciated the argument, for he wrote back to Gray: “What you say about teleology pleases me espe­cially.”

In his usual perceptive manner, Russell (1916, p. 78) wrote: “The problem as Geoffroy and Cuvier understood it was not an evolutionary one. But the problem exists unchanged for the evolutionist, and evolution theory is essen­tially an attempt to solve it in one direction or the other.” So the problem ap­peared to Owen and Darwin; and so it remains for us today.





Darwin's Strong but Limited Interest in Structural Constraint





DARWIN'S DEBT TO BOTH POLES OF THE DICHOTOMY





Darwin, who understood so well that all organisms must be shaped by their history, could scarcely build a great structure in the realm of ideas without subjecting his mental edifice to the same causal influences. Darwin's theory grew in the context of the formalist-functionalist struggle, and he knew and appreciated the issues and terminology (see Section I of this chapter).

A cardinal premise of this book holds that Darwin must be ranked in the functionalist line — for the causal mechanics of his theory grant such clear pri­macy to adaptation, however subtly the argument develops.* But any evolu­tionary theory, in adding a historical dimension to reshape the simpler world of the formalist-functionalist dichotomy, would necessarily draw upon both axes of the old system to build the new, orthogonal dimension of temporal change. In two senses, formalist thought included great potential to influence Darwin's evolutionary views.

First, and most obvious in its possibilities (though largely unrealized by Darwin, I shall argue), classical formalism, with its key concept of transformational channels within the bounds of archetypal design, followed a logic intrinsically favorable to a limited form of evolution, while the optimalist functionalism of Paley, or of Cuvier, rooted the impossibility of transmuta­tion in the core of their central argument (Cuvier on correlation of parts, for example). Many of the leading pre-Darwinian formalists supported evolution in this restricted sense — Geoffroy in France, Meckel in Germany, Owen in England. Yet, although Darwin could not have been isolated from this influ­ence, I see no strong evidence that his decision to embrace evolutionism de­rived from this source (Gruber and Barrett, 1974; Schweber, 1977; Sulloway, 1982). Moreover, the most prominent and fully elaborated evolutionary the­ory available to Darwin (however strongly he rejected the formulation — see pp. 192–197) resided in the opposite camp of Lamarck's functionalism. Finally, the content of Darwin's theory, from his earliest codification in 1838, stood clearly outside formalist thinking — both in replacing archetypes with flesh and blood ancestors built by adaptation, and in advocating the function­alism of natural selection itself.

Secondly, Ospovat (1981) presented the important thesis that Darwin's chief intellectual change within his theory of natural selection between codification in 1838 and publication in 1859, lay in abandoning an original be­lief in perfect adaptation, and in accepting the crucial concepts of relative ad­aptation (“locally better than”) and imperfection imposed by constraints of phyletic history — the argument that completed Darwin's rejection of Paleyan optimality, first in accepting evolution rather than God as the architect of morphology, and only later in recognizing that history implies imperfection in current design. I accept Ospovat's claim that this change must be interpreted as fundamental to the structure of Darwin's theory — see my own extended treatment of Darwin's crucial use of imperfection as primary evidence for evolution itself (pp. 111-116). Finally, Ospovat demonstrates that Owen's disparagement of teleology, and the formalist notion of constraint imparted by archetypes and rules for their transformation, played an important role in Darwin's shift of attitude.

If Owen's formalism influenced Darwin in this manner, then why should Darwin be placed so firmly in the functionalist line? The first and most defin­itive answer must cite the obvious statement that Darwin explicitly so identi­fied himself — in using the defining terms of the formalist-functionalist debate (unity of type vs. conditions of existence), and in declaring his allegiance to the functionalist proposition as a “higher law” subsuming unity of type as past adaptation (see pp. 251–260).

The broader reason lies in a decision to concentrate on the causal mechan­ics of explanatory theories for evolutionary change. Evolution opens its um­brella over a vast subject, with many concerns and meanings. Taxonomy of attitudes might designate several alternative criteria for subdivisions. I believe that the logic of the inner workings of the primary causal theory — the struc­ture of evolutionary theory, as I named this book — should hold primacy in definitions.* Darwin developed strong ideas about history, attitudes towards analogy, convictions about geology, and philosophical grounding in much that the Victorian age held dear. But his mechanism of evolutionary change — the theory of natural selection — rests upon a central logic, a mode of working, that should define the basic attributes of Darwinism. The theory of natu­ral selection is functionalist, by Darwin's own recognition and definition, and by routes (and roots) of causality inherent in its proposed mechanics. In­trinsic factors supply copious, small-scale, isotropic variation — raw material only, and no direct cause or impetus of change. Evolutionary change occurs by natural selection, as organisms adapt to modify local environments. The mechanism of evolutionary change therefore remains functionalist in Dar­win's theory; selection powers change, and organisms adapt as a primary re­sult. Darwin also defined his major problem squarely within the functionalist theme of adaptation, as he wrote, in the oft-quoted statement in the Introduc­tion to the Origin (1859, p. 3), that much evidence, from many sources, could validate the factuality of evolution itself, but that “nevertheless, such a con­clusion, even if well founded, would be unsatisfactory until it could be shown how the innumerable species inhabiting this world have been modified, so as to acquire that perfection of structure and coadaptation which most justly ex­cites our admiration.” The argument from imperfection (pp. 111-116) dem­onstrates the factuality of evolution, but we need to explain adaptation if we wish to understand the mechanism.





DARWIN ON CORRELATION OF PARTS





Many evolutionists can cite the specific example given by Darwin in Chapter 6 of the Origin (“Difficulties on Theory”) in allowing that not all useful structures arise by natural selection for their current role, however essential that function may be to the life of the organism: “The sutures in the skulls of young mammals have been advanced as a beautiful adaptation for aiding par­turition, and no doubt they facilitate, or may be indispensable for this act; but as sutures occur in the skulls of young birds and reptiles, which have only to escape from a broken egg, we may infer that this structure has arisen from the laws of growth, and has been taken advantage of in the parturition of the higher animals” (1859, p. 197).

But I suspect that few of our colleagues know that Darwin took this exam­ple directly from the much longer and more detailed treatment in Richard Owen's famous essay (1849) On the Nature of Limbs (see quote from Owen on p. 325). This example not only provides direct evidence for an influence of the leading British structuralist thinker upon Darwin (a link often denied be­cause we misread Owen as a creationist, and a leader of the rearguard), but also illustrates a fascinating change of emphasis between Owen's invocation and Darwin's borrowing. For Owen, the example lies at the heart of nature's primary causal structure, and serves as a point of entry to his most trenchant critique of functionalism in general — particularly his claim that explanations of organic form in terms of utility match the barrenness of the Vestal Virgins in Bacon's famous aphorism. For Darwin, on the other hand, the example il­lustrates an exception to natural selection included within a chapter entitled “Difficulties on Theory.”

But Darwin's serious concern with structural constraint cannot be denied (and his borrowed example from Owen surely indicates respect and atten­tion). Darwin linked the efficacy of natural selection to a set of assumptions about the nature of variation (see pp. 141–146). But he could not be satisfied with such an abstraction, and he recognized that any complete theory re­quired an understanding of mechanisms of variation. Darwin presented his major discussion of constraint in Chapter 5 on “Laws of Variation” — for any exception to his trio of necessary properties for variation (copious, small in extent, and undirected) would compromise the exclusive power of natural se­lection by granting a role to “internal” principles of variation in the direction of evolutionary change. Any exception, in short, would represent a “law of variation” acting not only as a source of raw material, but also as a subsid­iary to natural selection among causes of change. (In both the Origin (1859) and in his extended treatise on The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication (1868), Darwin employed the phrase “laws of variation” to specify properties that could produce evolutionary change independent of natural selection. He proposed a threefold taxonomy of “use and disuse,” “direct action of the external environment” — the bases of evolutionary theo­ries often attributed to Lamarck and Geoffroy respectively — and “correlation of growth,” or structural constraint as discussed in this chapter. Properties of variation that merely supplied raw material for natural selection — the indis­pensable trio of copious, small, and undirected — apparently did not count among the “laws,” for Darwin viewed these properties as auxiliaries or hand­maidens of selection.)

Darwin begins his discussion by admitting contemporary ignorance about causes of variation: “I have hitherto sometimes spoken as if the variations — so common and multiform in organic beings under domestication, and in a lesser degree in those in the state of nature — had been due to chance. This, of course, is a wholly incorrect expression, but it serves to acknowledge plainly our ignorance of the cause of each particular variation” (1859, p. 131).

When we do not know the underlying causal bases of important and re­lated phenomena, taxonomies based upon overt expressions become our best practical procedure for specification and understanding. Darwin therefore tries to gather the phenomena of variation into categories. Most categories either enhance adaptation by routes other than natural selection (use and dis­use, and direct effects of the environment — Lamarckism and Geoffroyism in later parlance), or, at most, serve to enhance or slow down selection by affecting the amount of available raw material in variation. Only one cate­gory truly challenges the functionalist credo by embracing the primary struc­turalist theme of internal constraint upon adaptation, with consequential no functionality for certain features. Darwin names this category “corre­lations of growth,” and offers a definition: “I mean by this expression that the whole organization is so tied together during its growth and develop­ment, that when slight variations in any one part occur, and are accumulated through natural selection, other parts become modified. This is a very im­portant subject, most imperfectly understood” (1859, p. 143). Note, even here, how Darwin defends the primacy of selection (by the “sequelae” argument of the relative frequency tradition — see pp. 255–256). Natural selection builds a feature, and others follow by correlational linkage to this generating cause.

Darwin clearly defines correlation of growth as a category contrary to nat­ural selection, for he explicitly excludes the common case of taxonomically correlated structures that arise by separate selection on each feature, with later joint propagation by simple inheritance (wings and beaks in birds). He defines correlation of growth, on the other hand, as structurally forced asso­ciation independent of immediate selection: “We may often falsely attribute to correlation of growth, structures which are common to whole groups of species, and which in truth are simply due to inheritance; for an ancient progenitor may have acquired through natural selection some one modifica­tion in structure, and, after thousands of generations, some other and inde­pendent modification; and these two modifications, having been transmitted to a whole group of descendants with diverse habits, would necessarily be thought to be correlated in some necessary manner” (1859, p. 146).

Darwin's genuine interest in correlations of growth arose from several sources, including the mystery surrounding the subject. “The nature of the bond of correlation is very frequently quite obscure . . . What can be more singular than the relation between blue eyes and deafness in cats, and the tor­toise-shell color with the female sex?” (1859, p. 144). Again, as for the larger issue of variation in general, Darwin follows a fruitful operational strategy: when you can't specify causes, at least gather overt phenomena into reason­able categories. The short epitome of the Origin (where correlation of growth receives seven pages of discussion) lists four major categories:

1. Adaptive modifications of early ontogeny that propagate effects into later growth: “The most obvious case is, that modifications accumulated solely for the good of the young or larvae, will, it may safely be concluded, af­fect the structure of the adult; in the same manner as any malconformation affecting the early embryo, seriously affects the whole organization of the adult” (1859, p. 143).

2. Correlated variation in serially homologous and symmetrical structures of the body. (Note how Darwin, following the popular structuralist theory of the vertebral archetype, viewed correlated variation of jaws and limbs as po­tentially homologous): “The several parts of the body which are homologous, and which, at an early embryonic period, are alike, seem liable to vary in an allied manner: we see this in the right and left sides of the body varying in the same manner; in the front and hind legs, and even in the jaws and limbs, vary­ing together, for the lower jaw is believed to be homologous with the limbs” (1859, p. 143).

Although he cited the argument of ontogenetic correlation as first and most obvious, Darwin devoted more interest and attention to this second category of homologous variation. He presents (especially in the longer version of 1868 — see pp. 336–341) a variety of wide-ranging and intriguing cases (not all correct, of course). For example, in regarding teeth and hair as homolo­gous, Darwin conjectures: “I think it can hardly be accidental, that if we pick out the two orders of Mammalia which are most abnormal in their dermal covering, viz. Cetacea (whales) and Edentata (armadilloes, scaly anteaters, etc.), that these are likewise the most abnormal in their teeth” (1859, p. 144).

Nonetheless, since Darwin remains eager to assert the primacy of natural selection as the centerpiece of his worldview, he reminds us that correlation can only be subsidiary in impact — ever present to be sure, but always subject to cancellation if selection favors dissociation: “These tendencies, I do not doubt, may be mastered more or less completely by natural selection: thus a family of stags once existed with an antler only on one side; and if this had been of any great use to the breed it might probably have been rendered per­manent by natural selection” (1859, p. 143).

3. Homologous parts not only vary together, but also tend to join or fuse. “Homologous parts, as has been remarked by some authors, tend to cohere ... nothing is more common than the union of homologous parts in normal structures, as the union of the petals of the corolla into a tube” (1859, pp. 143-144).

4. One part (usually hard upon soft) may impress its form upon another: “Hard parts seem to affect the form of adjoining soft parts; it is believed by some authors that the diversity in the shape of the pelvis in birds causes the remarkable diversity in the shape of their kidneys. Others believe that the shape of the pelvis in the human mother influences by pressure the shape of the head of the child” (1859, p. 144).

Darwin considered one further category, strongly emphasized by Goethe and, later, by Geoffroy as the “Loi de balancement” or compensation: “If nourishment flows to one part or organ in excess, it rarely flows, at least in excess, to another part; thus it is difficult to get a cow to give much milk and to fatten readily. The same varieties of the cabbage do not yield abundant and nutritious foliage and a copious supply of oil-bearing seeds” (p. 147). But Darwin, while acknowledging the importance and intellectual pedigree of this principle, wisely chose to exclude compensation from his discussion of structural correlation because he could state no clear criterion (and the problem remains just as vexatious today) for separating negative interaction due to selection from forced and nonadaptive correlation due to limited re­sources: “For I hardly see any way of distinguishing between the effects, on the one hand, of a part being largely developed through natural selection and another and adjoining part being reduced by this same process or by disuse, and, on the other hand, the actual withdrawal of nutriment from one part owing to the excess of growth in another and adjoining part” (p. 147).

Although limited space and numerous hedges clearly indicate the subordi­nate status of constraint to adaptation in Darwin's evolutionary views, he evi­dently did take serious interest in correlations of growth, and he did identify the theme as contrary to, or at least independent of, natural selection — as in this statement: “I know of no case better adapted to show the importance of the laws of correlation in modifying important structures, independently of utility, and therefore, of natural selection, than that of the difference between the outer and inner flowers in some Compositous and Umbelliferous plants” (1859, p. 144). (Note Darwin's interesting linguistic choice in designating this example as so well “adapted” to illustrate constraint.)

Darwin also allowed that taxonomically important, and not just trivial, characters could be shaped by correlations of growth: “Hence we see that modifications of structure, viewed by systematists as of high value, may be wholly due to unknown laws of correlated growth, and without being, as far as we can see, of the slightest service to the species” (1859, p. 146).

Darwin, as all professional evolutionists know, had been writing a much fuller version of his evolutionary views (a book that would have been about as long as Lyell's three-volume Principles of Geology) when Wallace's note from Ternate arrived in 1858. The hurried Origin of Species (1859) is an epit­ome (of 490 pages!) without formal references. Darwin intended to complete and publish the longer version, but never realized this project. Instead, he took most of the material designated for the early part of Natural Selection (Darwin's putative title for the full treatment), expanded his coverage, and published his longest book in 1868, the two-volume Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication. (Incidentally, the fourteen-page introduc­tory chapter to volume 1 presents Darwin's clearest and most cogent gen­eral summary of his evolutionary views and methodological principles. This largely unread essay should be assigned to all students of evolution.)

Volume one provides a chapter-by-chapter treatment of various domesti­cated species (with Chapter 5 on “domestic pigeons,” unsurprisingly given Darwin's interest, as the most illuminating). This material largely represents an expansion of Chapter 1 in the Origin, “Variation under domestication.” Volume two then presents Darwin's general ideas on variation and inheri­tance (an expansion of Chapters 4 and 5 of the Origin, with much added material). Darwin actually published more about inheritance than about nat­ural selection, thus refuting the common statement that he neglected the sub­ject of heredity — a myth engendered by the retrospective fallacy, given his success with selection and his limited impact in resolving the principles of he­redity. Volume two includes sets of chapters on four subjects: inheritance, crossing, selection, and causes of variation, all capped with the chapter that would become (along with his geological error on the “parallel roads” of Glen Roy) his nemesis — Chapter 27 on “the provisional hypothesis of pan-genesis” (Darwin's Lamarckian conjecture about the nature of inheritance). Darwin included his material on structural constraint within this volume, providing an expanded version of his views in Chapters 25 and 26 on “corre­lated variability,” a term that he now regards as preferable to “the somewhat vague expression of correlation of growth” (1868, vol. 2, p. 319), used previ­ously.

However, despite extensive elaboration and addition of examples, Dar­win's treatment scarcely differs from the short version in the Origin. He pre­sents the same taxonomy for modes of “correlation of growth.” Again, early modification with propagating effects through ontogeny wins first place, al­though Darwin now adds some interesting examples: “with short-muzzled races of the dog certain histological changes in the basal elements of the bones arrest their development and shorten them, and this affects the position of the subsequently developed molar teeth” (1868, vol. 2, p. 321).

Darwin then inserts a new category, strangely overlooked in 1859 (a testi­mony, perhaps, to his subsidiary concern for the general subject of structural constraint) — allometric effects of change in size, either of the whole body, or of parts:

Another simple case of correlation is that with the increased or decreased dimensions of the whole body, or of any particular part, certain organs are increased or diminished in number, or are otherwise modified. Thus pigeon-fanciers have gone on selecting pouters for length of body, and we have seen that their vertebrae are generally increased in number, and their ribs in breadth.... In Germany it has been observed that the period of gestation is longer in large-sized than in small-sized breeds of cattle. With our highly improved animals of all kinds the period of maturity has advanced . . . and, in correspondence with this, the teeth are now devel­oped earlier than formerly, so that, to the surprise of agriculturists, the ancient rules for judging the age of an animal by the state of its teeth are no longer trustworthy (1868, vol. 2, p. 321).



As in 1859, Darwin devotes most attention to correlated variability in homologous structures. In part, this preference can claim a methodological basis, for Darwin finds less mystery in the bonding or joint variation of homologs than in most other cases of structural constraint:

In many cases of slight deviations of structure as well as of grave monstrosities, we cannot even conjecture what is the nature of the bond of connection. But between homologous parts — between the fore and hind limbs — between the hair, hooves, horns, and teeth — we can see that parts which are closely similar during their early development, and which are exposed to similar conditions, would be liable to be modified in the same manner. Homologous parts, from having the same nature, are apt to blend together, and, when many exist, to vary in number (1868, vol. 2, pp. 419-420).



Amidst a plethora of interesting examples, Darwin cites pigeons that de­velop feathers and incipient wing-like membranes on portions of the foot cor­responding to the position of wings on the forelimbs: “In feather-footed pi­geons, not only does the exterior surface support a row of long feathers, like wing feathers, but the very same digits which in the wing are completely united by skin become partially united by skin in the feet; and thus by the law of the correlated variation of homologous parts we can understand the curi­ous connection of feathered legs and membrane between the two outer toes” (1868, vol. 2, p. 323).

Citing the theory of vertebral archetypes again, Darwin tries to correlate variation in head and limb bones, while acknowledging that not all biologists accept the idea: “If those naturalists are correct who maintain that the jaw­bones are homologous with the limb bones, then we can understand why the head and limbs tend to vary together in shape and even in color; but several highly competent judges dispute the correctness of this view” (1868, vol. 2, p. 324). He also argues that joint slimness in head and limbs of greyhounds, and similar thickness of both structures in draft horses, might record struc­tural correlation between putative homologs.

Proceeding further, Darwin considers hair, feathers, hooves, horns and teeth as “homologous over the whole body” (p. 326). He argues that sheep with a tendency to grow multiple horns also have “great length and coarse­ness of fleece.” He also reports that sheep with more curly wool bear more spirally twisted horns, and that many breeds of hairless dogs grow deficient teeth.

Moving to humans, Darwin tries to relate some forms of inherited baldness to weakness of dentition, and even claims that rare cases of restored hair in old age may be accompanied by renewal of teeth. In his most intriguing ex­ample, Darwin discusses Julia Pastrana, the famous “bearded lady” of circus sideshows. Proclaiming her, with true Victorian sensibility, “a remarkably fine woman” (p. 328), Darwin continues: “... but she had a thick masculine beard and a hairy forehead; she was photographed, and her stuffed skin was exhibited as a show; but what concerns us is, that she had in both the upper and lower jaw an irregular double set of teeth, one row being placed within the other . .. From the redundancy of the teeth her mouth projected, and her face had a gorilla-like appearance” (p. 328).

Darwin even invokes putative homology — this time between organs of sight and hearing — to explain the case that he had always found personally most bothersome: deafness correlated with blue eyes in cats:

The organs of sight and hearing are generally admitted to be homolo­gous, both with each other and with the various dermal appendages; hence these parts are liable to be abnormally affected in conjunction ... Here is a more curious case: white cats if they have blue eyes, are almost always deaf . . . This case of correlation in cats has struck many persons as marvelous ... [But,] we have already seen that the organs of sight and hearing are often simultaneously affected. In the present instance, the cause probably lies in a slight arrest of development in the nervous sys­tem in connection with the sense organs. Kittens during the first nine days, whilst their eyes are closed, appear to be completely deaf; I have made a great clanging noise with a poker and shovel close to their heads, both when they were asleep and awake, without producing any effect. ... Now, as long as the eyes continue closed, the iris is no doubt blue, for in all the kittens which I have seen this color remains for some time after the eyelids open. Hence if we suppose the development of the organs of sight and hearing to be arrested at the stage of the closed eyelids, the eyes would remain permanently blue and the ears would be incapa­ble of perceiving sound; and we should thus understand this curious case (pp. 328-329).



And yet, though Darwin now presents more examples of correlated vari­ability than he had provided in 1859, the main thrust of the 1868 volumes, as we shall see in the next section, only accentuates the dominance of selection over these exceptions to its domination.





THE “QUITE SUBORDINATE POSITION” OF CONSTRAINT

TO SELECTION





Paradoxically perhaps, an absence of strong concern for a subject may be better expressed by inadequacy of treatment than by total evasion. Had Dar­win simply omitted the subject of correlated variability altogether, we would know little about his attitude toward constraint (however much we might in­fer from his indifference). But the weakness of his limited discussion reveals far more. As E. S. Russell rightly remarks (1916, p. 240): “Darwin's concep­tion of correlation was singularly incomplete. As examples of correlation he advanced such trivial cases as the relation between albinism, deafness and blue eyes in cats, or between the tortoise-shell color and the female sex. He used the word only in connection with what he called 'correlated variation.' ... He took it for granted that the 'correlated variations' would be adapted to the original variation which was acted upon by natural selection.” (I find Russell a bit harsh in this particular claim. Correlated variability may be “adapted” to the primary target of selection in the sense that organic coher­ence in growth must be maintained, for the correlation marks an inherited pathway. But Darwin clearly designates the realized feature as potentially in­dependent of utility, though admittedly not harmful, for selection would then work to eliminate it.)

Darwin's discussion of variation in the Origin clearly illustrates his convic­tion about the primacy of selection over any internal drive in supply of varia­tion or constraint. Variation (with its three key properties) must be available as raw material, but all shaping and change arise by natural selection. In those rare cases when change can be traced directly to variability itself — that is, when a phenomenon caused by variability becomes visible as a property of a population, rather than the oddity of an individual — we must seek an ex­planation in the relaxation of selection's usual vigilance and control. Rudi­mentary parts, for example, become free from selective control, and may therefore manifest the influence of subsidiary factors, including constraint, that selection would ordinarily mask: “Rudimentary parts, it has been stated by some authors, and I believe with truth, are apt to be highly variable . . . their variability seems to be owing to their uselessness, and therefore to natu­ral selection having no power to check deviations in their structure. Thus ru­dimentary parts are left to the free play of the various laws of growth, to the effects of long continued disuse, and to the tendency to reversion” (1859, pp. 149-150).

The concluding statement in Chapter 5 on “Laws of Variation” clearly expresses the domination of selection: “Whatever the cause may be of each slight difference in the offspring from their parents, and a cause for each must exist, it is the steady accumulation, through natural selection, of such differ­ences, when beneficial to the individual, that gives rise to all the more impor­tant modifications of structure, by which the innumerable beings on the face of this earth are enabled to struggle with each other, and the best adapted to survive” (1859, p. 170).

But the fuller treatment of the 1868 work — Darwin's longest book, and primarily written as a treatise on variation, not selection — asserts this funda­mental claim even more forcefully. As in the Origin, Darwin does allow (1868, vol. 2, p. 320 and p. 355, for example) that correlations of growth produce features (including taxonomically important markers) independent of utility. But the domination of selection, by arguments of relative frequency and importance, now becomes even more explicit, as in this statement from the introductory chapter: “I shall in this volume treat, as fully as my materials permit, the whole subject of variation under domestication. We may thus hope to obtain some light, little though it be, on the causes of variability.... During this investigation we shall see that the principle of Selection is all im­portant. Although man does not cause variability and cannot even prevent it, he can select, preserve, and accumulate the variations given to him by the hand of nature in any way which he chooses; and thus he can certainly pro­duce a great result” (1868, vol. 1, p. 3).

Darwin, as I argued previously, may not be a consistently brilliant writer in the tradition of Huxley or Lyell. But he did exceed his more stylish colleagues in a literary gift for inventing metaphors that capture the essence of complex ideas. Most of Darwin's enduring lines fall into this category — the face of na­ture bright with gladness, struggle for existence, survival of the fittest, wedg­ing as an image for competition. The Origin introduces strikingly appropriate and beautifully crafted metaphors in crucial places — the tree of life in the summary of natural selection at the end of Chapter 4 (pp. 129-130), and the entangled bank of the book's final flourish (p. 489).

Darwin also developed a remarkable metaphor to summarize his convic­tion about the relative importance of selection and variation. He introduced this long passage at the end of his chapter on selection in his 1868 work — the “interloper” chapter, if you will, where the dominating force surveys an en­tire volume devoted to subservients. We might label this image as the meta­phor of building stones for the house of morphology. No other passage in all Darwin's writing so strongly illustrates the domination of selection over raw material.

All components for the primacy of selection, and for the inconsequentiality of constraint (and other internal factors), flow together in this striking image: Selection may depend upon variation, but the character of variation hardly matters (so long as appropriate amounts and styles be present), given the power of selection. Variation cannot be truly random, and we should interest ourselves in its particular forms and biases (the shapes of stones used by the mason). But, in the deepest sense, these preferred forms exert no influence upon the final building when selection (the architect) takes charge. For laws of variation (shapes of stones) “bear no relation to the living structure which is slowly built up” (the form of the building). An architect, armed with a blueprint and enough stones, can build the desired structure, whatever the shapes of pieces available for construction. Thus, “variability sinks to a quite subordinate position in importance in comparison with selection.”

Throughout this chapter and elsewhere I have spoken of selection as the paramount power, yet its action absolutely depends on what we in our ignorance call spontaneous or accidental variability. Let an architect be compelled to build an edifice with uncut stones, fallen from a precipice. The shape of each fragment may be called accidental; yet the shape of each has been determined by the force of gravity, the nature of the rock, and the slope of the precipice — events and circumstances, all of which depend on natural laws; but there is no relation between these laws and the purpose for which each fragment is used by the builder. In the same manner the variations of each creature are determined by fixed and im­mutable laws; but these bear no relation to the living structure which is slowly built up through the power of selection, whether this be natural or artificial selection.

If our architect succeeded in rearing a noble edifice, using the rough wedge-shaped fragments for the arches, the longer stones for the lintels and so forth, we should admire his skill even in a higher degree than if he had used stones shaped for the purpose. So it is with selection, whether applied by man or by nature; for though variability is indispensably necessary, yet, when we look at some highly complex and excellently adapted organism, variability sinks to a quite subordinate position in im­portance in comparison with selection, in the same manner as the shape of each fragment used by our supposed architect is unimportant in com­parison with his skill (1868, vol. 2, pp. 248-249).



I suggest, as a major theme of this book, that Darwinian evolutionists, ever since, have placed too much confidence in this edifice. Darwin's metaphorical structure, fully shaped by the architect of natural selection, cannot be dis­missed as a house of cards, but the walls have developed some cracks and may even be ripe for a breach.
