Constraint As a Positive Concept





TWO KINDS OF POSITIVITY





An etymological introduction


After Job has endured, and countered with remarkable success in his straight­ened circumstance, three cycles of argument from each of his three supposed friends and comforters, a fourth participant in this moral and intellectual de­bate for the ages — the problem of theodicy, or why should the righteous suf­fer as much bodily torment and material deprivation as the unjust? — steps forward to make his pitch. Elihu, the son of Barachel the Buzite, offers an only slightly more comforting argument in admitting that Job's suffering may well be undeserved, but urging that Job view his distress as a salutary disci­pline leading to reconciliation with God (no physical relief, to be sure, but a damned sight more encouraging than the previous insistence of Zophar, Eliphaz and Bildad that Job must have sinned if God had so punished him).

Elihu states that he had hesitated to intervene previously because his youth demanded forbearance. (Modern Biblical scholars, on the other hand, regard Elihu's argument as so inconsistent with the rest of the book, in both style and content, that these late chapters probably represent a subsequent interpola­tion, thus explaining the curious fact that Elihu's name appears nowhere else in the entire book. Elihu probably “waited” his turn until the end because he didn't exist in the original story.) But he will now speak because he must. An internal force demands that he remain silent no longer: “I also will shew mine opinion. For I am full of matter; the spirit within me constraineth me. Behold my belly is as wine which hath no vent; it is ready to burst” (Job 32:17-19).

I choose this unconventional mode of beginning a scientific discussion with Biblical exegesis because this chapter (and a central theme in the logic of this entire book) rests upon a particular definition and construction of the con­cept of constraint — a meaning easily defended both terminologically and factually, but often so buried in a confusing and contentious literature that the centrality of the argument becomes lost in collegial frustration.

In short, I emphasize two major premises at the outset: (1) The concept of constraint must be sharpened and restricted in meaning to a coherent set of causal factors that can promote evolutionary change from a structuralist per­spective different from — in the helpful sense of “in addition to” or “in con­junction with, and yielding interesting nonlinear conclusions in the amalgam­ation,” rather than “in opposition to” — the functionalist logic of Darwinian natural selection. (2) The concept of constraint must include theoretically le­gitimate and factually important positive meanings — i.e., constraints as di­recting causes of particular evolutionary changes — rather than only the nega­tive connotations of structural limitations that prevent natural selection from crafting an alteration that would otherwise be favored and achieved.

The passage from Job, needless to say, only provides an etymological justification for this crucial positivity of meaning. The case for actual existence, and important relative frequency, of these positive aspects then becomes the organizing theme of this chapter. But etymology provides a good beginning, because we must first establish the coherence of a case in language and logic before we can ask, with appropriate clarity, whether nature assents to such a reasonable and testable hypothesis.

The meanings and derivations of “constraint” are varied and complex. The Latin root stringere means both to compress or to draw tight (the negative connotations), but also to move, affect or touch (the positive aspects). The prefix con, meaning “with” or “together,” brings several items into the field of change or compression. Thus, constraints can surely be negative — as when we toss a group of miscreants into a jail cell in order to keep them close and restrict their movements. But constraints can also be positive, as when we force a group of items into closer conjunction so that their combined power and speed can grow and also become more focused in a particular direction towards a definite goal — as in the increased speed of fluids in narrowed pipes, according to Bernoulli's principle.

I do not deny that modern English usage favors the negative connota­tions — hence my rationale for this introduction. But the positive meanings re­main current, and certainly sanctioned both historically and linguistically. I began with Elihu's statement because, when I first studied the Bible as a teen­ager, this passage confused me. I did not yet know the positive meaning of constraint, and therefore couldn't figure out why Elihu, although practically bursting from his need to speak, felt so constrained that he dared not do so (even though he did so in the very next verse!). Of course, Elihu meant “constraineth” in the opposite and positive sense that his need would force, or constrain, the desired result — and that his words would pour forth in a definite and channeled direction, not as a random spewing.* This active sense of “constraint” as promoting change in particular directions marks the posi­tive meaning that motivates this chapter and raises an important issue for Darwinian theory in providing a best general case and opportunity for posi­tive interaction with the functionalist precepts of natural selection.





The first (empirical) positive meaning of channeling


Orthodox Darwinian functionalists have often reacted by arguing “why the big fuss, we know (and both admit and use) the concept of constraint al­ready” to evolutionists of a structuralist bent who claim that a properly for­mulated version of “constraint” should evoke great interest and provoke substantial reform. I would accept this jaded reaction if the version of “con­straint” proffered by structuralist critics stayed within the negative meanings described above. But positive meanings of constraint — and I will outline two different constructions of positivity in this section — can lead to important ex­tensions of evolutionary theory by questioning and reformulating what I have called the second branch, or the second tripod leg, of Darwinism's essential triad of indispensable arguments: the functionalist attribution of effectively all substantial evolutionary change to natural selection.

I agree that negative constructions of constraint do not seriously chal­lenge this major precept (while supplying some interesting subtleties and wrinkles that orthodox functionalists can use and appreciate) for the fol­lowing set of interconnected reasons: Mainline Darwinism is a functionalist theory of “trial-and-error externalism” (in R. C. Lewontin's phrase). The organism “proposes” by generating variation, ultimately by mutation (and subsequently by distribution in sexual recombination for organisms tradi­tionally deemed “higher”), among members of populations. This variation acts as raw material — the “chance” in Monod's famous metaphor of “chance and necessity”; the “error” in Lewontin's “trial-and-error” — for a causal pro­cess of natural selection (the “necessity” in Monod's pairing; the “trial” of Lewontin's joining). That is, the organism proposes, and the environment (in­teracting with the organism) disposes.

The organism's generation of variation provides the internal component of evolution; the environment's process of selection marks the external contri­bution. These internal and external factors play strikingly different roles in Darwinian theory — a contrast well epitomized (as noted above) in Monod's phrase “chance and necessity.” The internal component can only supply raw material and does not establish the rates or vectors of change. This claim — that variation provides potential, but not direction — sets a fundamental pos­tulate of Darwinian mechanics and philosophy. Natural selection, the exter­nal component, carries full responsibility for the direction — and also, ulti­mately, for the modes and rates — of evolutionary change.

As discussed at length in Chapter 2, Darwin's central insight that variation must be “isotropic” — particularly, that it be copious in amount, small in ex­tent, and undirected towards adaptive configurations — underlies his brilliant grasp of what selection requires from variation to permit a functionalist the­ory to operate in principle, and also to dominate the causes of evolutionary change. If variation is truly isotropic in Darwin's hypothesized sense, then selection gains free rein (and reign) as the cause of change — in sharp contrast to nearly all competing 19th century evolutionary theories, with their stress on internally generated directionality.

To epitomize the theoretical importance of constraint in a single sentence, the concept of non-isotropy in variation may be roughly synonymized with notions of “constraint” — that is, with claims that internal factors restrict the freedom of natural selection to establish and control the direction of evolu­tionary change.

The crucial importance of constraint in evolutionary theory therefore cen­ters upon this potential challenge, particularly upon the nature and scope of the restrictions. In Chapters 4 and 5 — the longest section of this book's first half, because the subject consistently commanded the principal attention of Darwin's most cogent critics — I considered both pre and post-Darwinian the­ories of evolutionary internalism, as rooted in the common claim that any sig­nificant non-isotropy of variation would reduce, or even cancel, the creative role of natural selection by identifying potent internal forces of evolutionary change in either directed or saltatory variation. These two persistent bug­bears of “quick” and “channeled” received their most memorable (and influ­ential) joint expression in the challenging metaphor of Galton's polyhedron (see pages 342–351 of Chapter 5).

Of course, no sophisticated Darwinian ever denied some limited domain of validity to the concept of internally generated “constraints.” (As I have em­phasized throughout this book, validation in natural history rarely follows the criterion of “never in principle for this would violate nature's laws,” as favored in some constructions of the so-called exact sciences, but rather the standard of “conceivable in principle, but not occurring often enough to matter,” as followed in historical sciences that formulate most basic judg­ments by analysis of relative frequencies.) Rather, Darwinian functionalists have tended to admit certain kinds of constraints, and have then tried to limit their modes of occurrence and domains of action in such a manner that the central principle of Darwinian theory — the control of evolutionary change by natural selection — will not be threatened.

In short, and to summarize these few pages of argument in a paragraph, orthodox Darwinians have not balked at negative constructions of constraint as limits and impediments to the power of natural selection in certain definable situations. But they have been far less willing to embrace positive meanings of constraint as promoters, suppliers, and causes of evolutionary direction and change. This distinction follows logically from the basic premises of Darwin­ian functionalism, because the admission of a potent and positive version of constraint would compromise the fundamental principle that variation (the structuralist and internalist component of evolution) only proposes, while se­lection (the functionalist and externalist force) disposes as the only effective cause of change.

In considering how structural constraints might limit the power of natu­ral selection to adapt each feature of an organism to each local environ­ment, we recognize that some modes will rank as “benign” for Darwinian functionalists; others as less benign but not subversive to orthodox theory; whereas still others — particularly the positive modes that promote, and do not just limit, evolutionary change — do pose a deeper theoretical challenge, and have therefore set the major battleground of a subject that has, of late, become both highly confusing and maximally contentious in the literature of evolutionary biology (Gould, 1980c; Alberch, 1982; Maynard Smith et al., 1985; Stearns, 1986; Antonovics and van Tienderen, 1991; Schwenk, 1995; Duboule and Wilkins, 1998; Eble, 1999).

The most benign category does not restrict the organism's potential for reaching a best-adapted overall phenotype for a particular environmental background — and therefore only counts as “constraint” with respect to un­realizable and idealized abstractions. To cite two examples, so called “trade offs” preclude separate optimization of each part because natural selection works upon the entire organism as a totality. The best-adapted whole cannot evolve as a simple summation of separately optimized parts because, in an in­tegrated structure that must function as a single coherent entity, the “perfec­tion” of some parts can only be achieved at the expense of others. Therefore, to cite an old conjecture for illustrating the obvious, the optimal size for a hu­man brain at birth may be too big to allow the passage of a neonate through the birth canal. But such structural constraints, imposed by a selected whole upon individual parts not subject to independent optimization in any case, do not challenge, but rather affirm, the central Darwinian postulate that selec­tion works on organisms.

Secondly, mechanical limits (also structural or formal in character) obvi­ously preclude certain solutions that might offer abstract advantages in adap­tation. Zebras could avoid feline predators by flying away, but even if genetic variation existed (as it almost surely does not!) for constructing a supernu­merary pair of limbs in wing like form, zebras clearly exceed permissible weight limits under the venerable Galilean principle of declining surface to volume ratios in large creatures.

I cite both these examples tongue-in-cheek because no one would view such obvious, and evidently “benign,” classes of structural constraint as chal­lenges to Darwinian adaptationism (or even as particularly interesting in any intellectual sense). Darwinian functionalism works by local adaptation of in­tegral organisms to immediate environments. Neither biomechanical optimi­zation part by part (prevented by “trade-offs” or integral constraints), nor putatively advantageous configurations outside the limits of mechanical pos­sibility (physical or formal constraints), poses any challenge to the tenets of Darwinian functionalism.

In a less benign, theoretically relevant (although ultimately not debilitat­ing), and widely discussed category, limitations based upon absence of suf­ficient variability to provide raw material for natural selection (and usually called genetic or developmental constraints) do operate widely in nature. (Since natural selection “makes nothing” by itself, but can only operate upon raw material supplied by an independent process of variation — a statement familiar enough to rank as a “mantra” among Darwinian evolutionists — a shortage of building stones can slow, or even derail, the construction of a well designed house.)

In the “consensus paper” of Maynard Smith and eight prominent col­leagues associated with a wide range of views from Darwinian orthodoxy (Lande and Maynard Smith himself) to serious structuralist heterodoxy (Raup, Goodwin and Kauffman), “limitations on phenotypic variability” (1985, p. 269) became the nucleating point of agreement in their remarkable exercise in intellectual diplomacy. Therefore, “developmental constraint” in this sense of limitation in necessary raw material to fuel the workings of natu­ral selection, has become (in a minimalist interpretation that I do not chal­lenge) the canonical “base-line” or “common ground” definition for this im­portant structural component in Darwinian theory. (In fairness, Maynard Smith et al., do acknowledge positive meanings of constraint as both legitimate and more interesting (see p. 1037), while advocating this “negative” definition as a minimal standard that all evolutionists can embrace, and that no Darwinian need regard as dangerously debilitating.)

Thus, to return to my previous and facetious example, zebra wings would not work for the reason cited above, but natural selection will presumably never encounter an opportunity even to attempt their construction because sufficient variability for a supernumerary pair of limbs presumably does not exist in the genetic and developmental systems of tetrapods. In a more mean­ingful category — representing a frustrating and unresolved issue that has per­meated Darwinian discussion ever since the eponym himself — the limited range of realized phenotypes in some clades (with domestic breeds of cats vs. dogs as the classic example) may reflect a structural limit in variation, rather than a lack of selective opportunity or advantage.

An important functionalist principle of natural selection, frequently (and quite explicitly) emphasized by Darwin, holds that we may, in operational terms as the “null hypothesis” of our initial assumptions for empirical test­ing, treat populations as though they always possess sufficient variation to permit natural selection an unimpeded range of action. As a practical expres­sion of this basic Darwinian belief, rates of evolutionary change fall under the control of natural selection, not of limitations (or superfluities) in raw mate­rial. Clades that either change slowly, or fail to generate many species, should be regarded as subject to little selective pressure, not as limited by intra-populational variation. If cats have developed far fewer varieties than dogs, then the differential selective efforts of human breeders, rather than any dis­parity in the ranges of available raw material, should explain the striking dif­ference.* Darwin wrote to Lyell in 1862 (quoted in F. Darwin, 1903, vol. 2, p. 338 — see pp. 330–341 for further discussion, and especially p. 341 for Darwin's comprehensive architectural metaphor for dismissing constraint as a theoreti­cal challenge to natural selection):

Mere variability, though the necessary foundation of all modifications, I believe to be almost always present, enough to allow of any amount of selected change; so that it does not seem to me at all incompatible that a group which at any one period (or during all successive periods) varies less, should in the long course of time have undergone more modification than a group which is generally more variable.

Placental animals, e.g. might be at each period less variable than Marsupials, and nevertheless have undergone more differentiation and development than marsupials, owing to some advantage, probably brain development.



I label this negative category of constraint based on lack of sufficient vari­ability as “less benign” because its operation does place a genuine damper, both actual and theoretical, upon the exclusivity of natural selection as the cause of evolutionary change. Darwin himself certainly read the issue in this light, as the above quotation indicates — for if his argument fails, and con­straint often trumps selection as a regulator of evolutionary rate, then his re­sulting disappointment, in needing to recalibrate and downgrade the relative importance of natural selection, will evidently be severe.

But this far even the most devoted selectionist must proceed — for the logic of this “less benign” category cannot be gainsaid. The basic formulation of the theory of natural selection does require structural input of raw material by variation to fuel the functional outcome of evolutionary change by selec­tion. (And since natural selection cannot, in principle, manufacture this nec­essary fuel for its own operation, lack of input can stymie output — just as the niftiest motor car can't move if you run out of gas in the middle of the Sahara, hopelessly far from the nearest petrol station in Timbuctu.) Therefore, one cannot brand limitation in raw material as an incoherent concept, or even an empirical rarity, a priori.

And yet, if selectionists can hold the line — as they generally attempt to do — at this negative definition of constraint, their theory, while deniably im­pacted, suffers no serious setback to its truly essential postulate that natural selection controls the direction of evolutionary change. At most, the nega­tive forces of constraint may slow down, or even prevent, modifications. But so long as these structural factors do not operate in a positive sense — either to determine important variation in rates and extents of change or, more threateningly, to impact or set the actual direction of change — then the fun­damental Darwinian rule still prevails: variation proposes, but only natural selection can dispose. Internal forces supply the possibilities; but natural se­lection builds the pattern (because the possibilities nearly always exist in suf­ficient abundance to fuel the changes that natural selection might favor). Constraints impede, but do not direct.

Thus, a standard Darwinian “truce” accepts the notion, even the poten­tial importance, of constraint as a negative force that can impede rates and amounts of change (and therefore cannot be dismissed as irrelevant to the generation of evolutionary pattern in this limited sense). But strict Darwinian functionalists generally try to hold the line by denying importance, or even le­gitimacy, to positive definitions of constraint as causes of directionality in evolutionary change.

In one of the best examples I have ever encountered of the vital (almost morally enjoined) principle that the forebears of our current struggles de­mand our continuing study and respect — and that we often gain, as recom­pense for this fealty, substantial practical benefit in getting our own thoughts straight, and channeled in useful directions — the rich history of debate about Darwinian theory has brought the theme of positive constraints into sharp fo­cus (see Chapters 4–5). This clarity emerges from the common emphasis placed by all major structuralist critics upon (1) the difference between posi­tive and negative meanings of constraint (accompanied by specifications that only the positive meanings could pose serious difficulties for Darwinism), and (2) the parsing of positivity into two essential themes of speed, or enhance­ment of rates beyond the power of natural selection to instigate, and channel­ing, or the preferential (perhaps even requisite) flow of change in particular directions set by internal possibilities, even if natural selection must supply an initial impetus. We should also note the ironic sense in which this argument inverts the canonical roles of the two central components in Darwinian the­ory. In natural selection, an internal source of variation provides the impetus, whereas selection determines direction. In channeled change by constraint, natural selection supplies the impetus by “getting the ball rolling” (to use Galton's metaphor of the pool table), but the directionality of evolutionary change, or “where the ball rolls,” emerges from internal channels that, so to speak, “use” natural selection as their convenient source of power. In short, variation as raw material and selection as the shaper of change in Darwinism; vs. selection as raw power, and channeled variation for shaping in theories of positive constraint. Such an epitome, needless to say, remains far too simple to resolve nature's ways — but this formulation does embody a clear and use­ful conceptual dichotomy for clarifying our thoughts.





The second (definitional) positive meaning of causes outside accepted mechanisms


A second, and conceptually quite distinct, sense of positivity for the concept of constraint also arises from a vernacular meaning of the word, but embod­ies a philosophical position about the general nature of theories and argu­ments in science, rather than a specific empirical claim about the nature of evolution.

Consider ordinary linguistic usage for the following scenario: a favored or orthodox theory undergirds the basic research program of a discipline — the usual situation that Kuhn (1962) calls “normal science” as practiced under the influence of a reigning paradigm. All scientists know, of course, that rare episodes of transition between explanatory systems, often occurring with sufficient speed and upset — both structural (to theories) and emotional (to practitioners) — to be deemed revolutionary, mark our most interesting times. Moreover, nearly all scientists, if not utterly devoid of ambition or intellectual verve, regard the development of a new explanatory system as the highest form of achievement in their profession. Nonetheless, the full working ca­reers of most scientists proceed in the usual mode of research within a basic paradigm — a “good life” full of interest and intellectual excitement, as any rich paradigm features forests of unsolved puzzles, and byways (or even sub­stantial roads) of expansion and originality.

Within such a ruling theory, a set of accepted causes and mechanisms oper­ates to yield a range of outcomes specified as permissible. (When too many in­explicable results become well documented outside this permissible range, ruling theories become strained, and an interesting time of theoretical transi­tion may soon be at hand.) Now, as a purely linguistic point, what should we call a set of anomalous results that would not have occurred if our reigning theory held the dominant or exclusive sway usually granted to its precepts? What, for example, would we say about our inability to turn mercury into gold if our causal theory proclaimed the possibility of so doing, or (to choose a case of expansion rather than restriction) what would we call our newfound ability to generate living insects from decaying flesh if our theory dictated that only plants, but not animals, could originate by spontaneous generation?

We might, of course, eventually abandon our old theory for a novel system of explanation. But what if we do not choose to do so, at least not yet, and es­pecially if we know that our theory really does work well, and as specified, for a large range of well documented cases? We would have to acknowledge that the old theory does not enjoy so wide or exclusive a domain of appli­cation as we had previously asserted. What would we then call the classes of exceptions — particularly the results of unorthodox causes that forced us to accept limitations upon the old beliefs? We generally label such exceptions as “constraints” because they restrict the range and power of our orthodox explanations.

I regard this conceptual meaning of constraint — the imposition of limits upon the range of orthodox theories by documentation of exceptions and demonstration of unorthodox causes — as undeniably “positive” in the im­portant intellectual and psychological sense that any scientist worth his salt must cherish such upsetting discoveries for the conceptual challenges thus un­leashed. Thus, if the Darwinian functionalism of natural selection acts as a reigning theory, then any documented constraint from internal channeling of variation — whether positive or negative in the empirical sense discussed in the last section — must be viewed as intellectually positive for questioning our orthodoxy and documenting something new and interesting that shouldn't have happened under our usual views. Thus, this second, conceptually posi­tive meaning of “constraint” embodies a relative concept that might be feared by those who enjoy the comforts of power, but should provoke the delight of all scientists.

To cite two recent examples of this relative meaning from recent evolution­ary literature, Weiss (1990) wrote an iconoclastic paper arguing that geomet­ric laws of serial repetition, combined with limited structural paths of alter­ation, dominate directions of phyletic change. (By the way, I disagree with his conclusion and am only discussing his terminology.) In this context, the usual orthodoxy of ordinary natural selection, working towards optimality in local adaptation, will be judged in an opposite manner as an annoying trifle that might falsify the grand pattern and temporarily hide its effects — in other words, as a constraint upon the regularity of geometrically predictable trans­formation. Weiss (1990, p. 21) acknowledged that natural selection occurs, but he dismissed the process as local distortion: “The pervasiveness of metameric 'duplication with variation' shows that it is a central principle of evolu­tion . . . Despite . . . the pattern-distorting effects of selection and drift, this evolutionary strategy is essentially unidirectional.”

Weiss's taxonomy of concepts, so peculiar to those of us with Darwinian training, makes sense in his system. We would never think uniting selection and drift into the same category, for we view them as opposite processes with respect to our primary interest in adaptation. But, within a theory of predict­able linear change enjoined by geometric principles, both drift and selection operate as local oddities that distort a broader and fundamental pattern. In any case, when we note how selection becomes a constraint upon a struc­turalist theory of geometrically rule-bound transformation, we can under­stand more easily why internal channels of preferred variation would be labeled as constraints upon a theory that ascribes all evolutionary direction to natural selection. (When a rebel labels one's own central belief as a limiting constraint, the generality of the usage becomes startlingly clear!)

In another example, Jackson and Cheetham (1999) cite punctuated equi­librium as constraining because phylogenetic patterns generated by this the­ory preclude several classes of results predicted by orthodox selectionist mod­els of gradualistic anagenesis in populations. They write (1999, p. 72): “The realities of punctuation and stasis need to be better incorporated into evo­lutionary studies. Punctuated speciation does not contradict conventional neodarwinian mechanisms, but it does constrain the range of probable evo­lutionary scenarios for speciation, evolution of life histories and macro-evolutionary trends.” “Macroevolutionary trends,” they add in explanation (p. 76), “must arise through differential rates of origination and extinction, and not by adaptive evolution within single species.”

Several participants in debates about the evolutionary meaning of con­straint (see Gould, 1989a) have explicitly embraced this relative definition. Stearns (1986), for example, properly rejected a usage so overly broad that the term would then lose all meaning — namely, the designation of all cause as “constraint” because any active force must direct change in one way rather than down other conceivable paths. “The meaning of the word would [then] vanish,” Stearns notes (1986, p. 35). He therefore recommends: “We can pre­serve it in a relative sense if we recognize that it only has meaning in a local context where one concentrates on the possibilities latent in certain processes and views the limitations on those possibilities as arising from outside that context.” Therefore, in considering revisions and expansions of Darwinian theory, ordinary natural selection becomes the context and any force (like in­ternally channeled variation) limiting its exclusive sway in directing evolu­tionary change, becomes a constraint.

Antonovics and van Tienderen (1991), in an influential article that cleared away much of the accumulating nonsense in definitional debates about con­straint in evolution, also favored this relative concept as a solution. They agreed with my argument (Gould, 1989a) that “it is those factors that influ­ence the process but are external to the favored theory that should be termed constraints” (Antonovics and van Tienderen, 1991, p. 167). But, choosing a terminology that struck them as more consistent with the ethos of scientific neutrality, they preferred the term “null model” to my “favored theory.” (I would reply that we do not usually refer to strong theories — like natural se­lection — based on particular and well-articulated causes, as “null models.” I would also argue that nothing negative attends the admission that disciplines operate under favored theories — a “good thing” for science, so long as we re­tain flexibility for change and do not equate “favored” with “established”; and, especially, so long as we treat the status of “favored” as an impetus for challenge rather than passive acquiescence, as we manifestly do when we in­voke constraints to rebut overly strict versions of natural selection.)

In any case, Antonovics and van Tienderen survey the literature and find, in support of the argument developed here, that “the overall null model used by most authors was one of evolution by natural selection (irrespective of the level of selection)” (p. 167), and that nearly all explicit claims for “con­straints” upon change within populations and lineages “dealt with evolution­ary constraints to adaptation by natural selection” (p. 166). They also noted the “odd” feature of relative definitions that strikes many scientists as para­doxical, but would not be so regarded if we accepted the honorable and inevi­table principle, so familiar to philosophers of science and language, but still faced with discomfort by many scientific professionals, that all terminology must be “theory bound” — specifically, in this case, that orthodox results of one theory become constraints in other theories. They write (p. 167): “Given evolution by random drift as a null model, natural selection now becomes a constraint!” Yes, and appropriately so — with no exclamation point needed to register surprise.

Although I disagree with his particular recommendation, Eble (1999) pub­lished a thoughtful and conceptually innovative paper rooted in this impor­tant principle of the inevitability and appropriateness of theory-bound termi­nology. Eble notes, and brilliantly analyzes, two entirely distinct, but all too frequently conflated, meanings of “chance” and “randomness” in evolution­ary theory. His article, entitled “On the dual nature of chance in evolutionary biology and paleontology,” distinguishes the conventional statistical meaning from a particular and distinctive sense frequently employed in Darwinian lit­erature — namely, “chance” defined as events occurring for reasons unrelated to the canonical mechanism of natural selection. Eble writes (1999, p. 77): “The gist of the evolutionary notion of chance is that events are independent of an organism's need and of the direction provided by natural selection in the process of adaptation.”

Eble discusses examples ranging widely across all scales of evolution, but we all know (and we all make excuses for the resulting confusion in our lec­tures to elementary courses) the most troubling and common case — the claim that mutational variation in populations, the fuel of natural selection, is “ran­dom. “ Of course, we know perfectly well that such usage does not invoke the usual mathematical concept of randomness, and that we only mean “unre­lated to the direction of natural selection” — a point emphasized in Chapter 2 in my discussion of Darwin's need for isotropy in variation (see pp. 144–146). Eble (1999, p. 78) cites the acknowledgment of many biologists, and the analyses of such leading philosophers as Popper and Sober, of this almost “studied” confusion, including a quotation of my own statement (Gould, 1982b, p. 386): “By 'random' in this context, evolutionists mean only that variation is not inherently directed towards adaptation, not that all muta­tional changes are equally likely.”

(Eble recommends that we retain the words “chance” and “random” for both meanings, and then enforce the separation with the restricting adjectives “statistical” vs. “evolutionary” chance. He argues (p. 75) that “evolutionary studies . . . can benefit from the simultaneous application of statistical and evolutionary notions of chance” — defining the second concept as “indepen­dence from adaptation and the directionality imposed by natural selection,” a definition as clearly and explicitly “theory-bound” as any I have ever read. I agree entirely with Eble's analysis. I dissent only from his terminological deci­sion to retain the word “chance” for both concepts, and to rely upon moder­ating adjectives to enforce the distinction. I would prefer the codification of a different name for the evolutionary meaning both because I don't trust the power of subsidiary adjectives to clarify the vital distinction, and because the statistical meaning represents such an important concept, in both science and practical human life, that exclusivity of usage might aid our uphill battle to educate people about the basic meaning of probability. But my terminological disagreement with Eble does not detract from my admiration for his clear characterization of the distinction, and his rich discussion of the largely un­recognized confusions thus generated.)

In any case, Eble's characterization of evolutionary “chance,” and his documentation of such extensive usage in a sense so contrary to the basic mathe­matical meaning of a fundamental term in science, only underscores the enor­mous range and influence of natural selection as our canonical theory. If organismal selection, and its key consequence of adaptation, have become so prototypical in defining how evolution works, and what evolution does, that we usually designate any other result as a “chance” phenomenon — even though the outcome may have been generated in a deterministic manner by a process that would be called “causal” in any standard scientific usage — then we achieve a better understanding of how subtle, and how extensive, the clutches of convention can become, even among people committed to innova­tion and the value of novelty.

When language unconsciously promotes orthodox mechanisms, setting barriers against our examination of alternative modes of causality, then we should vigorously analyze our terminological usages to seek a clarity that might open new possibilities. When we understand the relative meaning of constraint as a theory-bound term, expressing the orthodoxy of selection and designating all other causes of change as limitations upon an expectation* — and when we come to view this relative sense of “constraint” as a positive definition that urges us to explore alternatives to standard explanations — then we can stand a terminological bias on its head, for potential use against the same conceptual lock that engendered such a peculiar terminology in the first place.





HETEROCHRONY AND ALLOMETRY AS THE LOCUS CLASSICUS

OF THE FIRST POSITIVE (EMPIRICAL) MEANING: CHANNELED DIRECTIONALITY BY CONSTRAINT





I advocate nothing original in asking evolutionists to focus upon the empiri­cally positive concept of constraint as channels for change, rather than (as in the negative meaning) limits to natural selection imposed by insufficient raw material in variation. The “consensus paper” of Maynard Smith et al. (1985), while stressing a minimalist definition of absent variability for change in cer­tain directions (as a strategy for achieving a “least common denominator” of agreement among authors of very disparate opinions), emphasized both the legitimacy and greater interest of the positive meaning: “Does development merely prevent evolution from following particular paths or does it also serve as a directing force, accounting in part for oriented features of various trends and patterns?” (Maynard Smith et al., 1985, p. 281). Alberch (1982, p. 313) also accentuated the positive by stressing the two great themes — saltations and channels, or speed and directionality — that have always anchored the formalist or structuralist critique of Darwinian functionalism (see Chapters 4–5): “Development does not only define the apportionment of phenotypic variation upon which selection operates, but it can result in discontinuities and directionality in morphological transformations.” For further discus­sion of the positive meaning of constraint, see Riedl (1978), Gould (1980c, 1989a), and Wagner (1988). Note also that both statements, cited just above, define the positive meaning in explicit contrast with the more usual negative reading, while emphasizing the far greater evolutionary interest of the posi­tive sense.

The familiar and conceptually conjoined realms of allometry and heterochrony define a locus classicus for positive constraints in providing a sensible link between the two central themes of speed (for ease) and channeling (for direction). If we wish to argue that biased channels of internally-set variation can aid natural selection or any other functional theme in evolution, where could we find a better example than ontogeny itself, especially when the course of life features substantial allometry across a broad range of size, and often of environment as well (especially for organisms with distinct phases of larva and adult, for example). After all, this fundamental channel already generates a series of well-adapted stages each time an organism grows to ma­turity, for all parts of the life cycle must “work” in the Darwinian world of environmental interaction, or else the organism would not exist. (See Chap­ter 5 for my historical discussion of orthogenesis, as advocated by Eimer, Hyatt, and Whitman, for longstanding recognition of ontogenetic allometry as the primary source of positively channeled constraints.)

If any of these phenotypes would benefit the organism at a different size or stage of life, or if any different combination of characters (reachable by retuning the rates of development among relevant features), might yield increased adaptation, then the existing channel of ordinary ontogeny already holds the raw material in a particularly effective state for evolutionary change. And the more pronounced the allometry, the greater the potential extent of such real­izable change.

If allometric ontogenies establish channels of positive constraint, then heterochrony supplies a convenient and effective mechanism for evolutionary utilization. By selective acceleration or retardation of single traits, small to large complexes of correlated characters, or even entire phenotypic stages, heterochrony can differentially extend or compress features across onto­genetic trajectories, and can also “mix and match” the characteristics of sev­eral stages into a transformed phenotype. (Contrary to a popular impression, for example, the evolutionary power of progenesis does not lie in full “pro­motion” of a functioning larva to sexual maturity, but rather in the almost in­variable, and sometimes adventitiously beneficial, combination of characters that progenesis yields — with some features “left behind” in the early onto­genetic stages appropriate to the truncated age of sexual maturation, and oth­ers accelerated to appear in a phenotypically more adult form through cor­relation with the early achievement of sexual maturity — see Gould, 1977b.)

For these reasons, heterochrony has long been a favored concept among evolutionists searching for mechanisms to accelerate evolutionary rates in complexes of characters — for simple changes in “rate genes” (to use Gold­schmidt's old phrase) may yield extensive consequences for entire organismal phenotypes, as suites of correlated characters change in concert with altered rates of development. Thus, with strongly allometric ontogenies as favored channels, and with heterochrony available as a mechanism to move sets of characters quickly along these channels, organisms often meet both classical criteria — channeling and speed — for utilizing constraint as a positive acceler­ator of evolutionary change.

For these and other reasons, the subject of heterochrony has generated a long, memorable and voluminous literature (see De Beer, 1930 for the clas­sic 20th century statement; Gould, 1977b, for a historical and then-current summary; and McKinney, 1988, McKinney and McNamara, 1991, and McNamara, 1997, for subsequent views). In a later summary, McKinney (1999) notes that three major themes have marked the fruitful use of het­erochrony within macroevolutionary studies in recent years: heterochronoclines (or trends caused by temporal displacements of developmental rates), heterochronic biases within clades, and the origin of novelties.

In summarizing the extensive literature on heterochronoclines, McKinney emphasizes the same point stressed here — heterochrony and allometry as convenient and available mechanisms, whereby selection can accelerate and intensify adaptive change (making positive constraint a “partner,” not an “antagonist,” of selection in many cases). He writes (1999, p. 150): “Hetero­chronic variation is a very rapid, easy way to produce coadapted suites of traits. It makes sense that simple extrapolations (or truncations) of major en­vironmental parameters (such as water depth, sediment size and temperature) could select for relatively simple extrapolations (or truncations) along the ontogenetic trajectory of a population (= cladogenesis) or species (= anagenesis).”

The frequency of neoteny in salamanders, potentiated by unusual ease in dissociation of sexual maturation from somatic development, represents the classic case of heterochronic biases. In another sensible correlation of positive constraints in heterochrony with adaptive utility, Whiteman (1994) demon­strates that amphibian paedomorphs generally arise when the aquatic habitat of larvae becomes more productive, or more stable, than the terrestrial envi­ronment of adults. At a larger scale, and in an intriguing macroevolutionary speculation, McNamara (1997) surveys the known examples of heterochrony among trilobites, and finds that paedomorphosis predominates in Cambrian lineages, while the opposite processes of peramorphosis seems to gain the higher relative frequency in later Paleozoic lines. McNamara wonders if this pattern might not reflect changes in the organization and activity of homeotic genes in times of evolutionary turmoil in and after the Cambrian explosion vs. the relative “calm” of the later Paleozoic evolutionary world.

For the third theme of evolutionary novelties, the classic literature has stressed the role of global paedomorphosis, usually in the progenetic mode (as noted in Gould, 1977b), in shedding the “excess baggage” of adult com­plexity and reverting to the more labile phenotypes that often characterize ju­venile forms — an “escape from specialization” in the classic description. Such examples of “wiping the slate clean” may explain the origin of some major groups (see Mooi, 1990, on sand dollars among echinoids), but McKinney (1999) rightly points out that an even more powerful, and almost surely more frequent, heterochronic boost to the origin of novelties may lie in the poten­tial for what I previously called the “mix and match” of characters produced by varying modes of heterochrony in different features and complexes within the same organism.

As a poor and parochial surrogate for adequate review of an immense liter­ature, I limit myself to two examples from my own research that have enlight­ened me about the evolutionary implications of positive constraint in this allometric and heterochronic form.





The two structural themes of internally set channels and ease of

transformation as potentially synergistic with functional causality

by natural selection: increasing shell stability in the Gryphaea

heterochronocline


In quantitative studies of fossil invertebrates, no case has commanded nearly so much attention as the evolution of coiled Jurassic oysters of the genus Gryphaea in the British Isles (see Trueman, 1922 for the classic statement). I collected only the major papers of this debate into a full book (Gould, 1980f), while a volume of equal extent has been published since then, leading to what I regard, with obvious self-serving bias, as a genuine solution in Jones and Gould (1999). I will not discuss earlier errors and struggles (see Gould, 1972, for a compendium), and will simply note a consensus reached by the 1970's — that the complete lower Jurassic sequence from Gryphaea incurva to Gry­phaea gigantea features a basic trend in a set of phyletically correlated char­acters, including substantial increase in body size, decrease in coiling, and increasing relative width of the valves.

These trends, at least in a descriptive sense, certainly seem to embody the heterochronic result of paedomorphosis, as all sustained changes in form led to progressive juvenilization in adult phenotypes of later phylogenetic stages (Fig. 10-1). The strong allometry of increased coiling through ontogeny per­mits an easy identification of this trend, as larval shells cement briefly to a hard object, with the young organism then breaking free and coiling through­out life on a muddy substrate. Juvenile lower valves (after breaking their ini­tial cementation) therefore begin growth as relatively flat, and then coil pro­gressively throughout life. The phyletic trend to flattening strongly resembles a progressive excursion to earlier and less coiled stages of ontogeny.

But this descriptive consensus remained stymied by a common technical problem in heterochronic studies within paleontology. The causal distinctions within heterochrony can only be specified with reference to the chronological age of specimens, and few fossils record the months and years of their growth in a recoverable manner (see discussion of this dilemma in McKinney and McNamara, 1991; and Jones and Gould, 1999). Without information about the age of specimens, we could not tell whether increasing body size simply represented a chronological extension of the life cycle (with juvenilization of form then unresolvable in mode of origin), or an increase in rates of growth over an unchanged length of life (with the paedomorphic result then attribut­able to the heterochronic process of neoteny based on prolongation of rapid juvenile growth rates and attendant retention of characteristic morphologies associated with these rates).

I had the privilege of working with Douglas Jones, who developed the first reliable procedures for inferring ages from growth banding (by match­ing isotopic cycles, interpreted as seasonal, with morphological banding, Fig. 10-2 — because simple counts of banding, the standard procedure of past sclerochronological study, had never yielded firm results). We were able to break this conceptual logjam by determining the ages of shells throughout the trend (Jones and Gould, 1999), and resolving the problem, thanks to unusual cooperation from nature (who rarely provides clear answers at one extreme of a potential continuum). The larger adult shells of later phylogenetic stages showed no increase at all in length of life, but died at the same age as adult shells in the earliest stages in the trend (Fig. 10-3). Thus, we could identify the correlated phenotypic trend in size and shape as a genuine case of neoteny

When we combine this structural analysis of the evolutionary trend with a well-documented scenario for its adaptive basis, the positive aspect of con­straint as an adjunct to selection stands forth in an unusually clear manner. The environmental correlation of flat and cemented Ostrea with clear waters and hard substrates, and of coiled and free-living Gryphaea with muddy substrates,

establishes a long-enduring, iteratively-evolved pattern demanding functional explanation. The adaptive value of coiling in Gryphaea has long been ascribed with much evidence in support (see Hallam, 1968, p. 119) and little dissent among experts, to the animal's need to keep the shell commisure above the muddy substrate, lest the shell become entombed or clogged, lead­ing to the animal's death.

Coiling represents an excellent morphological means — presumably the best available given the limitations of bivalved molluscan design — for continually raising the commisure above the substrate as the shell grows. But coiling, par­ticularly if intensified in a relatively narrow shell, also entails the negative consequence of increasing instability, for a narrow object, shaped like the rocker of a hobby horse, can easily be tipped over from its presumed upright life position (see Fig. 10-5, with the plane of bilateral symmetry orthogonal to the substrate). In fact, in highly coiled Gryphaea, a shell tipped over onto its side (Fig. 10-6) lies in a position of greater stability than a shell in this pre­sumed, and only viable, life orientation. Some early German paleobiologists, after discovering this fact from hydrodynamic experiments, actually postu­lated that Gryphaea might have lived in such a side-down position. But Hal­lam (1968) and others argue convincingly that a shell on its side would soon become clogged with mud, rendering the animal unable to feed. Moreover, once the heavy shell is tipped, the animal cannot right itself — so quick death would seem to follow as an inevitable consequence of such displacement from the bilateral living position.

We therefore assume that stabilization of a shell that must coil to rise above a muddy substrate represents a fundamental functional problem for gryphaeate oysters. (Indeed, the most strongly coiled Gryphaea incurva, the ancestral state of the Jurassic sequence, developed an especially thickened lower valve, presumably to gain stability by ballasting such a non-optimal form.)

Hallam's persuasive flow tank experiments (1968) identified the morpho­logical changes that could provide greater shell stability in an evolutionary lineage beginning with the problematical G. incurva: namely, larger size, broader shells, and decreased coiling. The evident conclusion now simply fol­lows: if natural selection favored all these traits as conjoined enhancers of essential stability, wouldn't its action be greatly aided by any internal mecha­nism that happened to bias variation in these directions, or to forge correla­tions among these jointly beneficial characters?

Fortunately, all the morphological features already exist within the ontogenetic (and strongly allometric) channel of the founding member, G. in­curva — for young shells of this ancestral species are relatively broader and less coiled than the adults that will develop from them. If these features can be brought forward by paedomorphosis into later ontogeny, greater stability can be achieved.

Heterochrony now seals the case and intensifies the joint benefit. Neoteny often operates through a correlation of juvenile form with rapid growth rates of the young organism. If these rapid rates can be prolonged into later ontog­eny, then juvenile form can also be “promoted” to the adult stage — and the adult shell will also increase substantially in size (at any age in common with ancestors). Thus, as an automatic consequence of heterochronic correlations, working within a pre-set allometric channel of ancestral ontogeny, all three adaptive desiderata for greater shell stability can evolve in tandem as conse­quences of a single focus of selection — that is, for prolongation of rapid juve­nile growth rates. By thus linking all the valued characters, and evoking their common expression by one basic developmental change, positive constraints work synergistically with natural selection to produce an apparently complex set of adaptive changes with relative ease and speed.





Ontogenetically channeled allometric constraint as a primary

basis of expressed evolutionary variation: the full geographic and

morphological range of Cerion uva


Since snail shells preserve a complete record of ontogeny in a unitary and rigid structure that generally cannot be modified after initial formation (at least in exterior expression, whereas the shell interior can often be altered through secondary resorption and deposition by appressing soft tissues), this taxon presents unusual opportunities for the study of developmental con­straints. Evolution in any character, whether caused by selection or not, must automatically elicit a suite of correlated responses throughout such an inte­gral and integrated structure.

However, the isometric growth model of the logarithmic spiral, so often assumed to apply to the actual growth of most mollusks will greatly limit the expression of such constraints based on “correlations of growth” (Darwin's own phrase), because such a logarithmic shell does not change its shape through ontogeny (D'Arcy Thompson, 1917), and heterochrony therefore loses its power to alter the form of descendants by general retardation or ac­celeration — for the juvenile shell looks just like a scaled-down adult, and global paedomorphosis, for example, would therefore exert no effect upon form. But when shells grow with pronounced allometry, then positive chan­nels of constraint attain great potential for influencing or directing the evolu­tion of phenotypes (as expressed in a complex, rigid structure, preserving a complete and unaltered record of ontogeny, where any change must elicit a cascade of correlated consequences, and where strong allometries establish a rich playing field for effective heterochrony).

In fact, molluscan shells rarely grow as idealized logarithmic spirals, and nearly all forms, even such prototypes of supposed isometry as the gastropod genus Turritella, actually grow with measurable allometry (Andrews, 1971). Moreover, Vermeij (1980) and Kemp and Bertness (1984) have presented strong theoretical arguments for regarding an allometry of doming (relative increase of height to width) as a predictable consequence of general modes of growth in gastropods. In any case, the West Indian land snail Cerion, the pri­mary subject of my own research, and perhaps the most phenotypically di­verse genus of land snails, grows with strong and invariant allometry in three recognizable stages (Fig. 10-7): an early button-shaped or triangular phase with width increasing far more rapidly than height; an intermediary “barrel” phase, where width increases slowly or not at all, and height grows rapidly; and a final twisting of the aperture (phase 3 of Fig. 10-7), before deposition of the definitive adult lip. In fact, Cerion owes its name — from the Greek word for wax, in reference to the characteristic shape of beehives — to the form pro­duced by the first two allometric phases, particularly in species with a rela­tively sharp transition between the upper button and the middle barrel.

I have used inductive multivariate biometry to identify, and then to judge the extent of influence for groups of ontogenetically correlated characters (“covariance sets” in my terminology) that are both mechanically enforced by allometric growth, and that also exert substantial, often controlling, im­pact upon patterns of temporal and geographic variation in the phenotypic history of species. These covariance sets usually dominate several major axes of orthogonal variation detected in such techniques as factor and discrim­inant analysis (see Gould and Woodruff, 1986, for a detailed application; Gould, 1989a, for a general statement; and Gould, 1992b, for an analysis of the infamous “square snails” in the Cerion dimidiatum complex of Cuba, a phenotype that Maynard Smith had declared “impossible” at the 1980 Chi­cago macroevolution meeting in order to acknowledge that even he, as a strict Darwinian, did not deny a role for constraint in precluding access to certain regions of morphospace. His principle cannot be gainsaid, but his ap­plication failed because he assumed a logarithmic spiral model, thus forbid­ding the square shape that can be attained only by intense allometry; but Cerion's allometry leads precisely to such squareness at the extreme of con­trast and sudden transition between allometric phases one and two).

To cite an example from one species (as a prototype for demonstrating the dominating relative influence that such constraints can exert in particular sit­uations), one of the major covariance sets of Cerion's allometry — the “jigsaw

constraint” of my terminology (Gould, 1989a) — may seem almost trivial in its obvious nature, but still exerts great influence in setting patterns of varia­tion within Cerion at all levels, from intrapopulational variation, to geo­graphic variation within a species, to chronoclines, to regional patterns of dif­ferentiation in species complexes (see Gould, 1989a, for details). If different shells reach virtually the same final size — and Cerion, as one of its major bio-metric advantages does, unlike most invertebrates, reach a final size marked by the secretion of a thickened lip in the third allometric phase — then shells with larger whorls must end their growth with fewer whorls. (In two jigsaw puzzles with frames of the same size, the one with smaller pieces must use more pieces to fill the common space — hence my name for the covariance set.)

The basic principle might be regarded as both obvious and entirely unprofound. Its operation would also impose scant effect upon any molluscan shell that grew in close conformity with the idealized logarithmic spiral — for two shells of the same size, one with few and the other with many whorls, would then display the same shape, and no substantial differences (beyond the num­ber of whorls) would be apparent. But Cerion's extensive and distinctive allometry triggers a large and visually striking set of correlated changes, necessarily leading to obvious differences in form between few and many whorled shells of the same size. (Such distinctions can be readily charac­terized, and judged in relative strength, on factor or discriminant axes of multivariate biometric studies.) For example, large-whorled specimens grow fewer whorls and therefore undergo a later transition to the second allometric phase (which invariably occurs between the 5th and 6th whorl), thereby yielding a more triangular adult shell, as relatively less of the total growth oc­curs during the “barrel” of the second allometric phase.

This single constraint, with its complex sequelae, explains virtually all the interregional geographic variation in one of the most interesting, and cer­tainly the most intensely studied, species of Cerion — the geographic and mor­phological outlier (also the holotype of the genus, and a species named by Linnaeus himself), Cerion uva from Aruba, Bonaire and Curasao. Moreover, recognition of the jigsaw constraint allowed me to resolve, in a manner con­genial to all parties, the most substantial and longstanding debate in the his­tory of Cerion studies.

In a large monograph, published in 1924, H. B. Baker, a great descriptive malacologist, claimed that he could distinguish four geographic domains of variation by subtle but entirely characteristic differences in shell form: Aruba, Bonaire, Eastern Curasao and Western Curasao. (The island of Curasao, shaped like a dumbbell with eastern and western portions joined by a much narrower neck of land, may be sensibly so divided; the two halves were prob­ably separated by higher sea levels of former interglacial epochs.) Baker used the classical and subjective criterion of a taxonomist's “good eye,” and could therefore not defend his impressions in the face of extensive biometrical stud­ies by Hummelinck (1940), then extended and confirmed by De Vries (1974). These Dutch researchers, unable to identify covariance sets with their univariate and bivariate techniques, claimed that intrasample variation in mean shell size swamped all other factors. Moreover, they could locate no clear evi­dence at all for Baker's interregional distinctions.

By using multivariate methods to study the influence of covariance sets, particularly the jigsaw constraint, upon geographic variation, I was able to resolve this question (Gould, 1984b) in a way that honored (as partial) the findings of all these excellent researchers. The Dutch scientists correctly noted the strong influence of variation in mean shell size among samples. But I was able to show: (1) that this variation can be isolated on a single factor axis; (2) that size ranges among samples are effectively equal, and influence the shells in essentially the same way in each of the four regions; and (3) that these intraregional differences in size almost surely arise for ecophenotypic reasons (see argument and documentation in Gould, 1984b), based on more vigorous and continuous growth of shells in moist and well vegetated microhabitats.

But I also discovered that each of Baker's four regions could be clearly identified by the evolution of differences that may be small in a genetic sense (a common situation for geographic variation within species), but that produce substantial effects upon the adult phenotype by altering several key char­acters in tandem through constraints of ontogenetic channels identified by covariance sets. For example, shells from Bonaire (see Fig. 10-8) grow a dis­tinctively jutting apertural lip, a consequence of conjoined modification in characters building the third allometric phase.

Effectively all other geographic variation could be ascribed to the jigsaw constraint. For reasons that I could not resolve, Cerion develops virtually no variation in average adult shell size (measured as height plus width) within lo­cal populations in each of Baker's four regions — with a range from 29.79 mm in Eastern Curasao to 30.69 mm for Aruba, giving a maximum interregional difference of only 1.6 percent. This contingently evolved (and not, obviously, geometrically necessary) invariance of size triggers a maximal effect for the jigsaw constraint — that is, so long as substantial variation exists in the sizes of whorls.

Cerion uva does, in fact, exhibit extensive and geographically distinctive variation in whorl sizes, with regional means spanning almost a full whorl, and ranging from 8.56 whorls in Western Curasao to 9.35 in Aruba. The maximal “play” thus accorded to the jigsaw constraint then establishes the interregional distinctions that Baker had correctly noted but could not ade­quately characterize. Figure 10-9 shows minimum convex polygons drawn around the multivariate means for samples in each region (in a study based on 135 samples of 19 measures on each of 20 snails). The corners of the trian­gular diagram represent the first three axes of a factor analysis for mean vec­tors of samples. The three axes hold nearly equal explanatory power (30.5, 34.2, and 32.6 percent respectively, for a total of 97.3 percent of all information in the 19 measures among samples).

The second axis absorbs the intersample differences in size that led Hummelinck and de Vries to miss the regional distinctions. The extensive variation on this dimension does not differentiate the four regions, as indicated by the similar orientation of each polygon along this axis. (In an interesting excep­tion, a few ancient samples (2000 to 3000 years old by radiocarbon) from In­dian middens on Curacao (see Gould, 1971a), shown in the small polygon marked I on Fig. 10-9, include far larger shells with sample means well out­side the range of modern variation — as shown by their localized and maxi­mized values on this second axis.)

The first and third axes express different aspects of the jigsaw constraint. By these methods, we can isolate this interregional component (on truly inde­pendent, mathematically orthogonal axes) from the substantial intraregional variation in size that obscured the broader geographic pattern in the studies of Hummelinck and de Vries. We can also assess the relative strengths of these two sources in compositing the total amount of difference among sample means. Baker's interregional differences explain about % of the total variation among sample means. And, with the exception of Bonaire's distinction by a

The Bonaire shells grow a jutting apertural lip arising from changes in the third allometric phase. All other major variation can be ascribed to the jigsaw constraint. The Aruba snails, with their small whorls, reach the same final size as modern Curacao specimens — with all major aspects or their markedly different shape arising as consequences of different lengths of residence, based on whorl sizes, in the first two allomecric phases.





different covariance set, expressed on the fourth axis of this analysis (as dis­cussed previously), effectively all interregional difference arises from the op­eration of the jigsaw constraint — as generated by minor differences in whorl sizes promoted to substantial overall phenotypic effect through the allometric consequences of Cerion's ontogenetic channel, so long as average adult shells, as they do in this case, reach the same final size.

Note, in Figure 10-9, the separation of polygons for Aruba, Eastern Curasao and Western Curasao by the first and third axes that express the jig­saw constraint, while each polygon shows a similar extension along the sec­ond axis, representing the different and separable component of intraregional (and ecophenotypic) variation in mean shell size. Figure 10-8 shows charac­teristic shells for the regions. Note the jutting apertures from Bonaire (second row) and, especially, the contrast, built by the jigsaw constraint, between many-whorled specimens from Aruba in the top row (longer relative resi­dence in the second allometric phrase which, distinctively in Cerion uva, in­duces an absolute narrowing in later whorls, leading to a “barrel” shape for the entire shell, fat in the middle and narrowing at both ends) — and the fewer whorled, but same sized, specimens from Western Curasao in the third row (which pass less of their ontogeny in the second “barrel” phase and therefore do not become constricted towards the end of growth, as in the Aruba specimens).





10-9. Minimum convex polygons drawn around the multivariate means for sam­ples in each region. The ecophenotypic factor of size makes no distinctions as each polygon becomes elongated along this second axis, and as the truly larger fossil shells from Aruba occupy a separate position at the high size end of this spectrum. But the first and third axes express the jigsaw constraint, and the de­fining regional geographic variation within this type species of the genus achieves clear expression in the separation of polygons on these axes.





If a constraint engendered by an allometric channel in ontogeny can so control the regional pattern of geographic variation in an important species of such a well-studied genus, then we cannot deny a major role to this posi­tive mode of evolutionary change by developmental constraint.





THE APTIVE TRIANGLE AND THE SECOND POSITIVE MEANING: CONSTRAINT AS A THEORY-BOUND TERM FOR PATTERNS AND DIRECTIONS NOT BUILT EXCLUSIVELY (OR SOMETIMES EVEN AT ALL) BY NATURAL SELECTION





The model of the aptive triangle


In a classic line of contemporary American literature, W. P. Kinsella writes of a midwestern farmer so beguiled by the legend of the great baseball hero Shoeless Joe Jackson that he constructs a stadium in his wheatfield because he heard a voice saying to him: “if you build it, he will come.” I often feel that many modern evolutionary biologists unconsciously obey a similar mantra in their approach to the phenotypic features of organisms: “if it works well, then natural selection made it.”

In two historical discussion of this book's first part — my analysis of Dar­win's fateful words at the end of chapter 6 of the Origin of Species (pp. 251-260), and my presentation of “Galton's Polyhedron” as the most effective formalist or structuralist metaphor for illustrating missing alternatives in schemes of evolutionary causality that consider natural selection as the only mechanism of change (pp. 342–351) — I presented triangular models of causal poles for the origin of phenotypic features: a representation well suited for portraying alternatives and complements to natural selection as the causal basis of organic form.

Let me now propose a slightly different triangular model with the same three poles, but now representing only organismal features that “work well” both in the classical sense of good biomechanical design, and the technical meaning of conferring fitness upon organisms in their interaction with envi­ronments — in other words, to the features that biological terminology, and ordinary vernacular usage, call “adaptations,” but that I would rather desig­nate as “aptations” (see Gould and Vrba, 1982), a more general term that ac­knowledges their current utility while remaining agnostic about their source of origin. I will therefore designate this model (modified from Seilacher, 1970, and ultimately traceable to Galton's Polyhydron) as “the aptive triangle” (though I will submit to standard “loose” (or sensu lato) usage, and usually refer to the features plotted upon this diagram by the only term that current language recognizes — namely, adaptations).

The basic diagram (Fig. 10-10, presented before, in part, as Fig. 4-6) desig­nates three vertices as idealized end members and also recognizes, of course, that almost any actual feature will plot either along an edge (influenced by two vertices), or, more frequently, in the triangle's interior (where all three end members contribute). This mode of ternary plotting has been used most frequently by petrologists for depicting the composition of actual rocks as amalgamations of three idealized end-members, in full expectation that few, if any, real rocks will include only one end-member and plot right at one of the triangle's vertices.

In keeping with my previous discussion, and with Seilacher's original conception, we may call these idealized end-members “functional,” “historical,” and “structural.” In other words, any phenotypic feature now “working well” for an organism may have been constructed by a process that directly crafted the feature for its current function (the first corner), inherited from an ancestral form (the second corner), or built by some structural mechanism or process not directly related to, or engendered by, the functional needs of the organism.

As discussed in my previous analysis of Darwin's brilliant argument in Chapter 6 of the Origin (pp. 251-260), the argument for natural selection as the dominant cause of evolutionary change must be made in the following way under the aegis of this model (as Darwin did, but without constructing any formal picture like Fig. 10-10): At the functional vertex, natural selection stands alone as the only known and effective cause in this mode. If the Lamarckian mechanism operated in nature, then inheritance of acquired and adaptive characters would provide another functionalist option for explain­ing the origin of working design. But inheritance does not so operate, on this planet at least. (Darwin took the more generous view that Lamarckian inheri­tance might exist, but at a relative frequency distinctly subsidiary to natural selection.)

At the historical vertex, working features passively inherited from ances­tors did not originate to meet current functional needs. But so long as these

Standard triangular diagrams for depicting basic causes of form as func­tional (immediate adaptation to current circumstances), historical (inherited by homology, whatever the basis of ancestral origin), and structural, or arising ei­ther as physical consequence of other features or directly from the nature of physical forces acting on biological materials. All vertices may yield aptive traits of great utility to the organism.





features arose initially by natural selection in the ancestral line, then their ul­timate origin remains functional — and natural selection, as previously noted, represents the only known (for Darwin, the only effective) cause of functional change. Finally, at the structural vertex, Darwin allowed that features not arising for functional reasons, but only coopted for current utility, must be admitted as genuine exceptions to the principle that adaptive features can only originate for functional reasons (with natural selection as the only known and sufficiently powerful functional mechanism). But he then de­moted this class of real exceptions by the standard argument in studies of natural history: he claimed, invoking the classical justifications of “sequelae” and “nooks and crannies” (see p. 1249), that currently adaptive features with nonadaptive structural origins must, by their rarity, reach only an insig­nificant relative frequency among evolved traits of organisms.

The impeccable logic of this formulation can help critics by clarifying how any potential argument against this hegemony of natural selection must pro­ceed. At the functional vertex, one would have to identify other important mechanisms in addition to natural selection — and none have been proposed, at least to the satisfaction of this author (although the argument for “a lit­tle bit of bacterial Lamarckism” — as I like to characterize the controversial claims of Cairns et al. (1988) — may have some merit in a limited domain).

At the historical vertex, one would have to reject the contention that constraining homologies of inheritance, and the resulting heterogeneous clump­ing of species in organic morphospace, record the consequences of natural se­lection in constructing the novel traits of ancestral forms, followed by the continuing control of selection upon subsequent patterns of phyletic change in descendant lineages — an argument that I will advance in Section II of this chapter. Finally, at the structural vertex, one would have to counter Darwin's argument by asserting that he greatly underestimated the relative frequencies of these admitted exceptions to natural selection for the origin of currently functional features — a claim that I will advance in Chapter 11. Thus, the form of Chapters 10 and 11, and my argument for the importance of struc­tural constraints at high relative frequency in the origin of currently adaptive organismal characters, will center upon recent arguments for a reconceptualization of the historical vertex, and for a reevaluation of relative frequency at the structural vertex of the aptive triangle.





Distinguishing and sharpening the two great questions




THE STRUCTURAL VERTEX. I shall begin with the simple and more direct question posed from the structural vertex: does the existence of current adap­tations necessarily imply their functional origin at all (either as a direct re­sponse to current environments, or by inheritance of traits with a function­alist origin at their ancestral inception)? How, in other words, can good Darwinian design (aptations in my favored restriction, adaptations in the ver­nacular) arise by processes that do not involve functional adaptation?

Since this category is defined negatively — to designate causes of functional characters not evolved by functionalist mechanisms — the structural vertex becomes something of a miscellaneous repository, as Seilacher (1970) recog­nized for the same end member (that he called bautechnischer, or archi­tectural). In particular, the structural vertex includes two strikingly differ­ent subcategories, united in their common appeal to physical consequences rather than functional crafting, but otherwise strikingly disparate, even dia­metrically opposite, in their implications for a key question, admittedly sub­sidiary to our present inquiry about structural vs. functional origin, but of central importance to evolutionary study in general: namely, the role of his­tory and contingency in the interpretation of evolutionary lineages.

I shall consider these two structural categories seriatim, and in depth, in Chapter 11, and will therefore only present the basic conceptual framework here. In the first category, some adaptive features of organisms may be di­rectly molded by, or may originate as immediate and deterministic conse­quences of, the physical properties of matter and the dynamical nature of forces — in other words, not by an accumulative process of functional honing through selection, and not (for that matter) by any uniquely biological pro­cess at all. When Williams (1966) famously, if a bit facetiously, remarked that we shouldn't consider a flying fish's capacity to fall back into the water as an adaptation because their descent represents a necessary consequence of physi­cal mass — even though this capacity may be vital to the continued life of the fish, and therefore strongly aptive — he invoked a direct physical property of matter (not subject to alteration by selection at all in this case!).

D'Arcy Thompson's (1917, 1942) theory — that physical forces directly im­pose an optimal biomechanical form upon plastic organic material — marks the admittedly idiosyncratic locus classicus for this general attitude (see pp. 1179–1208). Stuart Kauffman's (1993) interesting concept of “order for free” (good design automatically generated by nature's laws, with no need for laborious construction by a particular biological process like natural selec­tion) provides the most fruitful current context for this approach to aptive or­ganic design.

In the second category that Darwin designated as “correlations of growth,” and Gould and Lewontin (1979) called spandrels, features arise nonadaptively as physically necessary consequences of other changes that may (and, in all probability, usually do) have an adaptive basis, or as inevita­ble and unselected sequelae of general organic designs (that, again, generally arise for conventional functional reasons).

Nonselected origin for structural reasons defines the common ground of the two categories — directly generated by physical forces in the first, indi­rectly developed as correlated consequences in the second. But the philosoph­ical implications of these two bases could not be more different in one crucial respect — hence the oppositional stance often adopted between champions of the two modes, despite their acknowledged common ground at the vertex of nonselected origin by physical necessity.

Pure D'Arcy Thompsonians maintain little interest in history and phylogeny, and may even become overtly hostile to the commanding influence of these concepts in evolutionary biology. After all, if a trait arises by physical necessity, why should we care about the specific contingencies that brought this or that lineage into the domain of the particular physical law under study. At any time, any lineage located in this domain must behave in the same way. This version of structuralism embraces the classical spatiotemporal invariance of natural law, and cares little (if at all) about historical pathways that happen to potentiate the law's operation in any particular case. Most evolu­tionists (including the author of this book) are historians at heart, and must view such derisory dismissal of phylogeny as anathema, however fascinating they find (as I do) the partial validity of this theme, and however much they may admire (and bravo again from this observer) the inimitable power of D'Arcy Thompson's prose style.

Spandrelists, in strong contrast, generally share the evolutionary biologist's traditional fascination for contingent details of history in individual lineages under study. Spandrels do express general and predictable properties, but they originate as necessary consequences of particular triggers that can only be understood in a historical and phylogenetic context. If Julia Pastrana grew two rows of teeth as a correlated consequence of her abnormal hairiness (see p. 338 for a discussion of this example from Darwin's writing), then the forced correlation, set (in Darwin's view) by the constraining homology of hair and teeth, records and reflects the phyletic uniqueness of mammalian de­velopment (not the operation of invariant, universal laws), even if the extra teeth grew by enforced physical necessity. And even though the spandrels of San Marco must be built once the architects decide to mount hemisphaerical domes on four adjacently orthogonal rounded arches, we can only under­stand the basic blueprint that necessarily engendered the spandrels by study­ing the particular history of ecclesiastical architecture.





THE HISTORICAL VERTEX. The structural vertex poses a direct question about the origin of currently adaptive features themselves: what percentage of items in this category did not originate by a process of adaptation, but were coopted for present utility from non-adaptive beginnings? If we can de­termine a high relative frequency in general, or even if we could only specify a subset of crucial evolutionary situations for such nonadaptive origins, then an exclusively adaptationist theory for the genesis of aptive structures will no longer suffice, and evolutionary theory will require enrichment from struc­turalist alternatives promoted to a more than marginal or peripheral status.

The historical vertex, on the other hand, poses a more indirect challenge that might better be designated as a metaquestion: Given a functional origin for presently adaptive features (either by immediate construction for a cur­rent role, or by adaptive origin in an ancestor, with subsequent maintenance by homology in descent), may we also regard the markedly inhomogeneous distributions of organisms across the potential morphospace of good organic design as a best set of solutions to functional problems, or do we need to in­voke internal constraints and channels to explain substantial aspects of this decidedly “clumped,” and decisively non-random, occupation of a theoreti­cal “design space”?

In other words — and I label the inquiry as a “metaquestion” for this rea­son — in what ways does the skewed and partial occupancy of the attainable morphospace of adaptive design record the operation of internal constraints (both negative limitations and positive channels), and not only the simple failure of a limited number of unconstrained lineages to reach all possible po­sitions in the allotted time? (Geological history may be long, and the number of evolutionary lineages immense, but even these substantial quantities must be risibly small compared with the number of spatiotemporal positions in po­tentially “colonizable” morphospace.)

In attempting to explain such non-random clumping in adaptive morpho­space, Darwinians have traditionally emphasized the contingency of limited time and numbers — rather than any failure to populate accessible regions as a consequence of active constraint — because their functionalist theory presup­poses the power of natural selection to break such constraints (whose exis­tence, needless to say, they cannot and do not wish to deny), and the conse­quent accessibility (at different levels of effort and probability, to be sure) of all physically possible adaptive designs.

If the influence of historical constraints must be integrated with the con­ventional mechanism of unfettered adaptive exploration (limited by accidents of historical opportunity) to explain the markedly non-random clumping of actual organisms in the potential morphospace of adaptive and theoretically accessible organic form, then this metaquestion about nonfunctional causes for the distribution of adaptive features poses a different kind of challenge to our usual views about the power and range of natural selection in the expla­nation of functional design.

In my presentation thus far, I have epitomized this crucial issue in an ab­stract way, but I shall, in the final section of this chapter, present the empirical results — primarily from the burgeoning study of genetic bases for the major developmental patterns of organic Bauplan (“evo-devo,” or evolution of de­velopment to its devotees) — that have so surprised the biological sciences in recent years, bringing this new study of ancient themes to the forefront of our science.

I shall argue that two prominent discoveries have magnified the importance of historical constraints vs. the free operation of natural selection to a point where this historical aspect of constraint can no longer be denied prominence in designating the causes of evolutionary change: First, “deep homology” or the discovery that major phyla, separated by more than 500 million years of independent evolutionary history, still share substantial (if not predominant) channels of development based on levels of genetic retention that proponents of the Modern Synthesis had specifically declared inconceivable, given the presumed power of natural selection to modify any independent line in its own uniquely adaptive direction. Second, the importance of parallelism (a concept rooted in internal constraint) for explaining independently evolved features of distant phyla; traits long touted as textbook examples of convergence (a concept rooted in externally conditioned adaptation).

I shall also argue that deep homology often embodies the “negative” empirical theme of constraints as limitation, while parallelism features the “positive” empirical theme of constraints as enabling channels. Both themes, however, have forced evolutionary biologists to reassess the importance of constraints at the historical vertex for explaining the actual distribution of adaptive form within potential organic morphospace. In this sense, both themes count as “positive” in my second (or conceptual) sense that any pow­erful argument challenging a stale and limiting consensus must be treasured in science.

No good or experienced naturalist could ever fully espouse the reductionistic belief that all problems of organic form might be answered by dis­solving organisms into separate features, each with a specified function, and each optimized independently by natural selection. But theories do drive, or at least nudge, adherents towards their extreme formulations — and even such sophisticated versions of Darwinism as the Modern Synthesis (see Chapter 7) biased the perspectives of biologists in this direction by advocating natural se­lection as, effectively, the sole cause of evolutionary change. Various pleas, heard with increasing frequency during the past generation (Goodwin, 1994, for example), to “put the organism back into evolution,” or to “reestablish a meaningful science of morphology,” should be understood as expressions of a growing conviction that theories of part-by-part functionalism cannot ex­plain the major patterns of life's history and current morphological distri­bution.

We do need to reformulate, in modern and operational ways, the old no­tions of organic integrity, and structural determination from the “inside” of genetics and development, thus balancing our former functionalist faith in the full efficacy of adaptationism with positive concepts of internal and struc­tural constraint. Only in this way can we forge a unified science of form to in­tegrate the architecture and history of organisms with their daily struggles to survive, prosper, and propagate in a complex ecological surround — a world that Western culture once perceived as “the face of nature bright with glad­ness” (Darwin, 1859, p. 62), but that we now recognize as the material do­main of natural selection, a process carrying no moral implications for human life (thus permitting us to throw aside the crutch of comforting imagery that Darwin so rightly rejected), but operating with relentless (though not ex­clusive) force throughout living nature.





An epitome for the theory-bound nature of constraint terminology


We may use the model of the aptive triangle to illustrate how my second, or conceptually “positive,” meaning of constraint (including both the “positive” and “negative” empirical modes of channels and limits) rests upon the the­ory-bound nature of all scientific terms and definitions. As I argued previ­ously (see pp. 1032–1037), if we designate a set of causes as canonical within an orthodox theory, then vernacular usage designates other causes lying out­side the theory, but nonetheless influencing phenomena that should fall under the aegis of orthodoxy, as “constraints” upon the power or validity of the standard theory. (My designation of such constraints as “positive” then follows the usual ethos of science in placing special value on new ideas that chal­lenge complacent conventionalities.) In this crucial sense, the identification of certain causes as constraints depends upon the claims and nature of a stan­dard theory.

The historical and structural vertices of the aptive triangle become sources of constraint when this standard theory emanates from the third, or func­tional, vertex — as classical Darwinism does, and as Darwin himself so clearly specified in his own analysis of the three vertices (without explicitly identify­ing such a model) in closing Chapter 6, entitled “Difficulties on Theory,” in the Origin of Species — again, see pp. 251-260 of this book for my analysis of this key Darwinian argument). In making this “pure end-member” analysis of canonical causes vs. constraints, I am consciously presenting extreme, or cardboard, versions of central theories in order to clarify a logical (and termi­nological) point about the naming of expectations and exceptions. (Just as I argued previously that no actual empirical case would fall precisely at a vertex of total determination by one factor alone, I also acknowledge that no subtle thinker's theory will fall right on a vertex either. Nonetheless, discus­sion in terms of pure end-members may be defended as a conceptual device for clarifying the central content and primary commitment of more complex theories.)

Figure 10-11 illustrates the changing terminology of constraint and con­vention under three pure end-member theories of causation at vertices of the aptive triangle. For the pure adaptationist, committed to natural selection as the controlling and functionalist mechanism of evolutionary change, all causes of currently adaptive form that cannot be attributed to direct selec­tion for immediate utility must count as constraints. (Fig. 10-1 la depicts this version, with the canonical cause placed at the functional vertex, and with other vertices making contributions that then be called constraints upon the full and free operation of current natural selection to forge immediate utility.)

As another virtue of these simplified representations, we can also grasp how any pure end-member theorist must treat the exceptions (“constraints”) that cannot be denied as causal contributors to currently adaptive form. In this case (Fig. 10-lla), I have already noted Darwin's own excellent strategy (see pp. 251-260): admit the historical inputs, but attribute their cause to natural selection in the past; then admit the structural inputs as genuine ex­ceptions, but relegate them to a low and insignificant relative frequency. Thus, all “constraints” either record the operation of the canonical mechanism in the past, or stand as genuine exceptions rendered impotent by their rarity.

But if I were committed to a view that the direct action of physical forces (as expressed in the spatiotemporal invariance of natural law) builds the adaptive forms of organisms directly, and without any appeal to functionalist or distinctively biological principles like natural selection — D'Arcy Thomp­son, in fact, advocated this general view in as pure a form as any 20th cen­tury biologist dared to espouse (see pp. 1179–1208) — then the structural





10-11a. What we label as primary causes and what we consider as constraints follow from the logic of our preferred theory. Under strictly functional views of natural selection, the functional vertex represents the orthodox cause of current action by natural selection, whereas the historical vertex imposes constraints based on past adaptations and the structural vertex imposes architectural constraints based on limitation in the nature of building materials.





10-11b. For a structuralist thinker like D'Arcy Thompson, optimal forms built directly by physical laws become canonical, and influences from other vertices become constraints — either of ecological particulars from the functional vertex, or of contingency from the historical vertex.





10-11c. For a cladist interested in historical reconstruction of branching sequences, the historical vertex becomes primary, and influences from the other two vertices represent constraints — ahistorical constraints of universal physics from the structural vertex and autapomorphies of particular and immediate adaptation from the functional vertex.





vertex becomes the locus of canonical causes, while contributions from the other two vertices become constraints upon full determination by general laws of nature.

Under this theory (Fig. 10-11b), adaptive form arises from the operation of general laws upon biological materials. But if, to understand any current ad­aptation, we need to invoke strictures based either upon: (1) passive inheri­tance within a specifically designated genealogical system (a constraint from the historical vertex, imposed by a unique and contingent biological particu­lar, thus detracting from a claim for full causation by general laws); or (2) upon the immediate construction of a particular adaptation by a biological process tied to specifics of adaptive pressures in one environment at one time (a constraint from the functional vertex of current natural selection) — then the full power of the purely physical model becomes compromised. Thus, as I show in Figure 10-11b, a purely physicalist theory for the direct generation of adaptive form by spatiotemporally invariant laws of nature, places its canoni­cal mechanism at the structural vertex, and regards inputs from both the historical vertex (strictures from past particulars) and the functional vertex (strictures imposed by the specifics of current biological situations) as con­straints.

Finally (Fig. 10-11c), a pure (and caricatured) cladist, who believes that the reconstruction of genealogical pattern (without reference to modes of causa­tion) defines the goal and purpose of evolutionary biology, would locate his canonical mechanisms at the historical vertex, and view contributions from the other two vertices as constraints upon his ability to detect a pure genea­logical signal in the currently adaptive traits of organisms. Influences from the structural vertex must be counted as constraints because their timeless generality covers or distorts the desired signal of particular history with an unwanted contribution from causes with no specific genealogical content. And influences from the functional vertex impose a confusing immediate par­ticular — an autapomorphy offering no help at all in the reconstruction of lin­eages, and therefore conventionally omitted in cladistic analysis — degrading a phyletic signal that might otherwise map the organism's position in the ge­nealogical system of a more general lineage. (This insight about particular and immediately adaptive features — autapomorphies in cladistic terminology — has long been regarded as a truism in taxonomic practice. Darwin himself frequently emphasized (1859, chapter 13) that new and unique adapta­tions can only confound taxonomic relationships, and that systematists must privilege characters with broad homological residence in the taxa of larger genealogical groupings.)

Thus, the cardboard Darwinian functionalist, the cardboard physical structuralist, and the cardboard genealogical cladist each chooses a different vertex for canonical causation, and must then define influences from the other two vertices as constraints upon the efficacy of his orthodox mecha­nism. My examples are purposefully cartoonish, but the principle thus illus­trated represents an important, and insufficiently appreciated, generality in science — the theory-bound nature of terms, and particularly, in this case, the designation as “constraint” of all evolutionary causes lying outside the range of orthodox mechanisms, thereby compromising their power and generality. We should regard this terminological notion of constraint as positive in its ca­pacity to question accepted ways of thinking — the theme that shall now structure the remainder of this chapter.

A HISTORICAL AND CONCEPTUAL ANALYSIS OF THE UNDERAPPRECIATED IMPORTANCE OF PARALLELISM FOR EVOLUTIONARY THEORY





A context for excitement


The last chapter of my first book, Ontogeny and Phylogeny, published in 1977, amounted to little more than a terminal exercise in frustration. I had written 500 pages on the history and evolutionary meaning of heterochrony, and had then been stymied, at the point of potential synthesis, by an inability to relate the well-documented (and reasonably well understood) subject of macroevolutionary changes wrought by shifts in developmental timing to any viable analysis (or even description) of the underlying genetic and embryological mechanisms.

I could only wave my hands and write a few vague paragraphs about the putative importance of “regulatory” genes — then an almost purely abstract concept (at least for eukaryotic development), based on no direct documen­tation of any worth, and supported only by three inferential forms of argu­ment: analogies to rudimentary knowledge about the different systems of prokaryotic regulation (primarily the work of Jacob and Monod); general models suggesting the necessity of a regulatory hierarchy, with some genes operating as primary controls on rates and placements of structural genes and their products (Britten and Davidson, 1971); and such conclusions by negative inference as King and Wilson's (1975) famous calculation of more than 99 percent identity between human and chimp polypeptides, im­plying that the considerable phenotypic differences between the two species must therefore reside in the action of a small class of unknown regulatory genes.

Of course, this frustration only recorded a technological inability to specify these regulators, not any failure to grasp the centrality of the subject. I wrote (1977b, p. 406): “The most important event in evolutionary biology during the past decade has been the development of electrophoretic techniques for the routine measurement of genetic variation in natural populations. Yet this imposing edifice of new data and interpretation rests upon the shaky founda­tion of its concentration on structural genes alone (faute de mieux, to be sure; it is notoriously difficult to measure differences in genes that vary only in the timing and amount of their products in ontogeny, while genes that code for stable proteins are easily assessed).”

Barely 20 years later, this statement reads like a quaint conceptual fossil from an “ancient” time of crossbows and arquebuses, when we could only re­construct the anatomy of genes from their protein products (and could not recognize regulatory genes that did not deposit such results in explicit flesh and blood). I therefore succumbed to the necessity of technical limits and ended a long book with the weakest of conclusions — a future hope, however heartfelt and (in retrospect) accurately surmised: “I believe that an under­standing of regulation must lie at the center of any rapprochement between molecular and evolutionary biology; for a synthesis of the two biologies will surely take place, if it occurs at all, on the common field of development” (Gould, 1977b, p. 408).

Now, as I begin this chapter in the summer of 1999, I can only express both my joy and astonishment at a subsequent speed of resolution and discovery that has sustained my predictions, but also made my earlier book effectively obsolete, not only within my own lifetime, but during my active mid-career. The field of evolutionary developmental biology (known as “evo-devo” to practitioners), while still in its infancy, has invented the tools — and already cashed out a host of stunning and unexpected examples — for decoding the basic genetic structure of regulation, and for tracing the locations and timings of regulatory networks in the early development of complex multicellular creatures.

But this very pace of growth and excitement presents a problem for a book like this, with a “lead time” measured in months to years, rather than the professional journal's weeks to months or the popular press's days. The dis­coveries of deep homology and pervasive parallelism among phyla separated for more than 500 million years continue to accumulate at an accelerating pace, based on methodological refinements and extensions, in both speed and accuracy that could hardly have been conceptualized even a decade ago.

This situation places me in a quandary (although I could hardly imagine a happier form of puzzlement). The data of evo-devo constitute the largest and most exciting body of novel empirics to support this book's general thesis. Since I have tried to provide thorough overviews of empirical documentation for other central elements of my overall theory, I should now be tabulating and evaluating these cases of deep genetic homology in extenso. But I am hoist by my own petard of emphasis on appropriate scales. The data of evo-devo accumulate and improve at such a pace that any thought of a “review article” written more than two years before anticipated publication can only be regarded as absurd. In other words, this book's timescale of production must be labeled as geological compared with a pace of discovery that can only be measured in ecological time.

I will therefore adopt the following strategy as appropriate to the circum­stance. I will exemplify the best and most informative of current empirical cases, but I ask readers to heed the following label of warning: “I wrote this section in the closing months of the last millennium. The cases discussed herein represented a 'state of the art' at this historical moment. This 'state' will be obsolete and superseded by the book's publication, but I am confident that the general themes and directions will hold and grow. Please consider the empirical discussion as exemplification, not as fulfillment.”

However, the timescale of this book also permits a luxury not afforded to authors of journal articles. For I can balance this guaranteed empirical super­annuation against a discussion of general significance that, if properly situ­ated within this book's broader subject of the history and structure of macro-evolutionary theory, may succeed in exemplifying the signal importance of evo-devo in changing and expanding our basic conception of evolutionary causality (even while I must fail to capture what the favored cliche of the mo­ment calls the “cutting edge” of actual discovery). I will therefore focus my treatment of evo-devo upon some crucial issues in the structure of evolu­tionary theory — all rooted in the concept of “constraint” in relationship to natural selection — that have frequently been overlooked, bypassed, or short­changed in the midst of immediate excitement generated by the novel data of this burgeoning field.

What features generally lead scientists to strongly shared feelings about the unusual importance of a set of discoveries? We might nominate sheer novelty as an initial, base level property — especially when enhanced by a conquest over nature's previous taunt to scientists: you know where to look in theory, but you haven't developed the proper tools for perception. (The canonical ex­ample of such rare triumphs, Galileo's Sidereus nuncius of 1610, comes inevi­tably to mind — a mere “pamphlet” that packed more oomph per paragraph than any other document in the history of printing. After all, the first tele­scopic look at a previously invisible cosmos necessarily “skimmed off” a set of magnificent and unexpected novelties, including the composition of the Milky Way as a sea of stars, the satellites of Jupiter, the phases of Venus, and the topography of the Moon.)

Much of our fascination with the data of evo-devo arises from the sheer novelty of discovery in biological domains that had been previously and to­tally inaccessible. These empirical gems also illustrate, even in these early days, the integrating power of scientific conclusions to translate a previous descriptive chaos into explanatory sensibility. As an example, consider the name given to the truly elegant theory of floral genesis, as developed by stu­dents of Arabidopsis, the “Drosophila” of angiosperm biology — the ABC Model (Coen and Meyerowitz, 1991; Weigel and Meyerowitz, 1994; Jurgens, 1997; Busch, Bomblies, and Weigel, 1999; Wagner, Sablowski, and Meyero­witz, 1999).

In this elegantly simple model (see Fig. 10-12), based on genes with homeotic effects upon serially repeated structures arranged in systematic order (with repetition in concentric whorls rather than linearly along a body axis), A genes operating alone determine the form of the outermost whorl of leaf-like sepals; A plus B genes regulate petals in the next whorl within; B plus C genes mark the male stamens, while C genes working alone determine the most interior female carpels. Moreover, leafy, a “higher control” gene previ­ously recognized as an initiator or suppressor of floral growth and placement in general (Weigel and Nilsson, 1995), apparently also regulates the more specific operation of the ABC series. (Busch et al., 1999, demonstrate that a protein produced by leafy bonds directly to a particular DNA segment of a C gene responsible for the generation of carpels.)

This model enjoys obvious significance for the full gamut of evolutionary issues, ranging from the most theoretical (in “updating” Goethe's formalist theory (see pp. 281–291) that all parts regulated by the ABC series conform to a generalized “leaf” archetype), to the most practical (hopes of florists to enhance AB interactions and grow flowers with larger and more numerous petals). But in the present context, I merely wish to highlight a linguistic point: the selected terminology of ABC surely encapsulates the accurate im­pressions (and the excitement) of researchers who recognize their role as pio­neers engaged in the construction of a basic alphabet for a new understanding of nature.

The pure discoveries of evo-devo may fit the heroic image of science as con­queror of previous ignorance (the tabula rasa model of light upon previous darkness or, literally, the first writing on a blank slate). But the most stunning of scientific novelties surely gain their status by virtue of their unexpected or surprising character — that is, their failure to match, or even their power to mock, the anticipated constitution of a part of the natural world previously





10-12. The elegant simplicity of the ABC model, from Weigel and Meyerowitz, 1994. In this model, based upon the genetics and development of Arabidopsis, the four circlets of sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels achieve their distinctive forms under the following influences, as shown in the diagram. A genes deter­mine the development of sepals; A and B petals; B and C stamens; and C alone, carpels.





inaccessible to investigation. (The most stunning property of Jupiter's four large moons, when first seen by Galileo, lay not in their mere existence, but in the recognition that their revolution about the planet would fracture the crys­talline sphere that, in the “certain” knowledge of previous views, marked Ju­piter's domain in a geocentric universe — and that such a sphere, therefore, could not exist.) In the same manner, the central significance of our dawning understanding of the genetics of development lies not in the simple discovery of something utterly unknown (the ABC floral model, or the specification of anteroposterior differentiation by arthropod Hox genes), but in the explic­itly unexpected character of these findings, and in the revisions and exten­sions thus required of evolutionary theory.

The discovery that has so discombobulated the confident expectations of orthodox theory can be stated briefly and baldly: the extensive “deep homology” now documented in both the genetic structure and developmental archi­tecture of phyla separated at least since the Cambrian explosion (ca. 530 mil­lion years ago) should not, and cannot, exist under conventional concepts of natural selection as the dominant cause of evolutionary change. Natural se­lection must therefore operate in a context of far greater constraint (in both the “negative” sense of limits upon freedom to craft particular adaptive solu­tions, and in the “positive” sense of synergism in the specification of preexist­ing or preferred internal channels) than the usual functionalist characteriza­tions of Darwinian theory envisage.

I am not trying to construct straw men or cardboard images for easy demo­lition. Of course, no good Darwinian naturalist ever conceptualized organic matter as pure putty molded by natural selection to local optimality. The hold of phenotypic homology has always fascinated evolutionary biologists and served as the basis for classification and phylogenetic reconstruction. Even the most orthodox Darwinian systematists have always recognized that “putty-like” characters — maximally labile and malleable by natural selec­tion in an unconstrained way — must be shunned in phyletic reconstruction (as sources of autapomorphic traits and manifestors of convergence), while taxonomists must base their hierarchical orderings on nested levels of homo-logical retention among related taxa.

But two classical views about homology have traditionally served to inte­grate this cardinal principle of historical constraint with a functionalist the­ory of evolutionary mechanisms. First, as previously discussed in more de­tail (pp. 251 and 1058), Darwinian biology attributes the origin of shared homologous characters to ordinary adaptation by natural selection in a com­mon ancestor. Moreover, homologous characters not only continue to ex­press their adaptive origin, but also remain fully subject to further adaptive change — even to the point of losing their ready identity as homologies — if they become inadaptive in the environment of any descendant lineage. Homological similarity in related taxa living in different environments there­fore indicates a lack of selective pressure for alteration, not a limitation upon the power of selection to generate such changes. (At the Chicago Macroevolution meeting of 1980, for example, Maynard Smith acknowledged the allometric basis of many homologies, but stated that the attribution of such simi­larity to “developmental constraint” would represent what he proposed to christen as the “Gould-Lewontin fallacy” — for natural selection can unlock any inherited developmental correlation if adaptation to immediate environ­ments favors such an alteration.)

Second, homological holds must be limited in taxonomic and structural ex­tent to close relatives of similar Bauplan and functional design. The basic ar­chitectural building blocks of life — the DNA code, or the biomolecular struc­ture of fundamental organic compounds, for example — may be widely shared by homology among phyla. But the particular blueprints of actual designs and the pathways of their construction — the form of the Gothic cathedral rather than the chemical formula of calcite in the facing stone (see pp. 1134–1142 for extensive treatment of this point) — must be limited to clades of closer relationship. The identical topology of bones in mammalian forearms of markedly different utility (the whale's flipper, the horse's leg, the bat's wing, and my typing, or literally manipulating, digits) can be homologous, but we expect no comparable hold of history upon the more generally similar segmentation of arthropod metameres and vertebrate somites (not to mention the non-homology of bones in mammalian forearms and teleost forefins).

Any wider hold of homology would have to inspire suspicions that the cen­tral tenet of orthodox Darwinism can no longer be sustained: the control of rates and directions of evolutionary change by the functional force of natural selection. In a particularly revealing quote within the greatest summary docu­ment of the Modern Synthesis, for example, Mayr (1963, p. 609) formulated the issue in a forthright manner (see p. 539 for previous discussion of this statement). After all, he argued, more than 500 million years of independent evolution must erase any extensive genetic homology among phyla if natural selection holds such power to generate favorable change. Adaptive evolution, over these long intervals, must have crafted and recrafted every genetic locus, indeed every nucleotide position, time and time again to meet the constantly changing selective requirements of continually varying environments. At this degree of cladistic separation, any independently evolved phenotypic similar­ity in basic adaptive architecture must represent the selective power of sepa­rate shaping by convergence, and cannot record the conserved influence of re­tained genetic sequences, or common generation by parallelism: “In the early days of Mendelism there was much search for homologous genes that would account for such similarities. Much that has been learned about gene physiol­ogy makes it evident that the search for homologous genes is quite futile ex­cept in very close relatives.”

But we now know that extensive genetic homology for fundamental fea­tures of development does hold across the most disparate animal phyla. For an orthodox Darwinian functionalist, only one fallback position remains via­ble in this new and undeniable light (and Ernst Mayr, vigorous as ever at age 95 as I write these words, would be the first to welcome this illumination wholeheartedly, and to laugh at his old cloudy crystal ball on this single is­sue). One can admit the high frequency and great importance of such genetic constraints (and also designate their discovery as stunningly unexpected), while continuing to claim that natural selection holds exclusive sway over evolutionary change because deep homology only imposes limits upon styles and ranges of developmental pathways, but cannot power any particular phyletic alteration. Natural selection can still reign supreme as the pool cue of actual evolutionary motion.

But a formalist defender of positive constraint will reply that such unantici­pated deep homology also channels change in positive ways — and that the key to this central argument resides in an old distinction that, unfortunately, cannot be matched for both conceptual and terminological confusion, and for consequent failure of most evolutionists to engage the issue seriously: namely, the differences in causal meaning (not just in geometric pattern) be­tween parallelism and convergence. The next section shall treat the history and logic of this issue in detail, but I shall first present the following basic for­mulation in relevant terms of balances between constraint and selection:

Even the most committed adaptationist would not deny that the indepen­dent evolution of similar phenotypic features (in both form and function) in two closely related lineages may be facilitated by the presence, in both ances­tors, of the same genes and developmental pathways inherited from a recent common ancestor. (The independently evolved features of these two lineages cannot be called homologous on basic definitional grounds, but the features may still be built by homologous genes and along homologous developmental pathways.)

For example, no adaptationist would be fazed by the suggestion that rela­tive increase in antler size within two separate cervid lineages undergoing phyletic increase in body size occurred because both lineages retained an an­cestral allometry that may well be homologically pervasive within the Cervidae (Huxley, 1932, for this classic case of positive allometry). Inherited constraint may set a preferred channel, but selection must still guide any lin­eage into such an internally biased path. So a functionalist may view such un­deniably positive constraints as, at most, helpmeets or facilitators of natural selection, while continuing to regard selection as a necessary instigator, and therefore as the primary cause of change.

But — and now we come to the nub of the issue, and to the central role of positive developmental constraint as a major challenge to selectionist ortho­doxy — the attribution of similar evolutionary changes in independent lin­eages to internal constraint of homologous genes and developmental path­ways, and not only to an external impetus of common selective pressures, must be limited to very close relatives still capable of maintaining substantial genetic identity as a consequence of recent common ancestry. Mayr's charac­terization of selectionist orthodoxy comes again to mind: distantly related lineages cannot be subject to such internal limitation or channeling because the pervasive scrutiny and ruthless efficiency of natural selection, operating on every feature over countless generations in geological immensity, must have fractured any homological hold by underlying genes and developmental pathways over the freedom of phenotypes to follow wherever selection leads. Darwin's famous words, so often quoted, haunt the background of this dis­cussion (1859, p. 84): “It may be said that natural selection is daily and hourly scrutinising, throughout the world, every variation, even the slightest; rejecting that which is bad, preserving and adding up all that is good; silently and insensibly working, whenever and wherever opportunity offers, at the improvement of each organic being in relation to its organic and inorganic conditions of life.”

Therefore, any uncannily detailed phenotypic similarity evolved between distantly related groups must arise by convergence from substrates of nonhomologous genotypes — thus affirming our usual view of selection's over­arching power, especially if common function for the two similar forms can validate the hypothesis of generation within a comparable adaptational ma­trix. (Note the logical danger of circularity that intrudes upon the argument at this point, for this extent of detailed similarity — the very datum that, in an unbiased approach, would lead one to entertain parallelism based upon com­mon internal constraint as a viable alternative to convergence based on simi­lar adaptive needs — now becomes an a priori affirmation of selection's power, the hypothesis supposedly under test.)

For this reason, such detailed functional and structural similarities, evolved independently in distantly related lineages, have become “poster boy” exam­ples of convergence — itself the “poster boy” phenomenon and general con­cept for showcasing selection's dominant sway — precisely because similarities evolved in this mode cannot, by Mayr's argument, be ascribed to parallelism based on positive constraint imposed by homologous genetic and develop­mental pathways. With internal channeling thus theoretically barred as a po­tential source of impressive similarity, convergence becomes the favored ex­planation by default. The argument, surely “tight” in logic and principle, seems incontrovertible.

Since I do not wish to dwell on the previous errors that we all committed on this issue, let me simply illustrate the older view, and the magnitude of cur­rent reversal, with one of my own mistakes — from a 1976 paper extolling convergence as evolutionary biology's closest natural analog to replication in the experimental sciences (Gould, 1976, p. 177):

The convergent evolution of similar structures fulfills, at least imper­fectly, the criterion of independent replication that any experiment re­quires. An adequate theory of functional morphology must explain adaptive design by studying how different organisms react to the same selective regime. If we want to know whether plate tectonics is a true, universal physics of large bodies or only a descriptive account of this planet's history, other planets must be studied. If we want to know whether the biochemical unities of all life on earth have general import as optimal designs (given the nature of universal chemistry) or merely re­flect the monophyletic origin of life on earth (and the homologous status of ATP and left-handed amino acids), then we shall have to hope for life on Mars. If, to retreat to something more immediate, one wishes to assess the functional limits or mechanical constraint upon the human eye, one would do well — as J. Z. Young and others have done — to study the octopus.



But, as I shall discuss on pp. 1123–1132, one of the major discoveries of evo-devo has revealed a deep genetic homology underlying and promot­ing the separate evolution of lens eyes in cephalopods and vertebrates. The overt phenotypes do record substantial convergence (for different body tis­sues build corresponding structures in the two groups), but both phyla share key underlying genes and developmental pathways as homologies, and the example has lost its former status as the principal textbook case of natural se­lection's power to craft stunning similarities from utterly disparate raw mate­rials. Eyes of such strikingly similar design owe their independent origin as much to genetic and developmental parallelism, based on internal constraints of homologous genes and developmental pathways, as to selection's capacity for iterating nearly identical adaptations from scratch by convergence.

With this “one liner” of maximal force — evo-devo has reinterpreted several textbook examples of convergence as consequences of substantial parallel­ism — we can encapsulate the depth of theoretical disturbance introduced by this subject into the heart of Darwinian theory. Our former best examples of full efficacy for the functional force of natural selection only exist because in­ternal constraints of homologous genes and developmental pathways have kept fruitful channels of change open and parallel, even in the most disparate and most genealogically distant bilaterian phyla. The homological hold of historical constraint channels change at all levels, even for the broadest pat­terning of morphospace, and not only for details of parallel evolution in very closely related groups.





A terminological excursis on the meaning of parallelism




THE NINE FATEFUL LITTLE WORDS OF E. RAY LANKESTER. The transforming power of this discovery upon evolutionary theory would stand out more clearly if the key terms and concepts had not become so muddled in our literature, and therefore so widely misunderstood or disregarded by modern researchers. (This situation cannot validate the graybeard's perennial lament: “them young fellers just don't keep up with the views of the older guys, like we did when we wuz gettin' started.” The concepts and terminology sur­rounding the origin and status of similar structures in different lineages have inspired particular difficulty and unclear thinking ever since Darwin, and even before. In their classic paper on the subject, still the best treatment ever published, Haas and Simpson (1946) devoted the bulk of their long text to the history of confusion over differences between parallelism and convergence — with the two authors finally agreeing to disagree about the most fruitful definitions, even as they resolved the conceptual confusions.)

We should begin by recalling a central distinction that we all know, and probably all regard as refreshingly free from conceptual ambiguity: the differ­ence between homology and homoplasy. Homologous structures are similar by inheritance from a common ancestor. Homoplastic structures are simi­lar by independent evolution, for we can infer that the common ancestor did not possess the structure. In other words, the dichotomy of these two terms captures the essential difference between common ancestry and independent origin. At a first level of interpretation (but here we immediately plunge a toe into troubled waters, as we shall soon see), the dichotomy also marks a conceptual distinction between the hold of history and the power of adap­tation.

So far so good — and I will not challenge the accepted and codified current definition of these two terms for describing an important logical distinction in evolutionary biology. But we often gain better understanding — and do not merely indulge an antiquarian passion for trivial and superannuated detail — when we explore the historical origin of a word, and then discover a marked discrepancy between initial and current usage. I intend no criticism of current usage in making such an observation. Words change their meanings, just as organisms evolve. We would impose an enormous burden upon our economy if we insisted upon payment in cattle every time we identified a bonus as a pe­cuniary advantage (from the Latin pecus, or cattle, a verbal fossil from a for­mer commercial reality).

E. Ray Lankester, T. H. Huxley's protege and the finest evolutionary morphologist in the generation just after Darwin, proposed the concept of homoplasy in 1870 (see Lester and Bowler, 1995, and Gould, 1999a, on Lankester's life and general views). I suspect that most evolutionary biologists could cite Lankester as a source, but I will wager a substantial sum that very few colleagues could identify (to their pecuniary benefit) a supreme irony in Lankester's original paper, entitled “On the use of the term homology in modern zoology, and the distinction between homogenetic and homoplas­tic agreements” — namely, that he defined homoplasy as a subcategory of homology, in apparent defiance of current usage (which, I repeat, I do not challenge) of homology and homoplasy as dichotomous opposites. The rea­sons for his distinctions, and for subsequent changes and refinements of meaning, tell an interesting story that can unlock the essential distinction between parallelism and convergence, and also explain the significance of evo-devo in unleashing the capacity of parallelism to rebalance formalist and functionalist causes within evolutionary theory.

Richard Owen enjoyed the height of his influence when Lankester wrote his paper, and the younger morphologist properly went to the source of all later usage (Owen, 1848 and 1849) in defining his terms. Lankester, as a Dar­winian acolyte, also correctly noted the philosophical difficulty facing anyone who sought to translate such vital terms as homology into the new evolution­ary context. Owen, as Lankester notes, defined homology within a Platonic theory of archetypal form (see discussion of Owen's concepts on pp. 312–329). How can the term be carried over into Darwin's world? Lankester (1870, p. 34) began his paper by stating this problem:

Whilst the adoption of the theory of evolution has broken down the no­tions at one time held by zoologists and botanists as to the existence of more or less symmetrical classes and groups in the organic world, estab­lished by some inherent law of Nature which limited her productive powers to arbitrary special plans or types of structure, and has taught us to see, in the variously isolated and variously connected kinds of animals and plants, simply the parts of one great genealogical tree, which have become detached and separated from one another in a thousand differ­ent degrees, through the operation of the great destroyer Time, yet certain terms and ideas are still in use which belonged to the old Platonic school, and have not been defined afresh in accordance with the doctrine of descent.



In particular, Owen had specified three categories of homology: special, general, and serial. (His classical and definitive 1848 treatise, “On the arche­type and homologies of the vertebrate skeleton,” comprises three chapters, ti­tled “special homology,” “general homology,” and “serial homology” respec­tively.)

Owen's famously vague and broad definition of “homologue” as “the same organ in different animals under every variety of form and function” (1848, p. 7, repeated from 1843, p. 374) invokes a Platonic notion of sameness as “proceeding from a common archetype.” Lankester had the good sense and vision to recognize (and we continue to assent today) that this concept did enjoy philosophical coherence, and could be translated into evolutionary terms — but that the Darwinian version implied different distinctions, requir­ing a subdivision of meanings and significances within a general notion that remained usefully unitary.

Owen's three categories share tighter bonding in the idea that parts can be called homologous so long as they can be construed as expressions or em­bodiments of the same idealized archetype (a key pre-evolutionary notion of formalist, as opposed to functionalist, thinking, and therefore particularly difficult to translate into a functionalist theory of evolution like natural selec­tion). Obviously, as a first pass for evolutionary translation, we should rede­fine the Owenian archetype as the Darwinian common ancestor — thus substi­tuting the real flesh and blood of physical continuity for a Platonic notion of formal identity. We can then proceed, as Lankester notes, with evolutionary versions of Owen's three categories.

For Owen (1848, p. 7), special homology refers to “the correspondence of a part or organ, determined by its relative position and connections, with a part or organ in a different animal.” In evolutionary terms, we regard these two parts (in two different organisms) as homologous because they descend from the same feature in a common ancestor. Lankester (1870, p. 36, first paragraph) recognized this criterion of common ancestry as paramount — the definition that “without doubt the majority of evolutionists” would assign to the concept of homology. Lankester proposed — although his name never took hold — that this aspect of Owen's broader concept (“special homology”) be called homogeny (or homology sensu stricto.) What then becomes of Owen's other two categories?

Owen defined general homology as “a higher relation ... in which a part or series of parts stands to the fundamental or general type, and its enuncia­tion involves and implies a knowledge of the type on which a natural group of animals, the vertebrate for example, is constructed” (1848, p. 7). This idea that we can assert a form of homology between two parts (in two organ­isms) because both express the same general archetype, rather than because one part can be designated as the “same” as the other part (as in special homology), does not translate by a similar criterion of descent from common ancestry because, as Owen noted, general homology records “a higher rela­tion.” For example, Owen regarded arms, legs, and heads for that matter, as derivations from a common vertebral archetype. Thus, the forearm of an aardvark is a general homolog of my leg (not to mention the shrew's head and the whale's flipper).

Obviously, these pairings do not represent homology by direct descent from common ancestry. And yet, we would not deny that some legitimate evolutionary commonality links my leg and aardvark's forearm (forget the shrew's head, although I would not be shocked if the old vertebral theory for the origin of the skull reemerges some day in a renewed form of validity). Moreover, we can be quite confident that the similarity marks a genuine his­torical hold, not a fortuity, or a convergence separately evolved from different archetypal bases. Still, the hold cannot be equated with true common ances­try, and must arise instead as a constraint based on common genesis from a source that imposes limitations or sets preferred channels of change from within. In his Platonic perspective, Owen called this common source an ar­chetype. We would identify such a generating source as a developmental con­straint from the historical vertex of the aptive triangle — perhaps arising from homologous genes or homologous developmental pathways in the two sepa­rated lineages.

Finally, Owen defined serial homology as the iteration of an archetypal form within the same organism in a set of repeated parts, perhaps each spe­cialized for a particular function, but still bearing signs of the common archi­tectural plan — as in the biramous appendages of arthropods, whether special­ized as antennae, mouth parts, walking legs or genital claspers; and in the arms and legs of tetrapods.

When asked how he could square serial homology with his basic defini­tion of “the same organ in different animals...” Owen would reply that the criterion of sameness trumped the requirement for different organisms, and that different places within the same organism would suffice. And we do not judge this response today as flippant or invalid because we share Owen's feeling that some common principle — although not common ancestry — vali­dates a legitimate comparison of my leg and the aardvark's forearm (general homology) and the aardvark's forearm with the aardvark's own leg (serial homology). We would also identify this common principle as developmen­tal constraint based on homologous genes and embryological pathways (whether expressed as arms and legs in the same animal, or as similar struc­tures in two animals — although we would call such structures nonhomologous because they do not descend from a common ancestor, even though they owe their structural similarity, in large part, to construction by homologous genes and developmental pathways. After all, if no common genetics or devel­opment influenced the ontogeny of the aardvark's arm and leg, we would view the two limbs as purely convergent and unaffected by internal con­straint, while Owen, in such circumstances, would not have defined them as serially homologous).

We may now return to Lankester's problem: Owen's special homology translates easily into evolutionary language as descent from common ances­try. This phenomenon presents no conceptual problem, and Lankester there­fore chose to separate this subcategory as the unambiguous “best case” of homogeny. But how shall general and special homology be represented in evolutionary language? On the one hand, Owen applied these terms to sepa­rate structures that do not descend from the same structure in a common ancestor. They should therefore be distinguished from special homology (Lankester's homogeny) because we must be able to identify true and unbro­ken continuity in physical descent as a basis for phylogenetic reconstruction.

On the other hand, general and serial homologies do record a hold of history over descent within clades. Some common property, present in a clade as a consequence of phylogenetic history, does generate the similarities in these two other Owenian categories. But this property can only be identified as a common generating pattern, a common constraint, a common pathway of development, or a common set of hereditary tendencies — and explicitly not as an overt common ancestral structure retained by descent in subsequent branches of the clade.

What then shall we call these products of common phylogenetic patterns in organic architecture — these separately evolved results of common develop­mental constraints, we would say today — but not of overt and expressed common ancestral phenotypes? Lankester proposed that we call them homoplasts in contrast with the homogens of common structural origin, and that we designate the process of their production as homoplasy, as distinguished from the homogeny of strict descent from common ancestral structures. But he considered both processes as subdivisions of a larger and coherent concept of homology — homogeny for Owen's special homology, and homoplasy for Owen's general and serial homology.

In defending his placement of homoplasy within a broad but coherent con­cept of homology, Lankester asks (1870, p. 38): “What is the other quantity covered by the term homology over and above homogeny?” Lankester an­swers that many similarities not due to inheritance of common ancestral structures nonetheless arise as consequences of the inheritance of unique phylogenetically constrained building patterns — and therefore deserve inclu­sion within a broader category of similarity based upon descent (as opposed to similarity derived purely by independent adaptation, with no contribution by constraint from an organism's past history). These independently evolved, but historically constrained, similarities — we would now call them parallel­isms — define Lankester's original concept of homoplasy. Lankester does acknowledge that homoplastic similarities must be evoked by similar environmental pressures (the pool cue of natural selection, in Darwinian terms), but he stresses the internal basis of inherited common building patterns and ma­terials (1870, p. 42): “Under the term 'homology,' belonging to another phi­losophy, evolutionists have described and do describe two kinds of agree­ment — the one, now proposed to be called 'homogeny,' depending simply on the inheritance of a common part, the other, proposed to be called 'homoplasy,' depending on a common action of evoking causes or moulding envi­ronment on such homogenous parts, or on parts which for other reasons of­fer a likeness of material to begin with.”

The foregoing exegesis raises an obvious question: if Lankester restricted homoplasy to independent origin of similar features based on common and phyletically distinctive internal constraints (though not common ancestral structures) in two or more lineages — thus drawing the phenomenon close enough to the essential and defining theme of homology (the “hold of his­tory”) to rank, in Lankester's system, as a subcategory of homology (broadly defined) — then how did the term migrate to the opposite meaning now uni­versally and unambiguously understood today? In other words, how did homoplasy move from a subcategory of homology to become the diametric opposite of homology, with the domain of homology then shrinking to en­compass only Lankester's narrower category of homogeny, and the domain of homoplasy expanding to include all similarities evolved independently and not directly inherited from a common ancestral structure?

What looks like an enormous difference — the expulsion of homoplasy as a subcategory of homology (sensu lato), and its establishment as a phe­nomenon directly contrary to homology (sensu stricto) — actually rests upon a small point: the migration of convergence into the category of homoplasy as now defined. If we decide that the crucial distinction between homology and homoplasy should rest upon common ancestry vs. independent origin, then one important phenomenon, necessarily included within homoplasy by the defining criterion of independent origin for similar structures, shares too much conceptual overlap with homology to permit a clear and comfortable theoretical separation (however firm the descriptive division): independent origin channeled by common internal constraints of homologous genes or developmental pathways — in other words, the phenomenon known as paral­lelism.

But Lankester originally defined homoplasy exclusively on the basis of phenomena that we would attribute to parallelism (Owen's general and serial homologies). Therefore, for him, homoplasy could legitimately count as a subcategory of homology (sensu lato), even though he recognized that he had to separate homoplasy from homogeny (homology sensu stricto) by the gene­alogical criterion of common ancestry vs. independent origin. But, if the scope of homoplasy ever expanded to embrace convergences as well — a defendable move because convergences also record an independent origin of similarities — then the combination of parallelisms plus convergences into one category would destroy the conceptual linkage of homoplasy with homol­ogy. With the addition of convergence (based on explicit denial of common internal constraints, and exclusive focus on a common external context of adaptation), homoplasy loses its former common ground with homology (in positing historical hold — whether of structures in homogeny, or of genes, pathways and potential in homoplasy — as the shared causal basis of similar structures in two lineages). Moreover, this expanded category of homoplasy now includes only one universal feature to define its own coherence: indepen­dent origin, in both parallelism and convergence. This feature also places homoplasy into antithesis with homology (common ancestry vs. independent origin).

Convergence did join parallelism to build an expanded category of ho­moplasy, thus setting the opposition that continues to define these terms as an exhaustive and dichotomous division today. Ironically, as a final point, Lankester himself — in a logical inconsistency within his own paper — spawned this dramatic shift in his own intended parsings by adding those “nine fateful little words” (of my title to this subsection) to the end of one statement in his original article. On page 41, as he tries to distinguish his newly formulated concept of homoplasy from the older notion of analogy, he presents (in this single passage) such a broad definition of homoplasy (in the midst of a “generous” attempt to show that analogy must be construed as broader still, and therefore not synonymous with homoplasy no matter how far we extend the concept) that he actually includes independent evolution by convergence — not a subcategory of homology by any stretch of the imagina­tion! — in those nine words at the end (presented in italics below, but not in Lankester's original): “Homoplasy includes all cases of close resemblances of form which are not traceable to homogeny, all details of agreement not ho­mogenous, in structures which are broadly homogenous, as well as in struc­tures having no genetic affinity.”

Once pure convergence had been added to homoplasy via these nine fateful little words, the linkage of homoplasy to homology could no longer be de­fended — and the two concepts moved from their initial union to their current antithesis.

I recount this story at some length because I know no better way to illus­trate the central tension and conceptual confusion within the concept of homoplasy. Parallelism and convergence do share the common descriptive feature of defining an independent origin for similar structures in two lin­eages. But in causal terms, particularly for assessing the relative weights of formal vs. functional factors in evolutionary change, the conceptual differ­ence could not be more important — for parallelism marks the formal influ­ence of internal constraint, while convergence reflects the functional opera­tion of natural selection upon two substrates different enough to exclude internal factors as influences upon the resulting similarity.

This recognition of internal channeling as the root cause of parallelism — the principal basis for ascribing evolutionary change, and not only limitation, to historical constraint — lies at the heart of evo-devo's theoretical novelty and importance to the Darwinian worldview. This context behooves us to formu­late, and to clarify, the causal distinction between parallelism and convergence — and not just to lump these two principles together by their single common property of specifying an independent origin for similar features in separate lineages. I believe that the history and logic of debate about the meaning of parallelism provide our best path to understanding this important revision in evolutionary theory.





THE TERMINOLOGICAL ORIGIN AND DEBATE ABOUT THE MEANING AND UTILITY OF PARALLELISM. After struggling through dense para­graphs and conceptual thickets, G. G. Simpson (in Haas and Simpson, 1946, p. 325) finally conceded that traditional confusion about the evolutionary meaning of similarity rested upon a logical dilemma, not an absence of empir­ical data for resolution of a factual issue. Why, to state the dilemma suc­cinctly, does parallelism resist easy fitting into a coherent conceptual structure for the terminology of evolutionary similarity? In particular, why, when par­allelism comfortably joins convergence to establish a coherent larger cate­gory (called homoplasy) for similar structures evolved independently, have so many good biologists, from the first formulation of the concept until today, continued to “feel in their bones” that something about parallelism veers off towards the supposedly opposite category of homology? Why, to use a ver­nacular expression often invoked in this discussion (as by Patterson, 1988), does parallelism seem to occupy a “gray zone” between the clear homology of evident retention by common descent, and the clear homoplasy of conver­gence by selective production of strikingly similar structures (in both form and function) from entirely different points of origin (the “cup coral” shape of rudistid bivalves, prorichthofeniid brachiopods and rugosan corals, for example)?

I have used Simpson's insight to construct the enlarged chart presented as Table 10-1. In an incisive footnote, explicating his differences with coauthor Otto Haas, Simpson makes the logical point that, although homology and homoplasy do cohere as dichotomous opposites encompassing all cases, they bear to each other the odd relationship of a positive claim (A) contrasted with an absence thereof (not-A). Nothing in logic forbids such a taxonomy, but scientists, maintaining a deeply engrained (if unconscious) preference for classification by causes, feel discomfited, in a way that they may not even be able to articulate, about a scheme that contrasts a positive assertion (homol­ogy as descent from common ancestry) with its descriptive absence (homo­plasy as similarity not by descent from the same structure in a common an­cestor). Simpson wrote (in Haas and Simpson, 1946, p. 325):

Homology, as we agree, is best defined as similarity interpreted as due to common ancestry. Homoplasy, as we also agree, is best defined as simi­larity (or as including any process leading to similarity) that is not explic­itly interpreted as due to common ancestry. Both terms rather than being purely descriptive . . . express an opinion, one positive and one negative. Homology expresses an opinion as to how the similarity arose. Homoplasy expresses an opinion as to how the similarity did not arise, i.e., that it did not arise by homology, but it does not express an opinion as to how the similarity did arise. I do not... see these as alternatives at the same categorical level. The set is not positive, “a” and “b” as mutually exclusive categories, but is a dichotomy of “a” and “not-a.” Under “not-a” it is still possible to have a sequence of alternatives, such as “b,” “c,” etc., that are positive categories on the same level as “a.”



The standard literature does include a venerable term — analogy — that might establish a contrast with homology in the causal sense that wins our almost visceral assent as more satisfactory, with homology as positive A (sim­ilarity due to common descent, with no need to invoke direct selective mold­ing), and analogy as oppositely positive B (similarity due to common pres­sures of natural selection upon backgrounds of no common descent).

We now encounter the logical dilemma that underlies nearly all our exten­sive and lamentable confusion on this issue. Homoplasy and analogy might strike us, at first, as fully synonymous, for both invoke natural selection as the source of separate evolution for similar structures in two lineages. This synonymy certainly applies for convergence. But homoplasy comes in two flavors: parallelism and convergence — with parallelism as the historical root (in Lankester's original definition of homoplasy), but only convergence carry­ing the full flavor of synonymy. That is, convergence stands opposite to homology by both criteria — the negative not-A of origin not by common de­scent, and the positive B of origin by natural selection working in a similar way upon two unrelated substrates.

Unfortunately, a common error of human thinking leads us to define broad and variable categories by their clearest extreme cases. Thus, many scientists have assumed that all homoplasy, whether by parallelism or by convergence, must originate entirely for functional reasons, and not at all by constraint (the B category of exclusively dichotomous logic); whereas, the “not-A” of independent origin identifies the only property truly required for inclusion within the broad definition of homoplasy. Simpson continues (in Simpson and Haas, 1946, ibid.):

Moreover, the implication is usually present to some degree and it has sometimes been explicitly stated that the structural similarity here in question is not due to homology but is correlated with community of function as opposed to community of ancestry. It is in this sense that analogy is a true alternative (but not the only alternative) to homology as a positive category on the same level, a “b” category rather than a “not-a” category or something on a different level altogether. That is, analogy, when used in this way, expresses a positive opinion, or theory, that a structural resemblance is correlated with function, just as homol­ogy expresses the view that it is correlated with common ancestry. Unlike homoplasy, analogy offers an alternative theory as to the basis of the re­semblance in question.



The flavor of parallelism, however, lies in the gray zone of the A-B type classification that our traditions favor (see Table 10-1). In a descriptive sense, parallelism surely ranks within not-A by definition. But when we assess paral­lelism's relationship to the B category of our alternative scheme, we run right into the aforementioned logical conundrum. Parallelism partakes of B in its invocation of similar selective regimes to produce homoplastic structures from two separate starting points lacking the structure. But parallelism also includes too much A-ness (that is, claims for genuine homology of some sort) to rank as pure B.

The logical solution, had the issue been properly formulated, is not, and never has been, particularly arcane or difficult. Parallelism lies in a gray zone as a consequence of its different status within two conceptual schemes that do not parse nature in exactly the same way, but that we tend to conflate (be­cause both capture important properties of phyletic change) when we con­sider the meaning of similarity in evolution. Parallelism includes aspects of both constraint and independent selection — not as a wishy-washy mixture in one grand pluralistic glop of all-things-for-all-people, but in rigorously differ­ent parsings for different levels of consideration (again, as evident in Table 10-1. Several authors have stressed the dependency of these terms on the hierarchical

level under consideration — see Roth, 1991; Wagner, 1989; Bolker and Raff, 1996. Wing of bats and birds are, after all, convergent as wings, but homologous as forearms).

At the level of an overt phenotypic structure under explicit consideration, parallelism denies homology and asserts independent origin. But, at the level of the generators for the overt feature — the genes regulating its architecture, and the developmental pathways defining its construction — parallelism af­firms homology as the concept's fundamental meaning and raison d'etre, and the basis for its dichotomous contrast with convergence as alternatives within the more inclusive category of homoplasy. Thus, parallelism does require in­dependent regimes of similar selection, but the resulting phenotypic like­nesses must also be channeled from within by homologous generators.

(In an odd sense, one might view this old issue of differences between parallelism and convergence as a grand foreshadowing for an important debate that evolutionary biologists have only recently clarified in their minds — but that might have achieved earlier resolution had we all remembered this older discussion: the recognition that cladistic gene-trees do not correspond en­tirely with organism-trees. The capacity for parallelism rests upon organismal branching before gene branching. Continuing the argument, one might also view the first steps in the opposite mode of gene branching before organism branching as a molecular representation of Owen's old concept of serial homology. Paralogs within one organism are serial homologs; different paralogs in two organisms are general homologs; only orthologs in two organisms are special homologs, the heart of the modern concept of pure homology, or Lankester's homogeny — see p. 1071.)

Framed this way, the maddening complexities and counterclaims of the literature gain immediate clarification. One must then ask why the distinc­tion between parallelism and convergence has bred so much conceptual trou­ble in the past. In particular, the two terms have often been purposefully combined (and demoted) to merely descriptive names for stages in a contin­uum. The terms will then only designate the trivial geometric difference be­tween features evolved independently in two lines that remain at about the same distance in overall phenotype (parallelism) and lineages that become more similar as a consequence of their separate evolution of such functionally comparable features (convergence). One can only wonder, then, why biolo­gists ever bothered to devise explicit terms for mere geometric waystations in a continuum with no interesting causal distinctions. Yet Haas, for example, defended this descriptive and geometric meaning, while his coauthor G. G. Simpson demurred (in Haas and Simpson, 1946). And Willey (1911), in a first book entirely dedicated to the subject (and title) of “Convergence in Evolution,” also denied a meaningful distinction in choosing his single term to encompass the entire subject of separately evolved similarities. Willey wrote (1911, p. xi): “I have used the word convergence in a wide sense ... The [tra­ditional] definitions leave us in the dark as to what degrees of relationship would entitle a given case to be classed as one of parallelism or of conver­gence.”

In my judgment, Wake (1991, pp. 543-544) has correctly explained why many biologists blurred the theoretical difference between parallelism and convergence, and then relegated the terms to descriptive waystations in a con­tinuum of results for a single causal process. When the subject of internal constraint faded to a periphery of interest (or even of active denial) within the functionalist orthodoxy of selection's overarching power and adaptation's empirical preeminence at the height of the Modern Synthesis (see Chapter 7 on hardline versions of the Synthesis that peaked in the late 1950's and 1960's), the conceptual distinction of parallelism as a manifestation of inter­nal channeling became uninteresting to most evolutionists (or, in the worst ef­fects of biasing by restrictive theories, even unperceivable). With the defining feature of parallelism thus banished to a limbo of theoretical irrelevance, biologists limited their concern to the support provided for adaptationist pref­erences by the common feature of all homoplasies: the guiding power of inde­pendent selective regimes, whether aided by homologous internal channels (parallelism) or not (convergence), to fashion the same functional result in separate lineages. Wake wrote (1991, pp. 543-544):

My central theme is the phenomenon of nondivergent evolutionary change among lineages, including convergent morphological evolution, parallelism, and some kinds of reversal — in other words, what phylogeneticists term homoplasy . . . Convergence and parallelism often are considered to constitute strong evidence of the functioning of natural se­lection. Patterson stated, “The general explanation for convergence is functional adaptation to similar environments” (1988, pp. 616-17), but I argue that alternatives must always be considered. In recent years in­creasing attention has been given to the possibility that parallelism is a manifestation of internal design constraints, and so both functionalist and structuralist constructs predict its occurrence.



As Wake's statement implies, two reasons — one “good” and the other “bad” in the conventional, if simplistic, terms, usually applied to such assess­ments in science — underlie this movement of parallelism to a periphery of limited interest, or to conflation with convergence, a phenomenon of oppo­site theoretical import in judging the differential weights of constraint and adaptation in the origin of homoplastic similarities. Wake correctly identifies the “bad” reason, as an overemphasis on functionalist themes that limited the scope of evolutionary theory during the mid-century's height of enthusiasm for a “hardened” version of the “Modern Synthesis.” Phenomena like paral­lelism, defined by components of internal constraint, did not elicit the atten­tion of many evolutionists during this period.

But, as Wake recognizes in the last sentence of his statement, parallelism also received limited attention for the eminently “good” reason that, however well defined in a conceptual sense, the crucial distinction between parallel­ism and convergence could not be cashed out in operational terms until recently — for biologists could not identify the “homologies of underlying generators” (the shared genetic and developmental bases of independently evolved structures) needed to distinguish parallelism from the purely adaptational phenomenon of convergence. But evo-devo has become an active field, while the subject of parallelism has been catapulted from a periphery of forced inattention (as a clearly defined but non-operational concept) into the center of evolutionary studies, largely because biologists have now developed criteria for distinguishing the internal constraints of parallelism from the purely selective basis of convergence.

In short, more than a century after recognizing the important concep­tual distinction, we can finally resolve actual cases by assessing the different contributions to homoplastic similarity made by constraining channels based on homologous generators and directing pathways based on common re­gimes of selection. I shall present the evidence of best cases in the next sec­tion, but will first close this section on conceptual and terminological analysis by citing five chronological episodes in the history of evolutionary debate about parallelism. These linked episodes all exemplify a crucial argument about the importance to general evolutionary theory of current research on the genetics of development: Despite all subsequent confusion and denigra­tion, the concept of parallelism arose as a causal claim about channels of con­straint vs. purely functionalist explanations rooted in natural selection (or some other adaptationist mechanism, as NeoLamarckism remained popular in the early years of this debate) for the evolution of homoplastic resem­blance.

The interesting literature on parallelism (as opposed to some of the mean­ingless wrangling over terminology) never lost this theoretical context throughout a century of research and commentary. The delay in resolution, and the prolongation of theoretical discussion, did not reflect any lack of clar­ity on the part of evolutionists, especially as explicated by G. G. Simpson, who understood and promoted the concept of parallelism and its potentially radical implications for Darwinian theory. Rather, the persisting frustration about parallelism primarily recorded the inability of geneticists and develop­mental biologists to identify the generators posited as the basis of “latent” or “underlying” homology in the evolution of homoplastic structures deemed parallel rather than convergent. This bolted door of stymied practice has now been unlocked, and we have crossed a threshold into a period of amazingly fruitful research on parallelism in particular, and on the role of developmen­tal constraint based on deep homology in general, for establishing the mark­edly nonrandom clumping of actual organisms within life's potential morphospace.

The origin of the term “parallelism.” Interestingly, this term first entered evolutionary theory with an entirely different meaning — but for another concept, indeed a far stronger version, of internal channels as major determinants of trends in the history of life: the theory of recapitulation in embryology. In preevolutionary versions, Agassiz had spoken of a “three­fold parallel” of embryological, taxonomic, and paleontological series within larger types. The American paleontologist and evolutionary theorist E. D. Cooe then formalized an evolutionary version of the “law of parallelism” within recapitulatory theory (see Gould, 1977b, for relevant sources and quotations).

“The relation of genera,” Cope writes (1887, p. 45), “which are simply steps in one and the same line of development, may be called exact parallel­ism.” In other words, different genera belonging to the same parallel series will run, during their full ontogenies, down varying lengths of a common de­velopmental (and phyletic) trackway. In this sense, the adult of one genus may be virtually identical (exactly parallel in Cope's terms) with the juvenile form of another genus that runs further along the common track during its own ontogeny. Obviously, these common trackways, regulating both the on­togeny and phylogeny of entire series of related genera, invoke a concept of internal constraint with a vengeance. Cope, in this early version of his devel­oping ideas, placed far more stress on internal channeling to explain taxonomic relationships than his later attraction for the functionalist theory of Neo-Lamarckism would allow (see Gould, 1977b and 1981b, for an analysis of Cope's changing views on the relative importance of constraint and func­tion).

The first use of parallelism in its modern meaning, including its dichotomous pairing with convergence, can also be traced to two of the greatest American vertebrate paleontologists of the late 19th century: W. B. Scott and H. F. Osborn. If the concept can claim a “founding” quotation at all, Scott (1891, p. 362), in a long and famous article on the osteology of early perissodactyls and artiodactyls, invoked degree of taxonomic relationship to distin­guish parallelism from convergence, while emphasizing their common attrib­utes as homoplastic confounders of phylogeny: “But if the various species of the ancestral genus may acquire the new character independently of each other (parallelism), or if the species of widely different genera may gradually assume a common likeness (convergence), then it is plain that such a genus is an artificial assemblage of forms of polyphyletic origin.”

In his 1895 summer lecture at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Scott (1896, p. 56) provided a more formal definition: “By parallelism is meant the independent acquisition of similar structure in forms which are themselves nearly related, and by convergence such acquisition in forms which are not closely related, and thus in one or more respects come to be more nearly alike than were their ancestors.”

More importantly, Scott then explicitly argued that he needed to distin­guish these two categories of homoplasy because parallelism, based on con­straints of inherited channels for preferred change, will generally confound phylogeny less than convergences that arise by similar functional impact upon truly different starting points (1896, p. 58): “It seems the most obvious of commonplaces to say that numerous and close resemblances of structure are prima facie evidences of relationship. Yet the statement is true, even though the resemblances have been independently acquired, because parallel­ism is a more frequently observed phenomenon than convergence, and be­cause the more nearly related any two organisms are, the more likely are they to undergo similar modifications.”

Osborn, the patrician “kingmaker” of American paleontology (and quite a potentate in American science in general), cited Scott's definitions in several papers, paying special attention — in the context of his own pluralistic views on the importance of both formal and functional factors as evolutionary causes — to the role of parallelism in combining the push of selection (or some other functionalist cause) with the internal channeling of constraint as the architect of preferred pathways for any agent of “pushing.” For example, in his 1902 paper on “Homoplasy as a law of latent or potential homology,” Osborn had already identified parallelism as falling into a gray zone between the pure analogy of convergence and the pure homology of unaltered in­heritance. With parallelism's notion of “predeterminate variation” (1902, p. 270), Osborn argues, “I think we have to deal with homology or, more strictly, with a principle intermediate between homology and analogy.”

In a 1905 article on “The ideas and terms of modern philosophical anat­omy,” Osborn then presented a first chart (reproduced here as Fig. 10-13) of relations among these terms, including parallelism and convergence as sub-categories of analogous resemblance (in contrast with homologous resem­blance here restricted to Lankester's notion of homogeny). His chart depicts the geometrical distinction between parallelism and convergence, but his de­finitions follow Scott in relying not on the descriptive difference between par­allel and converging lines, but on “similar characters arising independently in similar or related animals or organs” for parallelism, vs. “similar adaptations arising independently in dissimilar or unrelated animals or organs” for con­vergence.

These foundational statements indicate both the conceptual clarity and the

nonoperational nature — about the most frustrating situation one can face in science — of the distinction originally made in defining parallelism and convergence. Both Scott and Osborn grasped the importance of separating homoplasy due to underlying homology of generators (“latent or potential homology” in Osborn's apt phrase in the title of his 1902 paper) from homo­plasy rooted exclusively in a similar external context of adaptation. But the biology of their time provided no way to specify or identify these generators. Scott and Osborn therefore had to invoke the entirely unsatisfactory, indirect and vague surrogate of “degree” of taxonomic resemblance — arguing (quite properly of course, however nonoperationally) that the closer the relation­ship between two separated lineages, the more likely that any homoplastic characters will arise by parallelism. Scott expressed his frustration at this unsurmountable situation on the page following his initial definitions (1891, p. 363): “The distinction between the two classes of phenomena [parallelism and convergence] is obviously one of degree rather than of kind, and it will therefore be convenient to consider them together.”

The greater salience of parallelism for non-Darwinian formalists, and for anti-darwinian theorists of various stripes, in late 19th and early 20th century evolutionary debates. We understand why parallelism faded from general consideration when the strict adaptationism of later and hardened versions of the Modern Synthesis pushed the general subject of internal constraint to a periphery of intellectual concern and presumed relevance. Similarly, we should easily comprehend why the same phenomenon — and the importance of distinguishing its component of constraint from the purely adaptational basis of conver­gence — would have generated more interest and greater clarity of definition during the period of its initial formulation (1890's to 1920's), when non-Darwinian formalist, and more overtly anti-Darwinian orthogenetic and saltational, theories enjoyed considerable vogue as adjuncts or alternatives to natural selection.

Two linguistically and geographically defined traditions of argument rein­force my contention that parallelism has always been understood and de­bated as a theory of constraint based on homologous generators for the origin of homoplastic similarities. First, the American paleontologists who initially codified the concept of parallelism did so in the context of pluralis­tic support for non-Darwinian internal mechanisms of evolutionary change (working in conjunction, or potentially in opposition, to natural selection, which they also accepted as a valid mechanism). We find parallelism sufficiently interesting today as an indicator of preferred internal channels that selection can exploit in coordinated evolutionary change. Imagine the even greater theoretical interest of parallelism for evolutionists who hoped to dis­cover, in its workings, new principles and mechanisms of change that might fundamentally enrich or alter the basis of evolutionary theory.

In the article that first defined parallelism, for example, Scott (1891, pp. 370-371) argued that the orthogenetic linearity of parallel series implied a primary nonselectionist cause for phylogenetic transformation, since lineages under the control of natural selection should exhibit more temporal fluctuation: “So far as the series of fossil mammals which we have been con­sidering are concerned, the developmental history appears to be very direct, and subject to comparatively little fluctuation, advancing steadily in a definite direction, though with slight deviations.”

In his 1902 article, Osborn invoked parallelism more explicitly as a central argument for internal control of phylogenetic directionality, and against nat­ural selection as a primary cause of change. In fact, following a standard tra­dition of continental non-Darwinian argument, Osborn demoted natural se­lection to a mere “exciting cause” (“exciting,” that is, in the literal sense of “initiating,” not in the modern meaning of “thrilling”) that can arouse the in­herent channels of necessary change, and provoke homoplastic evolution along parallel paths. In his typically regal way, Osborn begins his paper by quoting his own prophetic words of 1897: “My study of teeth in a great many phyla of Mammalia in past times has convinced me that there are fun­damental predispositions to vary in certain directions; that the evolution of teeth is marked out beforehand by hereditary influences which extend back hundreds of thousands of years. These predispositions are aroused under cer­tain exciting causes [note his verbal demotion of natural selection] and the progress of tooth development takes a certain form converting into actuality what has hitherto been potentiality.”

Osborn then ends his paper (1902, p. 270) by explicitly citing the “latent or potential” homology of parallelism as an alternative to natural selection among causes of evolutionary change:

These homoplastic cusps [of teeth in independent lineages of mammalian evolution] do not arise from selection out of fortuitous variations, be­cause they develop directly and are not picked from a number of alter­nates . . . We are forced to the conclusion that in the original tritubercular constitution of the teeth there is some principle which unifies the subsequent variation and evolution up to a certain point. Herein lies the appropriateness of Lankester's phrases, “a likeness of material to begin with.” Philosophically, predeterminate variation and evolution brings us upon dangerous ground. If all that is involved in the Tertiary molar tooth is included in a latent or potential form in the Cretaceous molar tooth we are nearing the emboitement hypothesis of Bonnet or the archetype of Oken and Owen.



Second, continental European theorists in the formalist tradition (see Chapters 4 and 5) had always emphasized constraint channeled by laws of form as a primary alternative to functionalist theories like natural selec­tion. These scientists should therefore have taken a particular interest in par­allelism, especially in its distinction from convergence for the origin of homo­plastic similarity — for convergence exalts natural selection, while parallelism stresses internal channeling and supports the standard continental view of se­lection as a mere potentiator, or at most a minor diverter, of predictable and law like changes that must follow internally specified rules of morphogenetic transformation.

Haas and Simpson (1946) cite all the major evolutionary theorists among continental paleontologists of the early to mid 20th century — particularly Abel, Dacque and Schindewolf — in support of these weights and defini­tions. In 1921, for example, Dacque compared parallelism with Eimer's anti-Darwinian concept of orthogenesis (see pp. 355–365 for full discussion on Eimer's views), while stressing the distinction of parallelism and convergence by the predominant causality of constraint vs. adaptation (Haas and Simp­son, 1946, p. 335).

G. G. Simpson and the causal vs. geometric definition of parallelism. With parallelism thus falsely depicted as somehow contrary to selection, one can hardly blame the resurgent Darwinians of the Modern Synthesis for their diminished attention to a phenomenon that had been un­fairly cited against the cause of change that they now wished to reassert as primary, if not virtually exclusive. (This history provides another concrete il­lustration of a general argument about older vs. modern versions of con­straint that I advance throughout this book. The older versions interpreted constraint as contrary to selection, thus earning the indifference or enmity of Darwinian theorists when they regained ascendancy during the 1930's and af­terwards. This unfortunate historical situation clouded the utility of con­straint within Darwinian theory as an adjunct, a potentiator, or (at most dis­tinction) an orthogonal source of evolutionary change. Modern versions of constraint can overcome this unfortunate division and reunite these two vital sources, formalist and functionalist, into an expanded and more general the­ory of Darwinian evolution.)

But the most perceptive of Darwinian theorists would not let such a contin­gent historical happenstance extinguish an important concept and distinction within the scope of evolutionary causality. In particular, G. G. Simpson — in­disputably the most brilliant and biologically sophisticated of 20th century evolutionary paleontologists — continually emphasized the significance of a causal concept of parallelism based upon constraint, and the importance of distinguishing this mode of homoplasy from the opposite style of conver­gence based entirely upon shared adaptive contexts rather than shared ho­mologous generators.

In his epochal 1945 treatise on principles of taxonomy and classification of mammals, Simpson drew a sharply dichotomous distinction between homology and convergence (1945, p. 9): “Animals may resemble one another be­cause they have inherited like characters, homology, or because they have independently acquired like characters, convergence.” Simpson then spoke of parallelism as “a third sort of process [that] also produces similarities” (p. 9) — for he recognized the “hybrid” nature of a concept that required inde­pendent episodes of similar selection, but nonetheless constructed homo-plastic likenesses from homologous generators in two separate lines. With his usual insight, Simpson made the proper theoretical separation, but then ran right into the old wall of stymied practice — for the biology of his day knew no methods for identifying the homologous generators that could mark a homoplastic similarity as parallel rather than convergent. Unable to cash out his theoretical clarity in actual practice, Simpson threw in the towel and ad­mitted operational defeat (1945, p. 9):

It is a complication that a third sort of process also produces similarities: parallelism. The term is descriptive rather than explanatory and refers to the fact that distinct groups of common origin frequently evolve in much the same direction after the discontinuity between them has arisen, so that at a later stage the phyla may have characters in common that were not visible in the common ancestry but that tend, nevertheless, to be more or less in proportion to the nearness of that ancestry. This propor­tional tendency distinguishes parallelism from convergence, but the dis­tinction is far from absolute. The two phenomena intergrade continu­ously and are often indistinguishable in practice.



Simpson (1945, p. 10) also stressed the intermediate nature of parallelism in phylogenetic inference, recognizing that even homoplastic characters usu­ally record reasonably close genealogical affinity (in their common origin from homologous generators) in cases of parallelism, but must be regarded as confounders of affinity in cases of convergence: “Homology is always valid evidence of affinity. Parallelism is less direct and reliable, but it is also valid evidence within somewhat broader limits. It may lead to overestimates of de­gree of affinity, but it is not likely to induce belief in wholly false affinity. Con­vergence, however, may be wholly misleading, and a principal problem of morphological classification on a phylogenetic basis is the selection of charac­ters that are homologous or parallel and not convergent.”

In his 1961 book on Principles of Animal Taxonomy, Simpson continued to express his frustration at the conceptual need, but operational impossibil­ity, of distinguishing parallelism from convergence. “The distinction of paral­lelism from convergence is vital,” he writes (1961b, p. 106). Fifteen years af­ter his joint paper with Haas, and their disagreement over geometrical versus causal definitions of the terms, Simpson stated in frustration (1961b, p. 103): “Parallelism is the independent occurrence of similar changes in groups from a common ancestry and because they had a common ancestry. Some students (for example, Haas in Haas and Simpson, 1946) have preferred a more purely descriptive definition, especially by the geometrical model of parallel lines, symbolizing two lineages both changing but not becoming significantly either more or less similar . . . Most taxonomists do, however, consider that the term parallelism should be used only when community of ancestry is perti­nent to the phenomenon.”

Simpson concludes his discussion (1961b, p. 106) with the clearest state­ment I have ever read for citing homology of underlying generators as the ba­sis of parallelism, and on the joint operation of both overt selection and un­derlying homology in the evolution of homoplastic structures by parallelism:

Parallelism has several theoretical bases that help one to understand and also to recognize it. The structure of an ancestral group inevitably re­stricts the lines of possible evolutionary change. That simple fact greatly increases the probability that among the number of descendant lineages several or all will follow one line. That probability will be further rein­forced by natural selection in a geographically expanding and actively speciating group if the ecologies of diverse lineages remain similar in re­spect to the adaptations involved in the parallelism. The degree of dependence on similar ecology resembles that of convergence, but the retention of homologous characters from the relatively near common ancestry usually distinguishes parallelism. The parallel lineages (unlike those only convergent) furthermore start out with closely similar coadapted genetic systems, and similar changes are more likely to keep the system ade­quately coadapted.



Parallelism as a “gray zone” between homology and con­vergence. Despite Simpson's careful separations, and his stress on their theoretical importance, many biologists ignored the important theoretical differences between these two subcategories of homoplasy. If they recognized parallelism and convergence as distinctive terms at all, they often could not state any rationale for the terminology beyond the triviality of an abstract and formal geometric difference between parallel and converging lines.

But thoughtful evolutionists continued to struggle with the “hybrid” char­acter of parallelism. Michener (1949), for example, in the finest technical ap­plication of the concept, honored the causal (rather than geometric) distinc­tion: “The potentiality for similar changes, resulting in parallel characters, no doubt results from the fact that related animals have homologous chromo­somes and genes” (1949, p. 140).

The cladistic revolution in taxonomic practice also forced renewed atten­tion to the distinction, and to the “intermediate” status of parallelism in pro­ducing homoplastic structures based on homologous generators — leading, for example, to Saether's (1983) concept of “underlying synapomorphies,” defined as “the capacity to develop synapomorphy” or “close parallelism as a result of inherited factors within a monophyletic group” (Saether, 1983, p. 343).

The acknowledgment of homologous generators actually led some taxonomists, including such leaders as Mayr (1974), to include parallelism within a broader definition of homology, while most researchers continued to rank parallelism as an uncomfortable subcategory of homoplasy (Patterson, 1988), or as a “hybrid” notion based on homoplastic origin from homolo­gous generators (as in Saether, 1983). Perhaps Patterson (1988, p. 619) put the matter best by writing: “In morphology, the 'gray zone' between homol­ogy and nonhomology concerns congruence — or inferred common ances­try — and whether parallelism (which does invoke common ancestry) should be included or excluded from homology.”

The operational rescue of parallelism by evo-devo. The culmination of more than a century of conceptual and terminological struggle may now be epitomized in a triumphalist tone usually shunned in science, but clearly justified in this rare case: the development of genetic and developmen­tal techniques that established the field of evo-devo have finally allowed biol­ogists to identify the homologous generators that always specified the con­cept of parallelism in theoretical terms. Parallelism has now, and finally after a century of terminological recognition, become an operational subject for evolutionary research. Moreover, the first flood of results has revealed a depth and extent of parallelism among distant phyla that strict Darwinians had explicitly deemed inconceivable, and that even the most enthusiastic well-wishers and partisans of constraint did not dare to imagine in their fond­est dreams (unless their capacity for imagination greatly exceeded the scope of this particular rooter — see Gould, 1977b).





A SYMPHONY IN FOUR MOVEMENTS ON THE ROLE OF HISTORICAL CONSTRAINT IN EVOLUTION: TOWARDS THE HARMONIOUS REBALANCING OF FORM AND FUNCTION IN EVOLUTIONARY THEORY





As a literary device, metaphor spans a particularly broad band of relative merit — from treacherous comparisons virtually guaranteed to confuse or mis­state a causal analysis, to illuminating analogies intended to explicate the un­familiar or to impose a useful and sensible order upon an otherwise inchoate mass of ideas and information. By invoking the following risky comparison of the major ideas and putative theoretical reforms of evo-devo to the four movements of a classical symphony, I mean to highlight some aspects of the comparison, while abjuring others. I do not, in the most obviously non-adaptive feature of the metaphor, claim any chronological basis, or any nu­merical ordering of importance, for the four sequential themes.

Rather, I rest my case for the utility of this organizing device upon an ad­mittedly peculiar isomorphism between these disparate realms. I believe that the burgeoning literature on the genetics of development can be explicated most usefully (in terms of a probable enduring influence upon evolutionary theory) as a set of four subjects — and that these subjects, presented in their most sensible and logical order, invite a close comparison with the “stan­dard” sequence and thematic progression of the four movements in a classical symphony: statement, development, scherzo, and generalization — or, for the literature of evo-devo, deep homology, pervasive parallelism (for features once deemed convergent), saltational musings, and reasons for the markedly inhomogeneous occupation of morphospace among animal phyla.

DEEP HOMOLOGY, ARCHETYPAL THEORIES, AND HISTORICAL CONSTRAINT. In the most important general book on evo-devo written in the last decade of a millennium, Raff (1996, p. 428) astutely epitomized the importance of constraint for an enriched and revised version of Darwinian theory.

A long-standing and important theoretical conception of the relation­ship between development and evolution is that of developmental con­straints. The idea that developmental rules can direct or constrain the course of evolution has two origins. A number of evolutionists, particu­larly in the generation following Darwin, took antiselectionist positions, and posited that internal forces direct evolution and produce long-term trends independent of the external environment. That is not a tenable position, but neither is extreme selectionism. Internal genetic and devel­opmental constraints of various kinds must exist, but... they are diverse and poorly understood. Yet if internal factors constrain evolution, they are hardly a minor issue. The acceptance of internal constraints does not mean that Darwinian selection is unimportant, but it does mean that the variation presented to selection is not random.



Two aspects of this statement capture both the optimism and the theoreti­cal importance of this emerging field. By defining the subject of constraint as collateral and helpful to selectionism (rather than oppositional, if not substitutional, as in most 19th century versions of internalism, as Raff mentions above and as I document extensively in Chapters 4 and 5), Raff depicts the growth of evo-devo as interactive building in a different architectural style, rather than as demolition. Secondly, by summarizing the main import of con­straint for Darwinian theory in the claim “that the variation presented to selection is not random,” Raff correctly identifies the locus of greatest impor­tance for evolutionary theory — for the logic of pure selectionism does pre­suppose nondirectional variability (see pp. 144–146), and the existence of strongly preferred channels, based on the architecture and history of develop­ment, does require an important restructuring (not just a minor nuancing) of Darwinian logic.

I argued in the last section that development establishes preferred channels of variation in two primary modes, both “positive” in their salutary contribu­tion to a more accurate and sophisticated evolutionary theory. But by mecha­nistic criteria of channels as limitations or impetuses, we might deem the first mode — based on the surprising discovery of “deep homology” in the genetic basis of conserved developmental pathways among distantly related animal phyla — as “negative,” in highlighting the limitations thus imposed upon di­rections of change. (Nonetheless, combinatorial possibilities remain as broad as realized bilaterian diversity, so these limits may direct, but surely do not seem to throttle life — see Kirschner and Gerhart, 1998 and references therein, on flexibility and evolvability.) The second mode — based on the equally sur­prising discovery of common genetic pathways underlying several textbook cases of supposed convergence, thus recasting these homoplasies as parallel­isms potentiated by common developmental architecture — then achieves its best explication as a set of positive impetuses for channeling adaptive change into accessible pathways.

However, in Raff's larger sense, both modes express the common, cardinal feature of nonisotropic, or channeled, variation — thus imposing a preferred structure, from the “inside” of organic development, upon the raw material that external forces of Darwinian selection must utilize. Both modes also de­lighted (or disturbed) evolutionary biologists with the greatest surprises in the last generation of our science — based on results that were actively unexpected in theory, not merely unsuspected for lack of imagination. I shall, in this first section, discuss deep homology as the more general and fundamental of the two modes. My second section shall then extend Raff's theme of directed variation as the focus of constraint within evolutionary theory, this time through the positive channel of unanticipated parallelisms.

In a famous line from the prologue of Faust, Goethe wrote: Es irrt der Mensch, so lang er strebt — we err, so long as our struggle lasts. Goethe proba­bly intended this celebrated statement as a romantic effusion about human striving in general, but we may apply his words to the nearly universal atti­tude of fellow biologists, at least since Darwin's watershed of 1859, towards Goethe's own brainchild in developmental biology, and towards the general approach to morphology — a word of Goethe's own invention — embodied within such theories.

As discussed in extenso in Chapter 4, Goethe's theory of the leaf as a botan­ical archetype for all lateral structures off the angiosperm stem (including cot­yledons and all flower parts) presented the most famous botanical proposal among a set of archetypal theories that would soon sweep the world of ani­mal morphology as well, culminating in the vertebral archetype advocated by Owen for all major parts of the vertebrate skeleton (including the skull and limbs) and, most extensively, by Etienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire for the gener­ative basis of all animal form (first for all vertebrates, then adding arthro­pods, then mollusks, and no doubt proceeding further had he not then en­countered the wrath and active opposition of Cuvier and his functionalist theory of adaptive form — see Chapter 4, pp. 291–312).

The argument that structural and morphological archetypes underlie, and actively generate, a basic and common architecture in taxonomically distant groups defines — both as a fact of our profession's actual history and as a dic­tate of the logic of our explanatory theories — the strongest kind of claim for developmental constraint as a major factor in patterns of evolutionary change and the occupation of morphospace. I suspect that the depth of this challenge has always been recognized, but the empirical case for such con­straining archetypes has remained so weak, since the heyday of Geoffroy and Owen some 150 years ago, that the issue simply didn't generate much serious concern — and rightly so.

The concept of interphylum archetypes, deemed too bizarre to warrant ac­tive refutation, experienced the curt and derisive dismissal reserved for crack­pot ideas in science. (Goldschmidt's saltational apostasy, on the other hand, inspired voluminous and impassioned denial because his ideas did seem suf­ficiently and dangerously plausible to the Modern Synthesis — see pp. 451–466). Indeed, the notion of interphylum archetypes struck most biologists as so inconceivable in theory that empirical counterclaims hardly seemed neces­sary. After all, the notion required extensive genetic homology among phyla, and the power of natural selection, working on different paths for a mini­mum of 530 million years since the origin of distinct phyla in the Cambrian explosion, seemed to guarantee such thorough change at effectively every nucleotide position that the requisite common foundation could not possibly have been maintained (see Mayr, 1963, p. 609, as previously discussed on pp. 539 and 1066).

When, in the mid-1980's, initial studies began to discern deep homology between arthropod and vertebrate Hox genes, I well remember saying to my­self (amidst my astonishment about a result so consonant with the theoretical framework that I had espoused in 1977 in my first book, Ontogeny and Phylogeny, but had not dared to view as subject to empirical validation in my lifetime): yes, perhaps for some functional commonality in the broadest con­struction of basic body axes (A-P in particular), but surely not for the more detailed structural homology — particularly between arthropod metameres and vertebrate somites — demanded by the old archetypal theories. But, only 15 years later, central nuggets of validity had been affirmed for nearly all the classical archetypal theories, even the most farfetched. Needless to say, the ar­chetypes do not function as their inventors claimed. The differences between leaves and floral parts do not arise by progressive refinement of sap up the stem; and the abstract vertebra does not function as a generator for all major features of the axial skeleton (including ribs and appendages) in vertebrates and arthropods.

Moreover, at least two prominent claims for the vertebral archetype proba­bly hold little, if any, validity. The distinctive features of the vertebrate skull and forebrain seem to arise, in large part, under the formative influence of the distinctive neural crest (see the classical statement of Gans and Northcutt, 1983), and not as a complex fusion (much like an arthropod tagma) of a definable number of rostral vertebrae (from 3 to 8 in various formulations). And although some broad homologies may set the basic axes of limbs in both arthropods and vertebrates (see pp. 1138–1142), the structures cannot be re­garded as basically homologous, even in underlying developmental path­ways; nor can they be derived from any particular component of a general­ized vertebra. Nonetheless, all three major archetypal theories of Goethe and Geoffroy — the classical sources of ridicule for the general concept — have now been confirmed in aspects that cannot be dismissed as superficial or secondary.





MEHR LICHT (MORE LIGHT) ON GOETHE'S ANGIOSPERM ARCHETYPE. Students of the mustard Arabidopsis have discovered unexpected validity in central features of Goethe's founding theory of the archetypal leaf (see Pelaz et al., 2000). Starting at the bottom, Meinke (1992) studied the lee (leafy cot­yledon) mutant that partially transforms cotyledons into leaves. He argued that the wild-type allele (LEC) activates “a wide range of embryo-specific pathways in higher plants” (p. 1647), and that suppression by the lee muta­tion therefore causes reversion to a ground state — which, as Goethe proposed so long ago, most closely resembles a stem leaf in basic form. (Biologists with a zoomorphic bias, including the author of this book, may be confused by a claim that embryonic features might thus be conceived as departures from a ground state. The directionality of bilaterian ontogeny, with embryonic fea­tures as transient and formative, leads us to equate embryonic forms with any sensible concept of a “ground state.” But plants maintain embryonic tissues throughout life as restricted and persistently specialized regions on differenti­ated foundations that animal biologists might tend to regard as “adult.” Therefore, a botanical rationale for viewing these foundations as a ground state, with embryonic tissues as a specialization, can easily be defended.)

Meinke (1992, p. 1649) concludes: “The phenotype of leafy cotyledon sug­gests that the difference between leaves and cotyledons in Arabidopsis is con­trolled by a single regulatory gene (LEC) expressed only during embryo-genesis.” Then, in a statement strikingly evocative of Goethe's archetypal theory, he portrays (1992, p. 1649) the ordinary stem leaf as a ground state, with all its serial homologs (to apply this zoomorphic term to cotyledons and, putatively, to flower parts) as specializations thereupon: “The preferred model is that LEC functions to activate a wide range of embryo-specific path­ways in plants. Loss of gene function disrupts embryonic maturation and re­turns mutant cotyledons to a basal developmental state. The leafy appearance of mutant cotyledons was unexpected because there was no evidence that cot­yledons defective in maturation should be transformed into foliage leaves. However, this observation is consistent with the origin of cotyledons as spe­cialized leaves during plant evolution and the homology of embryonic cotyle­dons and vegetative leaves.”

For the more complex organs of inflorescence at the other end, Weigel and Meyerowitz, in their classic review (1994) of the ABC model (see pp. 1063–1065) for floral development in Arabidopsis (and many other angiosperms, though perhaps not all, see Kramer and Irish, 1999), posed a first key exten­sion beyond the model's basic elucidation: “The ABC model left one compli­cation, though: what happens in the absence of all organ identity activity” (p. 203). Weigel and Meyerowitz then turned to Goethe for the classic predic­tion based on notions of the archetypal leaf: “Goethe (1790) had proposed that floral organs represent modified leaves, suggesting that a vegetative leaf is the ground state of floral organs.”

Weigel and Meyerowitz presented striking evidence to confirm this Goethian prediction that suppression of all ABC activity should cause presump­tive floral parts to approach the ground state of stem leaves. The sequential action of ABC genes permits a simple formulation of tests for this hypothesis. AC double mutants, for example, should knock out determinants for the out­ermost sepals of whorl 1 (triggered by A genes alone) and the innermost car­pels of whorl 4 (C genes alone), but impose less effect upon the petals and sta­mens of whorls 2 and 3, which also require the influence of B genes (see p. 1063 and Fig. 10-12). Experiments then confirmed this precise, and rather odd, prediction: “Indeed, organs in these two whorls are very much like vegetative leaves — they develop with stipules, are green and covered with branched hairs, and senesce slowly, all characteristics of leaves but not of floral organs” (Weigel and Meyerowitz, 1994, p. 203). By the same logic, tri­ple mutants should grow all floral parts in leaf-like form — as they do: “In tri­ple mutants that lack A, B, and C activities, all floral organs resemble leaves” (pp. 203–204 — and Fig. 10-14), thus supporting (Pelaz et al, 2000, p. 202) “the theory that flower organs are simply modified leaves.” Theissen and Saedler (2001, p. 470) add, with specific homage to Goethe: “combined loss-of-function of class A, B, and C genes results in a transformation of all floral organs to leaves, corroborating Goethe's view that leaves are a developmental ground state.”

Moreover, gain of function mutations also confirm the model by imposing inner floral expression upon outer parts, thus resembling the action, for a dif­ferent symmetry of radial whorls, of classical homeotic mutations of Drosophila, expressed in a linear, anteroposterior array. Over expression of C genes, for example (1994, p. 206), represses A functions in whorls 1 and 2, “with carpels where sepals are usually found, and stamens in the places ordi­narily occupied by petals” (p. 206).

Later work has revealed some of the upstream regulators of this system. For example, Pelaz et al. (2000) identified three genes (named SEP1/2/3) re­quired for the action of B and C genus that regulate the inner three whorls of petals, stamens and carpels. In triple mutant Aribadopsis plants that suppress the action of SEP1/2/3, all floral whorls develop as sepals (which are regu­lated by A genes). (See Honma and Goto, 2001, for later data on the even

broader role of SEP genes in “providing flower-specific activity” (p. 528) in combination with genes of the ABC series.)

Other studies provide additional confirmation (in modern genetic form) for Goethe's original formalist notion of leaves as a ground state. A “meristem identity factor” LEAFY (LFY) potentiates APETALA1 (API), which, in turn, activates the ABC floral genes. Wagner et al. (1999, p. 582) demonstrate that this sequence of LEAFY to API is “necessary and sufficient for this transi­tion” (p. 582). Standard techniques for documenting the effects of both loss and gain-of-function mutants confirm this cascade. In the lfy-6 mutant, sup­pressing the action of LFY, “most flowers are replaced by leaves and second-order shoots”; while over expression of either LFY or API “results in for­mation of flowers or leaves and flowers in positions normally occupied by leaves” (Wagner et al., 1999, p. 582. See further confirmations in Busch et al., 1999).

Extending the model to other angiosperm clades, Hofer et al. (1997) stud­ied PEAFLO, the pea homolog of LFY. They performed several experiments to extend Goethe's formalist concept of morphological serial homology, now abetted by new data on genetic and developmental homology, between leaves and flower parts. They state: “A striking comparison can be made between the similar developmental units of compound leaves and flowers: both arise laterally from primordia derived from the shoot apical meristem; both pro­duce lateral, leaf-like organs; and both are determinate.” Hofer et al. (1997) then affirmed and extended the evidence for developmental homology by (1) identifying pleiotropic mutants that affect both leaf and floral development in similar ways, and (2) by studying homeotic mutations that “result in the con­version of floral organs to leaf-like structures” (p. 581). Their concluding remark, reinforced by a later observation of Theissen and Saedler (2001, p. 469), might have caused Faust to lose his bet with Mephistopheles — by in­ducing such delight that this restless, archetypal romantic might finally have savored a present moment with sufficient gusto to blurt out the fateful phrase that would seal his doom: “verweile doch, du bist so schon” (stay awhile, thou art so beautiful). Hofer et al. write (1997, p. 586): “Compound leaves and flowers can thus be considered to be derivatives of the same ancestral structure.” Theissen and Saedler simply conclude: “Goethe was right when he proposed that flowers are modified leaves.”





HOXOLOGY AND GEOFFROY'S FIRST ARCHETYPAL THEORY OF SEGMENTAL HOMOLOGY



An epitome and capsule history of hoxology. These Goethian confirmations extend, at least for now, little beyond the serial homology of apparently disparate parts on the same plant. But archetypal claims for homology across distantly related phyla raise far more serious theoretical problems. No Shockwaves attended the discovery of common genetic and de­velopmental pathways for the serial array of arthropod appendages, despite their functional differentiation as antennae, mouthparts, legs, genital claspers, etc. But the discovery that homological pathways also persist among ani­mal phyla that have evolved independently since the Cambrian explosion has reversed previous certainties and brought Geoffroy's despised archetypal the­ories into renewed respectability.

The roots of this great discovery extend back (at least terminologically) to another key figure of this book, the English geneticist William Bateson (see Chapter 5, pp. 396–415). Bateson became fascinated by a class of mutations with the peculiar, and often large, effect of causing the characteristic form of one member in a serial array to develop in a different location usually occu­pied by another member of the same array. Bateson called such mutations “homeotic,” and their peculiar forms, almost humorous in some cases, gave them a special salience among geneticists. Unsurprisingly — for arthropods are serial organisms par excellence, while this particular insect became the lynchpin of genetics — the homeotic mutations of Drosophila became classics of the genre, famous for their oddness as well as their utility (for geneticists, not for the afflicted flies!).

We all remember our undergraduate textbook pictures — and the attendant, inevitable thoughts of Hollywood monster movies — of flies with such muta­tions as antennapedia (legs where antennae “ought” to be), bithorax (with another pair of wings rather than halteres on the third thoracic segment, thus seeming to “revert” the fly — a false interpretation as we shall see — to the an­cestral four winged condition), and bithoraxoid (with a supernumerary pair of legs on the first abdominal segment, thus giving eight legs in toto and seem­ing to mock the very definition of the class Hexapoda). In my favorite exam­ple, a homeotic mutation in mosquitoes actually replaces the biting stylets with a pair of legs, thus rendering the creature “ouchless.” I entertained vari­ous fantasies about breeding these lovely mutants, introducing them into nat­ural populations, and destroying this scourge of humanity from within. But, alas and unsurprisingly, the scheme would never work, and I couldn't interest a single venture capitalist — for the mutation is effectively lethal; a mosquito that cannot bite to draw blood cannot feed at all.

E. B. Lewis used such homeotic mutations to develop his model for the evolution and operation of the bithorax complex in Drosophila, the break­through that effectively began the modern study of evo-devo and that won a most deserved Nobel Prize for its pioneer. (The Nobel awards include no cate­gory for evolutionary studies. Only twice has a prize been given for work in evolutionary biology, each time by nuancing the definition of medicine to in­clude work with legitimate consequences for health, but scarcely in the main­stream of medical research — first to Lorenz, Tinbergen, and von Frisch, for foundational studies in ethology, and second to my dear colleagues Ed Lewis, Christiane Nusslein-Volhard, and Eric Wieschaus for unlocking the genetic basis of fundamental architectures in animal development.)

In a simple and brilliant model, Lewis (1978) inferred that the bithorax complex evolved by gene duplication, with all members (up to eight) remain­ing aligned in a tandem array on the third chromosome. Since these BX-C genes regulated developmental positions in the posterior part of the thorax and throughout the abdomen (see Fig. 10-15), Lewis assumed that the func­tional basis of duplication lay in the need for more genes to achieve evolu­tionary differentiation from the ancestral homonomy of repeated and similar (if not identical) appendages on each body segment — in this case, and for dipterans in general, to suppress the development of legs on abdominal segments and to convert the second pair of wings (on the third thoracic segment) into the small pair of balancing halteres.

The model then implied an elegant mechanism for gene functioning in morphological differentiation. Lewis argued that the first gene in the array turned on in the second thoracic segment and in all posterior segments, with each subsequent gene having its anterior boundary of expression one or two seg­ments further back, but then turning on from there to the posterior end of the fly. Clearly, such a system would build a simple and linear gradient with least gene product at the anterior end of expression for the entire array (where only the first gene turns on), and most products at the posterior end of the ani­mal (where all genes are active).

The further beauty of this model then lies in the simple testability of the implied





10-15. E. B. Lewis's original, brilliant, but not entirely correct model for developmental action of genes in the bithorax complex of Drosophila. Lewis assumed that differentiation of complexity from original homonomy, particularly the con­version of the second pair of wings to halteres, and the suppression of legs on the abdominal segments, required a duplication of further genes in the set. He pro­posed a tandem array of up to eight genes, each turning on in sequence, but with expression beginning in successively more posterior parts of the developing larva — thus establishing a gradient with ever more gene product accumulating towards the rear of the animal. Therefore — and this part of the model remains basically correct — loss-of-function mutations should weaken the gradient and cause anterior structures to develop in a more posterior position; while gain-of-function mutations should intensify the gradient and cause posterior structures to develop in more anterior sites.





mechanism for initiating appropriate structures in each segment: the more gene product, the more posterior the appearance (given a linear gradi­ent with greatest concentration at the rear end). Thus, any loss-of-function mutation, leading to a weakening of the gradient, should cause anterior struc­tures to develop in a more posterior position. In a corresponding manner, gain-of-function mutations, or ectopically induced overexpressions, should intensify the gradient and cause posterior structures to grow in more anterior positions. Shifts in both these directions would produce homeotic effects un­der Bateson's original definition — and the BX-C complex had originally been recognized by a set of arresting homeotic mutations.

Lewis's model neatly explained the most famous and puzzling homeotic transformations, both based on loss-of-function mutations. Bithorax, the cel­ebrated four-winged fly, does not represent an atavistic reversion to the ances­tral state, but arose by a weakening of the gradient that caused the third tho­racic segment (usually bearing the much reduced second set of wings in the derived form of balancing halteres) to develop instead as a supernumerary second thoracic. Since second thoracics bear ordinary wings, a fly with two-second thoracics will grow two pairs of wings. Similarly, the equally peculiar eight-legged, or bithoraxoid, fly developed by another loss-of-function muta­tion under the same rules of Lewis's gradient. The gradient became suf­ficiently weakened in the first abdominal segment to cause this normally leg­less module to develop instead as a supernumerary third thoracic. Since each thoracic segment bears a pair of legs (giving insects their defining six for the animal's three thoracic segments), a fly with (effectively) four thoracic seg­ments would grow eight legs.

As a virtually definitional consequence of truly great theories developed in a previous terra incognita, several aspects of an original formulation in­variably turn out to be wrong, while central concepts persist in greatly im­proved form. The most interesting development since the classical formula­tion (Lewis, 1978), has reversed Lewis's argument that the duplications arose to provide positional cues needed to potentiate the evolution of the distinctive insect body plan (in particular, to suppress legs on the abdomen and convert wings to halteres on the last thoracic segment). In formulating his original hy­pothesis, Lewis (1978) made the conventional assumption of both Darwinian and ordinary vernacular reasoning: that greater specialization of the phenotype would correlate with increase in the number of generating units. But the idea that morphological novelties must “await” the provision of new genetic material by duplication (or some other process) has been disproven by the fascinating discovery — with central implications for my general argument about constraint, to be developed in the concluding fourth “movement” of this “symphony” (pp. 1147–1178) — that all major arthropod Hox genes had already appeared before the separation of arthropod classes and, for that matter, of protostome phyla as well.

Homologs for all 8 insect Hox genes have been found in other arthro­pod classes, including the maximally homonomous (identically segmented) Myriapoda and, for that matter, in the equally homonomous sister phylum of onychophorans (Grenier et al., 1997). De Rosa et al. (1999) conclude that the full complement must be even more ancient, as phyletic analysis indicates a minimum of 7 Hox genes for the bilaterian ancestor, and at least 8 for the common ancestor of protostome phyla.

Thus, the differentiation of distinctive bilaterian body plans has occurred not by the duplication or recruitment of additional Hox genes, but by changes in their regulation and their downstream targets. Presumably, Hox genes “read” positional information to set the location of differentiating structures, thereby triggering the cascade of downsteam architects, but not building the varied structures themselves. As Warren et al. (1994, p. 461) write: Hox genes “provided a pre-existing groundplan upon which insect segmental diversity evolved.” Carroll (1995, p. 483) therefore restated the Lewis hypothesis as follows: “What has evolved in the course of insect and fly evo­lution are not new genes but new regulatory interactions between BX-C pro­teins and genes involved in limb formation and wing morphogenesis.”

The discovery of the homeobox — a 180 base pair unit coding for a 60 amino acid homeodomain with important regulatory action as a DNA bind­ing protein — as a common constituent of Hox genes (and others as well) opened the floodgates of this amazingly fruitful research in the early 1980's. By probing for homeoboxes, Hox genes could quickly be located and charac­terized, and (even more crucially for evolutionary analysis) their homology to genes of other organisms (even in other phyla) established. The two homeotic complexes of Drosophila — Antennapedia (ANT-C) and Bithorax (BX-C) — were quickly revealed as separated subunits, controlling the positioning of anterior and posterior structures along the A-P axis respectively, of a single Hox cluster that maintains its integrity in the beetle Tribolium, and in other nondipteran insects. Powers et al. (2000) show that the mosquito Anopheles gambiae also retains a single and undivided Hox cluster, so the Drosophila subdivision does not characterize Diptera in general.

The established rules of “hoxology”* vindicated the central principles of morphogenesis in Lewis's model, though under an interestingly different ge­netic regime. (The BX-C component of the Drosophila Hox sequence con­tains only three genes, and if they arose, one from the other, by tandem dupli­cation, these events probably preceded the separation of protostome and deuterostome phyla.) But Lewis could not have been more prescient in rec­ognizing the essential sequence and form of Hox action, and in specifying the implied consequences and tests. Lewis's principle established the basis for discovering homologous genes (and homologous actions) in distant groups, thus potentiating evo-devo's greatest and most surprising discovery of “deep homology” among animal phyla — the key to the reevaluation of historical constraint as an essential component of evolutionary theory and pattern.

Manak and Scott's (1994, p. 63) epitome of “hoxology” illustrates the centrality of Lewis's original conceptions in a different guise:

Several rules governing homeotic gene function have been fairly well conserved. (1) Genes are ordered along the chromosome in the same or­der as their expression and function along the anterior-posterior axis of the animal. (2) More genes are usually expressed in more posterior re­gions. (3) Loss of gene function leads to loss of structures or to develop­ment of anterior structures where more posterior structures should have formed. (4) Activation of genes where they should be off, i.e. gain-of-function mutations, leads to posterior structures developing where more anterior structures would normally be found. To these generalizations we may add some molecular data. (5) Each homeotic gene contains a sin­gle homeobox and encodes a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein, which acts as a transcription factor. (6) Most of the homeotic genes are transcribed in the same direction, with the 5' ends of transcription units oriented toward the posterior end of the Hox cluster.



The perfect colinearity of spatial order along the chromosome with the sequence of morphological differentiation along the developing animal's anteroposterior axis summarizes the most stunning conclusion of this re­search, and also generates most other hoxological regularities. This central property of colinearity supplies a rationale for Lewis's original concept of a gradient generated by tandem duplicates turning on in spatial order along the chromosome. (The spatial sequence usually reflects a temporal order as well, as morphologically anterior and genetically 3' units generally operate first in ontogeny, with differentiation then proceeding temporally towards the poste­rior. Some models of Hox evolution regard the temporal factor as primary (see Duboule, 1992; Dolle et al., 1993; Deutsch and Le Guyader, 1998), and I shall discuss this issue further in the last part of this section.)

The other morphological rules also follow from this central precept of colinearity (Lewis could not have known about items 5 and 6 in the above list when he devised his model). The rules for loss and gain-of-function mu­tations express this key property in a particularly convincing manner. I have already discussed the classic cases of four-winged and eight-legged flies as anteriorizations of posterior segments caused by loss-of-function mutations. The ultimate loss, a fly developing with no Hox gene function at all, leads to lethality, with the dead embryo as a grim and fascinating manifestation of expected rules: a misfit bearing antennae on each of its segments (Shubin et al., 1997, p. 644). (The antennae, or most anterior appendages, normally develop with no Hox activity at all.) The famous Antennapedia mutant in­troduces Hox activity into this anterior region and thus grows a leg in the antennal position. Other gain-of-function mutations also cause posterior struc­tures to move forward, as expected. The first discovered gain mutation in the Hox genes, Contrabithorax (Cbx), causes the second thoracic segment to differentiate as another third thoracic — and the fly therefore grows two pairs of halteres and no wings (Lewis, 1992, p. 1530)!

Raff (1996, p. 307) has expressed the surprise of colinearity, and its evolu­tionary implications for constraint, in the opening words of his section on “frozen controls?”:

Constraint in gene organization is a clouded topic at best, but disturbing observations loom up like logging trucks on a foggy mountain road. The Hox genes have presented the most puzzling instance of deeply con­served gene order. In all phyla so far examined (arthropods, nematodes, and vertebrates), the Antennapedia and Bithorax homeotic gene homologues are clustered, they have the same transcriptional orientation and order of activation, and their transcription is colinear with the body axis. The conservation of a set of clustered genes over half a billion years is difficult enough to accept, but colinearity with body axis defies credibil­ity. Yet it's true.





Vertebrate homologs in structure and action. So far, the formalist or archetypal content of this discussion has been largely limited to the Goethian theme of common bases for the generation of differentiated se­rial homologs in a single organism — in other words, to internal constraints and channels in the evolutionary history of particular forms and lineages. But the more radical archetypal theories — including both of Geoffroy's derided arguments about vertebral foundations and dorsoventral inversions — postu­late the maintenance of such constraints in phyla of distant taxonomic sepa­ration and immensely long periods of independent evolution. Such theories of constraining homologies among groups focus our attention upon the quite different and larger issue of inhomogeneities in the morphospace of animal designs. Does the markedly nonrandom clumping of organisms within this morphospace record historical constraint (where organisms have been, and where, in consequence, they then cannot go), and not only the power of selec­tion (where organisms do best, with all workable positions accessible)?

The discovery of homeoboxes, and the development of simple probes for their identification, provoked a grand “fishing expedition” (or “gold rush” for a more positive metaphor) throughout the taxonomic pool of organ­isms. When such procedures become easy, efficient and inexpensive enough, scientists will be tempted to try experiments that would otherwise be deemed foolish.

As an obvious candidate for crazy experiments, especially in the persis­tently dim light of Geoffroy's archetypal hypothesis for arthropods and ver­tebrates, a search for vertebrate homologs of arthropod Hox genes could hardly have remained unthought or undone, although I doubt that any­one dared to anticipate success (again, see Mayr's canonical quotation on p. 1066). As we all now know and utilize the stunning successes of these ex­periments, a reminder of the initial astonishment, and of the tentative nature of first conclusions, dramatically illustrates how far this research has proceeded in 15 years (and will no doubt extend, thereby rendering these pages obsolete, in just a few additional years).

Not only do Hox genes exist in vertebrates, but also homologs for all Drosophila Hox genes have been found, arranged in the same linear order on chromosomes, and acting with the same colinearity in development along the A-P axis of the vertebrate body. Moreover, vertebrate Hox genes have un­dergone fourfold replication and exist as four paralogous sequences on four different chromosomes. (The vertebrate sister taxon, amphioxus, has but a single Hox cluster, so we can make good inferences about the timing of amplification in our lineage. The agnathan lamprey probably has only three Hox sequences. Interestingly, and uniquely among deuterostomes, or any other animal, the single Hox cluster of amphioxus has an “extra” or 14th Hox gene at the 5' end — see Ferrier et al., 2000.) The vertebrate Hox genes can be arranged into 13 paralogy groups. (No vertebrate genome includes all 13 genes in any single cluster. The mouse, for example, has 39 of the 52 possi­ble genes — Ferrier et al., 2000. The single sequence of amphioxus, however, does include a copy of each Hox gene. The increase in potential number within each group occurred largely by duplications of the posteriormost (5') homologs of Drosophila Hox genes.)

Lewis (1992, p. 1529) captured the excitement of this work in a single opening adverb: “Astonishingly, mice and humans not only have cognates of the BX-C and ANT-C genes in a single HOM-C, but the complexes occur in four sets, each in a different chromosome.” Slack et al. (1997, p. 867) echoes a consensus in designating this discovery of deep homology as “the most spectacular achievement of molecular developmental biology.” Yet initial ex­pectations certainly did not forecast emerging realities. In a 1990 review, De Robertis described the decision to undertake an experiment leading to the discovery of the first vertebrate homeobox gene in Xenopus laevis (Carrasco, McGinnis, Gehring, and De Robertis, 1984 — a good Orwellian year). I was a bit saddened (but mostly amused) by the closing observation on the counter-intuitively negative correlation that often emerges (or gets imposed by the realities of laboratory culture) between youth and willingness to think the unthinkable. To any graduate student reading this book, I can only say: Verbum sapientiae . . . “We decided to try what seemed, at the time, a crazy experiment: to isolate a gene similar to Antennapedia from frog DNA with McGinnis and Gehring's fruit fly homeobox probes. There was little reason to believe that the frog DNA contained such a gene or that the genes of such un­related species would be significantly similar. Still, we felt it was worth the at­tempt. Some of our colleagues were skeptical that such an experiment could ever work, and two of our students declined to help on those grounds.”

The initial discovery of homology in genetic structure for arthropod and vertebrate Hox did not seal the case for evolutionary meaning, since no one yet knew how vertebrate Hox genes operated. Carrasco et al. (1984, p. 409) wrote of their original discovery: “If the frog gene cloned here eventually turns out to have functions similar to those of the fruit fly genes, it would rep­resent the first development-controlling gene identified in vertebrates.” Evidence for similarity of action soon followed, thus securing the argument for meaningful morphogenetic conservation across at least 530 million years, and almost maximal bilaterian separation.

The vertebrate Hox genes also exhibit the crucial colinearity between se­quential order on the chromosome and site of action along the body's A-P axis. Moreover, and most impressively, several early studies confirmed that the familiar arthropod rules for loss-of-function (anterior structures move back) and gain-of-function (posterior structures more forward) generally ap­ply to vertebrate development as well (although unique and non-homeotic ef­fects have also been demonstrated, as in Pollock et al., 1995). For example, in loss-of-function experiments, Le Mouellic et al. (1992) deactivated the mouse Hoxc-8 gene (previously, as in this 1992 paper, called Hox-3.1) and noted anteriorization of vertebral form throughout a substantial region of the body axis extending from the 14th to the 21st vertebra (T7 to LI). In the most striking effect, a supernumerary pair of ribs (characteristic of thoracic verte­brae) grew on the first lumbar vertebra. In general, “vertebrae and ribs dis­played more or less pronounced transformations, turning them into struc­tures resembling those characteristic of the adjacent anterior segment” (1992, p. 251).

Rancourt et al. (1995) also observed anteriorization towards the adjacent segment in mice with disrupted expression of Hoxb-5 and Hoxb-6. The first thoracic segments often lost their rib heads and grew altered lateral processes “making them indistinguishable from C7” (1995, p. 112). Since, with the rar­est exceptions of 6 to 9 in sloths and 6 in manatees, all mammals possess 7 cervical vertebrae (yes, including giraffes, who grow very long cervicals but don't augment their number!), this homeotic transformation of the first tho­racic to the form of a supernumerary (or eighth) cervical seems as curiously in violation of basic taxonomic signatures as the more famous four-winged and eight-legged Drosophila.

In an interesting temporal analog, illustrating the common coincidence of spatial and temporal ordering in the expression of Hox sequences, Dolle et al. (1993) disrupted the most 5' (and therefore last acting) Hoxd-13 gene in mice, and noted a variety of effects upon the limbs, all interpretable as neotenic changes expressing developmental delays evoked by deactivating the last stages of a normal temporal sequence in ontogeny. (I particularly appreci­ate Dolle et al.'s conscious linkage of these genetic results to the classical data on heterochrony (see Gould, 1977b) as a morphological approach to ques­tions about the regulation of development.) Dolle et al. (1993, p. 438) note an interesting relationship between these genetic results and common path­ways of evolutionary change in heterochronic phenotypes, thus invoking this chapter's central theme of positive constraints based on internal channels:

In such evolutionary modifications, the first skeletal elements to be lost are usually those that are formed last during the establishment of the chondrogenic pattern. In Hoxd-13 mutants, the missing skeletal ele­ments are precisely those that appear last during the development of the autopods. There is therefore a correlation between the extreme 5' loca­tion of the Hoxd-13 gene within its complex, its last position in the tem­poral sequence of activation and its involvement in the patterning of the last-appearing structures. The Hoxd-13 phenotype may thus be consid­ered as resulting from a block in a developmental sequence. This arrest occurs at the end of the process and corresponds to the time at which this gene is supposed to become active. Consequently, only those structures appearing at the end of the process, or parts of those structures still developing at this stage, will be altered.



In a corresponding manner, gain-of-function mutations often yield the ex­pected effects of posteriorization. Kessel et al. (1990) induced overexpression of the mouse Hoxa-7 gene (previously called Hox-1.1) by inserting a pro­moter sequence of chicken DNA. Two results indicate a forward movement of posterior structures: (i) the first two vertebrae, the atlas and axis, became simplified, assuming a “structure characteristic of more posterior vertebrae” (1990, p. 302); (ii) the last cervical vertebra of one animal developed a pair of ribs and assumed the form of the next posterior series of thoracic vertebrae.

Kessel and Gruss (1991) then induced overexpression by application of retinoic acid. “Posterior transformations occurred along the complete body axis after RA administration on day 7 of gestation and were accompanied by anterior shifts of Hox gene expression domains in embryos” (1991, p. 89). In a particularly interesting result, Lufkin et al. (1992) ectopically expressed Hoxd-4 (previously Hox-4.2) in regions of the developing head anterior to its usual boundary of expression in somites of the cervical vertebrae. “This ectopic expression results in a homeotic transformation of the occipital bones towards a more posterior phenotype into structures that resemble cervical vertebrae” (p. 835). Phyletic inference is treacherous, and absurd claims have been made in misanalogies between phyletic history and developmental anomaly. But a transformation of skull bones towards the identity of verte­brae does induce thoughts of a presumably more homonomous ancestral ver­tebrate.

Interestingly, the A-P axis of the vertebrate limb also seems to follow the same rules of colinearity. Morgan and Tabin (1994) demonstrated the impor­tance of the Hoxd series in differentiation of the chick limb bud. They ob­served expression of successive 5' genes in progressively more posterior re­gions. Overexpression of Hoxd-11 in regions anterior to its normal domain led to the growth of an additional phalanx in digit 1 (which normally has one, while subsequent digits have 2, 3, and 4 respectively, excluding the ter­minal claw) — “leading to a morphology similar to that of digit 2” (p. 183), a posteriorization anticipated in gain-of-function regimes. Ectopic expression of Hoxd-11 in anterior regions of the chick wing that normally grow no skel­etal elements at all induced the growth of a supernumerary digit (resembling digit 2 in morphology) at the wing's anterior edge.

Tickle (1992) noted the similarity of Hoxd expression in the chick wing to Lewis's gradient model for establishing domains of differentiation. Of the genes at the 5' end of the complex, she wrote (1992, p. 188): “Cells in the posterior part of the bud that will give rise to posterior structures such as a 'little finger' express all the genes, whereas anterior cells that will give rise to the anterior 'thumb' express only Hox-4.4” (Hoxd-9 in modern terminol­ogy). These rules, apparently pervasive (at least in bilaterally symmetrical Bilateria with an A-P axis), also explain several well-known empirical regu­larities in the classical literature on experimental embryology. Citing the cor­relation of spatial order and temporal sequence, Tickle (1992, p. 188) notes: “Because activation can proceed in only one direction along the complex, this explained why manipulations can convert anterior structures into posterior ones, but never posterior into anterior.”

The high degree of sequence similarity often found between homologous arthropod and vertebrate Hox genes (amounting to near identity of homeodomains in some cases) leads to the remarkable, but (by now) scarcely sur­prising, interphylum substitutability revealed by so many experiments (and further discussed as evidence for parallelism in the evolution of eyes on pages 1123–1132). Fly Hox genes, expressed in vertebrates, usually broker the same developmental sequences as their vertebrate homologs — and vice versa. Needless to say, such experiments yield the “correct” morphologies for each phylum, thus reinforcing the well-established conclusion that Hox genes specify proper positions and regulate downstream cascades, but do not build anatomical structures themselves. If Hox genes worked as architects as well as specifiers, then the frights of Hollywood horror movies might become real­ities, and the fly with a human head might really scream, “please help me” from the despair of his spider-web prison.

As one example among so many, the Drosophila Hox gene Antennapedia promotes leg identity, presumably by repressing previously unknown antennal genes. Casares and Mann (1998) have now identified two antennal de­terminers, including homothorax (hth). As one line of evidence, they cloned Meisl, the mouse homolog of Drosophila hth, and expressed it ectopically in the fly's anal primodium, which normally develops without expressing any Hox genes. The anal plates of these flies then grew as antennae. (Most Hox genes suppress antennae, so ectopic expression of Meisl in Hox domains does not generate antennae in odd places, but induces other malformations, in­cluding markedly truncated legs on the thoracic segments.)

As a person with literary pretensions, I am always fascinated by the sure signal of scientific progress conveyed by the evolution of a rationalized and simplified terminology. The original Hox terminologies were eclectic and spe­cific. Students of Drosophila first identified two clusters of homeotic genes, but could not recognize them as separated parts of a single ancestral se­quence. So they awarded different names: Antennapedia complex (ANT-C) for genes regulating anterior structures, and Bithorax complex (BX-C) for genes operating in the fly's rear half. When homologs of both were detected as a single sequence in beetles, terminology began to coalesce, and the entire series assumed the name of HOM-C. When researchers discovered vertebrate homologs, they did not want to use the same names at first, for they had not yet affirmed the corresponding similarities of colinearity and action (and were probably still reeling from the basic shock of the discovery itself). So the vertebrate homologs became Hox genes. This potentially anarchic situation deteriorated further when, after finding four Hox complexes in vertebrates, researchers started naming the genes in each complex by their order of dis­covery, and not by their invariant spatial positions along the chromosome. (Perhaps they did not yet believe that colinearity could prevail here as well.) Thus, Hox-1.1 denoted the first discovered, not the most 3', gene of the first Hox series.

Happily, these discrepancies and illogicalities have now been sorted out and — like the standardization of railroad gauges, or the choice of an internal combustion engine for all cars (thus abandoning a host of other early and workable devices) — a common and integrated terminology has developed, not by the official fiat of any particular meeting or official commission, but by obvious advantages in daily use. The four vertebrate complexes have been re­named Hoxa to Hoxd and the genes within each have been numbered from 1 to 13 in their proper A-P, or 3' to 5', order. Meanwhile, acknowledging the proven homologies of gene structure, position and action, the fly folks have dropped their different name for the complex, and now also denote their se­quence as Hox, rather than HOM-C. This congelation of a simple and unified taxonomy, replacing the previous promiscuity of different and uncoordinated names for each gene, marks the coherence and maturation of an important field from an initiating chaos of uncoordinated empirical promise.



SEGMENTAL HOMOLOGIES OF ARTHROPODS AND VERTEBRATES: Geoffroy's vindication. The discovery of these deep homologies in genetic structure and action among phyla (particularly between vertebrates and arthropods) brings us back to Geoffroy's daring theory of the vertebral archetype. Researchers have documented homology in key regulatory genes of development, and have also shown the conservation of basic developmen­tal patterns between the two phyla, particularly in differentiation of struc­tures along the A-P axis under the influence of homologous Hox genes and their principles of colinearity. But Geoffroy's formalist theory rests upon an additional and crucial premise — one that continued to strike most research­ers as unlikely, even after the first discovery of these broad commonalities in development. For Geoffroy postulated that the segment (the vertebra in Geoffroy's terminology) represents a fundamental — and truly homological — unit of construction in both phyla. Therefore, to validate the basic premise of Geoffroy's theory, the vertebrate somite must also be homologous with the insect metamere (similar patterns of differentiation along the A-P axis cannot suffice), and such a close comparison seemed exceedingly unlikely, if not anathematic, to most biologists. In the classic pre evo-devo book on the ori­gin of the coelom and segmentation, Clark (1964) described the independent origin of arthropod and vertebrate segments as “universally accepted.” And Moore and Willmer (1997, p. 34) although writing after most of the genetic discoveries discussed in this section, affirmed the independent evolution of segmentation as virtually beyond dispute, and therefore an exemplar and “type case” for good pedagogy in phyletic inference: “As an object lesson to begin with, it is evident . . . that the character we score as 'segmentation' has to have arisen at least twice, since it occurs in the protostome annelid/arthro­pod grouping and again in the very distant deuterostome chordates, but not in any of their possible common ancestors.” (Their confidence, presumably, would only be increased by the subsequent discovery of a fundamental split among the protostome phyla, with arthropods on one branch and annelids on the other — thus implying a third independent origin of segmentation.)

But now, at a dawning millennium in human calendrics, two sequential sets of discoveries have provoked a rethinking even of this most “settled” issue, and some genuine segmental homology between arthropods and vertebrates now seems almost inescapable. No simple one-for-one correspondence of somite with metamere can be specified down the A-P axes of these phyla, and no archetypal form like Geoffroy's “vertebra” can be reconstructed as an an­cestral prototype for all segments. Moreover, vertebrate somites do not seem to be constructed by the arthropod cascade of gap, pair rule, segment polarity genes, etc. — see p. 1110 for more detail on these differences. But anatomi­cal homologies between these two-segmented phyla on maximally divergent boughs of the bilaterian tree extend well beyond mere positioning and pat­tern of A-P differentiation, and also include important aspects of segmenta­tion as well. If the common ancestor of arthropods and vertebrates did not al­ready possess a segmented body, this “urbilaterian” (in the terminology of De Robertis, 1997) had probably established the fundamental genetic pathways behind segmentation and the differentiation and specialization of segments — a system maintained ever since in both phyla, and based in large part on the Hox sequences and their colinearity.



1. REDISCOVERING THE VERTEBRATE RHOMBOMERES. Initial data on the mode of action of vertebrate Hox genes seemed, at first, to support the traditional conclusion that no segmental homology existed between the two phyla. The primary sites of Hox action generally correlate with the anterior expression boundary of each gene — and these boundaries extended past the developing vertebral column into anterior regions of the embryo. Some en­terprising geneticists then rediscovered an important fact, established in the 19th century by the great German school of descriptive anatomists, and then forgotten by several subsequent generations who dismissed such work as the dullest form of cataloguing done at the least causally relevant scale by the most hidebound methodology of holistic observation. For these 19th century anatomists had discovered that the vertebrate hindbrain eventually develops into a unitary structure, but begins as a linear series of 7 or 8 seg­ments called rhombomeres. Moreover, specific rhombomeres seem to control (or at least correlate with) the development of important aspects of anterior anatomy, including the deployment of the cranial nerves. Finally, as the spur to renewed respect for such “trivial” data of gross anatomy, the anterior ex­pression boundaries of several Hox genes map consistently to specific rhom­bomeres.*

The striking similarity between the action of vertebrate Hox in rhombomeres and insect Hox in metameres generates strong suspicions of homology. For example, some vertebrate Hox sequences follow the common in­sect pattern that the anterior expression boundary of each successive 5' gene “skips” a segment, appearing two segments towards the animal's posterior. In mice, Hoxb-2 turns on in the third rhombomere, Hoxb-3 in the fifth, and Hoxb-4 in the seventh. Moreover, cell populations of the rhombomeres seem to follow the same “compartment” rules of insect parasegments — i.e., cells originating before the formation of rhombomere boundaries may place progeny in several rhombomeres, but the clones of all cells formed after the development of a rhombomere boundary do not transgress into adjacent rhombomeres.

These observations may lead a skeptic to admit that some segmental homology exists, but only between the bulk of an arthropod's body and a rela­tively insignificant portion of a vertebrate's anterior end (and not even to the crucial face or forebrain). At this point, however, a key paleontological fact should convert skepticism into strong interest. The rhombomeres of the em­bryonic hindbrain correlate directly with the pharyngeal arches developing just alongside (Fig. 10-16). In fact, each pharyngeal arch corresponds with two rhombomeres (Raff, 1996, p. 343). As we should remember from our el­ementary courses, all early vertebrate embryos develop pharyngeal arches, or gill slits. Tetrapods lose these structures in later embryology, but their posi­tions determine important aspects of embryological topology (including mi­gratory paths of neural crest cells and the subsequent locations of cranial nerves, as mentioned above), while some of their parts transform into impor­tant organs of gnathostome vertebrates. (Most famously, the jaw arises from the first gill arch, while an element of the second arch becomes, in jawed fishes, the hyomandibula (suspending the upper jaw to the braincase) and later, in tetrapods, the stapes, or hearing bone.)

But, more importantly for acknowledging a meaningful segmental homology between arthropods and vertebrates, the rhombomeres and their under­lying Hox codes do not only generate some important features of later tetrapod anatomy. They also constitute, in the earliest agnathan vertebrates, the major functional aspect and structural extent of the organism's segmental anatomy — and not just a small portion of the anterior end. The region of the agnathan gill slits occupied more than half the body's length in many early forms. Moreover, the pharyngeal clefts functioned not only in breathing, but also, as the branchial basket, in gathering and filtering food. In fact, these ear­liest vertebrates may have fed in the manner of many arthropods, by passing food along a series of segments and their appendages, from posterior to ante­rior towards the jawless mouth (rather than in the reverse direction that we know so well from our own experience!). For many of the earliest agnathan vertebrates, and without gross exaggeration, one might be tempted to regard the posterior vertebral column (behind the branchial basket) as an add-on and afterthought. In this historical sense, if insect metameres are homologs of rhombomeres in the developing hindbrain of vertebrates, then segmental homology between the two phyla governs the major primordial system of verte­brate segmentation, even if most later gnathostome clades deemphasized this anterior system and strengthened the somites of the subsequent and posterior vertebral column.



2. MORE EXTENSIVE HOMOLOGIES THROUGHOUT THE DEVELOPING SOMITES. If homologies based on the Hox code place vertebrate rhom­bomeres into phylogenetic union with arthropod metameres, must we con­clude that the far more prominent somites of the gnathostome vertebral col­umn bear no relationship of homology with arthropod segments? Such a conclusion need not follow, for the obvious reason that development and specification of arthropod segments requires the operation of several genetic systems prior to and beyond the activation of Hox genes. The Hox genes, af­ter all, do not regulate the formation, number and timing of segments, and

they do not code for the actual structures built within each segment. The Hox genes turn on after the segments have been generated by other systems. They then act to regulate the appropriate (and different) downstream cascades that actually build the specialized structures of each segment. Thus, we may also search for homologies between vertebrates and arthropods in the prior sys­tems that specify numbers and positions of segments before Hox genes begin their work in regulating specific fates.

Although the long germ-band style of segmentation in Drosophila (all seg­ments forming simultaneously as divisions of an embryo with a fully estab­lished A-P axis) represents a highly derived condition with respect to the plesiomorphic state of most insects (short germ-band development, with new segments added in a temporal sequence, one by one at the posterior end), we almost inevitably turn to Drosophila as an arthropod model of segmentation because our knowledge of this fly so exceeds our understanding of any other arthropod's development. The identities and differentiation of Drosophila's segments occur in a programmed cascade of linked and ever-finer specifica­tions that always draws my mind to the basic model of Genesis I (by which I intend no statement about creation, needless to say, but refer only to the geo­metric style of building complexity by successive division and differentiation out of primal homogeneity, rather than by addition). In this primal tale of Western culture, the cosmos begins “without form and void,” and its prod­ucts then originate by compartmentalization and increasing specification of units: light from darkness on day one; earthly from heavenly waters on day two; earthly land from earthly water on day three; and division of heavenly light into sun and moon on day four.

Drosophila's first specification even begins in a prior generation, for pro­tein products of maternal genes like bicoid and nanos appear in the egg cyto­plasm to designate the anterior and posterior embryonic poles. These mater­nal genes activate gap genes like hunchback that specify broad regions along the A-P axis. Gap genes then regulate the expression of pair-rule genes, whose bands of activity establish the embryo's parasegment boundaries. These pair-rule genes express themselves in every other segment, but also regulate the next level of differentiation in the genetic cascade: segment-polarity genes like engrailed and wingless. The action of segment-polarity genes finally estab­lishes the anterior and posterior domains of each segment. Now that segment boundaries have been set, and the spatial domains of each segment deter­mined, Hox genes can finally establish segment identities by regulating downstream cascades of appropriate architects.

Interestingly, although evidence remains limited to a few taxa and effects as I write this section in January 2000, some apparent vertebrate homologs of these segmental cascades have been detected with reasonable confidence.

(1) Pair-rule genes and somite formation in zebra fish and chicks. Miiller et al. (1996) studied the expression of herl, a homolog of the Drosophila pair-rule gene hairy, in the zebra fish Danio rerio. Expression of herl occurs in transient stipes within the presomitic mesoderm. Although more than 10 bands eventually form, no more than three are expressed at any one time, be­cause older (anterior) bands fade as new bands appear at the tail bud (see de­scription in Kimmel, 1996). Since the her1 bands form and fade before the appearance of somites, Miiller et al. (1996) traced the fate of cells from the her1 bands in later embryos. In a particularly gratifying result, cells of the first herl band formed somite 5, while cells of the second band generated somite 7, thus confirming homology of action for pair-rule genes (expression in every other somite) as well as homology of genetic sequence.

Pennisi (1997) then described the work of Pourquie and colleagues on chairy (for chick hairy), the chick homolog of the same Drosophila pair-rule gene hairy. This study added important data on the timing of gene action, again linking the spatial order along a major body axis to a temporal se­quence that can easily implicate heterochrony, the classical rubric for eluci­dating relationships between ontogeny and phylogeny, as a pathway (and preferred channel) for evolutionary change. The early chick embryo grows an elongated region where about 50 somites will originate, one at a time, start­ing at the anterior end, and taking about 90 minutes for each to form. Pourquie and colleagues found that chairy first becomes active in the rear 70% or so of the entire elongated region. The band of expression then nar­rows and shifts forward towards the head, finally becoming concentrated in a thin stripe at the rear edge of the next somite to form. After this stripe ap­pears, the gene turns on again over the same broad region, beginning the cy­cle anew and ending in a sharp stripe at the next posterior segment in the de­veloping array.

(2) A segment polarity gene in amphioxus. Although vertebrate homologs of arthropod segment polarity genes do not seem to function in establishing segmentation (for their expression begins only after somitic boundaries have formed), AmphiEn, the only amphioxus homolog of the Drosophila segment polarity gene engrailed, appears in stripes at the posterior border of the first eight somites to develop (Holland et al., 1997). (Drosophila engrailed ap­pears in a similar position at the anterior borders of developing parasegments, which become the posterior borders of adult segments, since each final segment forms from the junction of the posterior half of one parasegment with the anterior half of the next parasegment in the A-P array.) Holland et al. (1997, p. 1723) draw a strong inference about segmental homology: “The segmental expression of AmphiEn in forming somites suggests that the func­tions of engrailed homologs in establishing and maintaining a metameric body plan may have arisen only once during animal evolution. If so, the protostomes and deuterostomes probably shared a common segmented an­cestor. “

(3) Does resegmentation occur in developing vertebrae, and could such a process be homologous with the conversion of embryonic insect parasegments to adult segments? As De Robertis (1997) reminds us, anatomical data known for more than a century indicate that a subset of cells in each somite (called the sclerotome) forms a vertebra. But each adult vertebra arises by “resegmentation” as the posterior half of one sclerotome fuses to the anterior half of the next sclerotome along the A-P axis. “The end result is a phase shift of the vertebra with respect to the muscle, so that the segmental muscles can span, and move, adjoining vertebrae” (De Robertis, 1997).

These anatomical data, never satisfactorily verified, have now been con­firmed by cell lineage studies in birds. De Robertis argues that such vertebral resegmentation may be homologous, and not merely analogous, with the sim­ilar construction of insect segments from conjoined halves of adjacent parasegments. De Robertis concludes (1997): “It seems improbable that such a complicated way of making individual metameres would have arisen inde­pendently twice in evolution.”



3. Some caveats and tentative conclusions. I need hardly remind my fellow evolutionary biologists that these results, no matter how fascinat­ing and surprising, show only limited and partial homology, in the strict sense needed to affirm Geoffroy's archetypal notions, between arthropod meta­meres and vertebrate somites. To cite the two most important caveats: First, even the most impressive finding, the mapping of Hox activity to rhombomeres of the developing vertebrate hindbrain, does not establish full ho­mology between particular arthropod and vertebrate segments. We may, I think, legitimately speak of homology in the basic function, and in the spatiotemporal operation of the Hox genes themselves, and therefore in the fun­damental patterning of the A-P axis. But the segments along this axis have already been established by this point in development, and the action of Hox genes (as discussed previously on p. 1107) does not build the segments, but rather turns on downstream cascades that differentiate the “right” structures in the appropriate places.

At this point, we have no evidence for, and some substantial (albeit nega­tive) evidence against, the building of rhombomeres along genetic pathways homologous with those that determine arthropod segments. No data suggest that gap genes, pair-rule genes, and segment polarity genes — the temporal cascades responsible for the development of arthropod segments — also build vertebrate rhombomeres. Thus, in the overall case for homology between ver­tebrate and arthropod segments, the rhombomeres can only claim an archi­tectural status as “preformed” compartments in which a homologous set of genes then operates to regulate the further differentiation of appropriate structures within each segment. But we cannot claim homology in the path­ways of genetic construction for the compartments themselves.

Second, although some impressive homologies may now be asserted for structures along the main A-P axis of arthropods and vertebrates (despite their major differences in adult appearance and function), two important comparisons in Geoffroy's hypothesis cannot, for different reasons, be de­fended as support for strongly constraining homology: The relationship of in­sect appendages with vertebrate limbs, and the interpretation of the verte­brate head as an amalgam of several vertebrae (which might then be viewed as potentially homologous with the arthropod head, construed as a tagma of several segments).

As for limbs, I will argue in the next section (pp. 1134–1142) that the puta­tive homology of some genetic pathways resides in such generalized rules of morphological organization (for the initiation of any “outpouching” or­thogonal to a major axis, for example) that little support for particular his­torical constraints can be drawn from the claim for genetic retention. (After all, properties so pervasive and general as the structure of DNA, or so broad as the necessary physical geometry of elongation and outpouching, do not manifest the specificity required to identify limitations or channels arising from definite historical positions on life's phyletic tree.)

As for the vertebrate head, current knowledge favors a status even less con­genial to claims for homology across phyla, and to strong historical con­straint: interpretation of this definitive vertebrate structure as a true novelty and neomorph, and not as a highly modified organ constructed from parts homologous to units of the arthropod Bauplan. The foundation of this argu­ment rests upon distinctive features of the vertebrate neural crest and its astonishing range of developmental derivatives and influences (Gans and Northcutt, 1983). Thus, despite important homologies in products of the de­veloping hindbrain and its rhombomeres, the vertebrate mid and forebrain seems to represent a largely “suradded” structure, unique to the vertebrate (or at least to the chordate) lineage.

I do not challenge this general argument, but some aspects of the vertebrate fore and midbrain may exhibit developmental homology with anterior seg­mentation in protostome phyla. In particular (see Simeone et al., 1992; Hol­land et al., 1992; and Raff, 1996, pp. 199-200), the Drosophila gap genes orthodenticle (otd) and empty spiracles (ems) operate in the establishment of head segmentation at the fly's front end, anterior to the domain of expression for Hox genes. Two homologs of each of these homeobox genes (Otx1 and 2, and Emx1 and 2) have now been identified in mice, and their domain of ac­tion also maps to the forebrain and midbrain, anterior to the expression of Hox genes in the rhombomeres of the hindbrain (see Fig. 10-17, taken from Holland et al., 1992, p. 627). But we do not yet know if these genes encode common modes of action (in addition to their similarity in genetic structure and locus of operation).

On this chapter's central subject of degrees of constraint, Holland et al. (1992) offer the interesting suggestion that these gap gene homologies might enforce less channeling upon patterns of development than the Hox genes im­pose, and that the greater independence, flexibility and subsequent novelty and variety of the vertebrate head might flow, in part, from the absence of more constraining Hox action in the mid and forebrain regions. (In particu­lar, as Figure 10-17 illustrates, “the four Otx and Emx genes show a nested series of posterior expression boundaries, in contrast to clearly nested ante­rior expression boundaries in the Hox genes” (Holland et al., 1992, p. 627.) Moreover, whereas the anatomical expression of Hox genes strictly parallels their spatial order on the chromosome, Otx and Emx show no evidence for similar clustering in the genome). Holland et al. (1992, p. 628) therefore hy­pothesize:

If roles for Hox, Otx and Emx genes in body regionalization evolved early in metazoan radiation, the fundamental molecular dichotomy within the vertebrate neural tube is a legacy from events preceding the evolution of the vertebrate head; nonetheless, there are likely to be adap­tive consequences. If the different homeobox gene families are under dif­ferent modes of regulation (for example if the tight clustering of Hox genes restricts mutational change) then subsequent variation and adap­tive radiation will have been constrained to different extents anterior and posterior of the midbrain/hindbrain boundary. We suggest this could be a molecular basis for the comparative evolutionary plasticity of the vertebrate forebrain and midbrain, but conservation of hindbrain mor­phology, during vertebrate evolution.



Lumsden and Krumlauf (1996) discuss another prospect for potential homology in genetic action at the anterior end of arthropods and vertebrates (although such examples, as for the previous case of Otx and Emx, bear lim­ited application to Geoffroy's particular theory about the segmental basis of

anatomical homology, because any similar action occurs within segments at an arthropod's frontal end, but operates within the apparently unsegmented mid and forebrain of developing vertebrates). In the chick midbrain, rostral to the anterior limit of Hox action, a long-range signaling region, located at the isthmic constriction between the posterior end of the midbrain and the rhombomeres behind, regulates AP patterning within the unsegmented field of the developing midbrain. Signals from this isthmus regulate the action of En-1 and En-2, two engrailed genes homologous with the prominent seg­ment-polarity engrailed gene of Drosophila. In chicks, the engrailed gradient (see Fig. 10-18) spreads from the isthmus in both directions, decreasing ante­riorly through the mesencephalic vesicle and also posteriorly through the first rhombomere (Lumsden and Krumlauf, 1996, p. 1112). Moreover, these authors add (p. 1112), “En expression is the earliest known marker for mesen­cephalic polarity.”

Finally, although this argument only applies to the relationship of verte­brates with other chordates, and not to any protostome group, the forebrain, and even the neural crest, may not be so confined to true vertebrates as pre­vious views generally assumed. In overt appearance, the anterior end of amphioxus does not include any organs comparable with the vertebrate mid or forebrain. But Holland and Holland (1998) report that amphioxus homologs of two genes with important action in the vertebrate fore and midbrain also operate in generating the anteriormost cerebral structures of amphioxus. (AmphiOtx, the homolog of the vertebrate Otx that operates in both fore and midbrain, is expressed at the anterior end, and in the ventral and lateral walls, of the cerebral vesicle in amphioxus. AmphiDll, the homolog of vertebrate Dlx that operates in the forebrain, is expressed at the extreme anterior end of the cerebral vesicle, and also in the dorsal wall.)

Holland and Holland conclude (1998, p. 651) “the expression pat­terns of these amphioxus genes suggest that the cerebral vesicle is largely ho­mologous to the vertebrate forebrain, but cannot rule out a midbrain homo-log.” Moreover, the expression pattern of AmphiDll during neurulation implies “that the epidermal cells bordering the neural plate may represent a

phylogenetic precursor of the vertebrate neural crest” (p. 648). Nonetheless, emphasizing the novelty of vertebrate usage, whatever the homology of de­velopment with amphioxus, “the migrating cells of amphioxus do not differ­entiate into the wide variety of cell types known to originate from the verte­brate neural crest, but eventually remain part of the epidermis” (Holland and Holland, 1998, p. 654).

Despite these caveats, we can only conclude that the first fruits of evo-devo have revealed some remarkable, and extensive, homology in both genetic structure and action among animal phyla (particularly between arthropods and chordates, the former prototypes of separation in our traditions and liter­ature), and that these data have confirmed some important aspects of the most ridiculed formalist theory of constraint in the history of morphological and evolutionary thought: Geoffroy's claim for homology between vertebrate and arthropod segments, with the idealized segment itself regarded as the ba­sic unit of generation.

The history of our dawning realization — as expressed in an acknowledg­ment that this heresy of homology between phyla must be reclothed in mod­ern genetic language as a partial reality — also followed an interesting path­way of strong reluctance gradually yielding to bemused acceptance of ever widening scope. From the initial Mayrian stance of near theoretical impossi­bility for recognizable genetic homology, we first admitted (with the discov­ery of vertebrate Hox genes) that footprints of common ancestry could be preserved during more than 500 million years and such substantial anatomi­cal divergence. But we still doubted that such genetic resemblances could con­tinue to encode phenotypic homologies in these disparate phyla. Then, in a second step, we acknowledged the potential homology of Hox action in gen­eral spatial organization along the A-P axis, but still declined to accept any common basis for segmentation in arthropods and vertebrates (the key to Geoffroy's hypothesis).

In a third stage, the similarity of Hox action in patterning vertebrate rhombomeres and arthropod segments demonstrated at least some homology between modes of differentiation in arthropod segments and in the compart­mentalized organization of the vertebrate hindbrain and its extensive deriva­tives. In a fourth stage, researchers then discovered some partial and limited homologies in earlier determinants of segmentation itself (pair-rule and seg­ment-polarity genes) between arthropods and some aspects of segmental de­velopment in the main vertebrate body axis posterior to the rhombomeres.

In short, and in a story to be, no doubt, extensively continued (expanded, contracted, changed, reinterpreted, etc.), Geoffroy's theory of complete and overarching homology based on a common vertebral archetype surely will not prevail in anything like its original form. But this most ridiculed of all heresies, so contrary in principle to strict Darwinian expectations of the Modern Synthesis, and so widely dismissed as a romantic delusion until just a few years ago, has now resurfaced, in appropriately revised terms, as a pri­mary, and initially surprising example of the unanticipated durability of an­cient genetic pathways, and of their continuing power to constrain the subsequent phylogeny of life along broad and fruitful (but still limited) routes of wonderfully diverse, but historically rule-bound, adaptive designs.





GEOFFROY'S SECOND ARCHETYPAL THEORY OF DORSO-VENTRAL IN­VERSION OF THE COMMON BILATERIAN GROUNDPLAN. The ridicule heaped upon Geoffroy's second archetypal theory for homologizing arthro­pods and vertebrates did not descend entirely from his genuine and original argument, but from an explicitly phyletic version championed by later evolu­tionists, but never intended by Geoffroy himself. (Geoffroy maintained a gen­erally supportive attitude towards an evolutionary world view, and even gave his name to a theory of causation that he did advocate in passing, but never really developed in extenso — the idea that soft inheritance could operate by immediate impress of external conditions upon parts of organisms, yield­ing inheritable changes directly, rather than by the more indirect route of Lamarckian organic response to “felt needs.” In fact, late 19th century discussions of evolutionary mechanisms often listed three primary contenders: Darwinism for the theory of natural selection, Lamarckism for soft inheri­tance by organic response, and so-called “Geoffroyism” for soft inheritance following direct imposition. In this light of Geoffroy's positive attitude to evolution, his failure to cite, as support for transmutation, his archetypal theory of dorsoventral inversion between insects and vertebrates provides strong evidence that he did not intend this anatomical comparison to be read in a phylogenetic context.)

After resolving (to his satisfaction) the common structure of vertebrate and arthropod segmentation, and dealing with the inconvenient fact, for a hy­pothesis of homology, that vertebrates grow internal hard parts and arthro­pods an exoskeleton (see pp. 304-306 for Geoffroy's ingenious, and glori­ously wrong, resolution), Geoffroy moved to a second archetypal theory for the outstanding remaining difference in basic anatomy between the phyla: their apparently reversed dorsoventral orientations — for the two main nerve cords of arthropods run along the ventral surface below the central gut, while the single nerve tube of vertebrates runs along the dorsal surface, above the gut. As we all learned in Biology 1 (but usually not with proper respect or understanding for Geoffroy's interesting conjecture), Geoffroy resolved this striking difference by suggesting that the same groundplan underlay the de­velopment of both phyla, but that this common design appeared in reversed orientation, with arthropods interpreted as, essentially, vertebrates turned on their backs (see Fig. 10-19).

We also learned, quite correctly — for Geoffroy's supporters never resolved this issue with any plausibility — that such a reversal scarcely brings the two phyla into complete correspondence. In the knottiest remaining difficulty, the front end of the arthropod gut passes between the nerve cords and emerges on the lower surface as a ventral mouth. In an overturned position, the verte­brate mouth should therefore pass by the dorsal nerve cord and emerge on the upper surface. But vertebrate mouths are also ventral. So Geoffroy weakly argued that the mouths of the two phyla are not homologous — and that the original mouth, which would have opened dorsally in vertebrates, simply closed up, while a separate ventral mouth originated as a neomorph.

This history, discussed extensively in Chapter 4, becomes crucially relevant to the modern validation of Geoffroy's own centerpiece for his theory of dorsoventral inversion. I must also address this question in the largely non-historical second half of this book because later exegetes have seriously mis­represented Geoffroy's intent by substituting a later phyletic version that modern research in evo-devo rightly rejects — and that, if conflated with Geoffroy's actual theory, will lead to continued and unjustified dismissal of his second, and remarkably ingenious, archetypal formulation.

In short, Geoffroy never advanced (and, I suspect, never even conceptual­ized) a historical argument about direct evolutionary transformation: the claim that vertebrates evolved from arthropods when an ancestral trilobite or merostome literally flipped upside down during its phyletic ascent. However, the American morphologist William Patten did popularize such an evolution­ary account in arguing that the first prominent group of putative fossil verte­brates, the jawless “ostracoderms,” did not belong to a completed vertebrate line, but represented an intermediate stage between arthropods and fishes along the “great highway of organic evolution” (his words, see Patten, 1912, 1920), with the transition literally achieved by anatomical inversion, as an ar­thropod that swam on its back settled to the bottom, thus converting its origi­nal dorsal side to a new belly. (The ostracoderms, with their external plates,

do resemble, but by convergence, the eurypterid arthropods in several fea­tures of external form and function.)

For Geoffroy, however, the inversion of axes between vertebrates and arthropods does not denote an evolutionary transition in either direction, but represents instead (as the archetypal mode of thinking would imply) two op­posite specializations upon a shared abstract groundplan that generated both great phyla along predictable pathways of internally specified laws of form and their permissible transformations.

As a structuralist thinker, committed to a formal, rather than a functional, approach to the explanation of organic design and variation, Geoffroy ar­gued that the apparently fundamental difference in disposition of organs be­tween arthropods and vertebrates should be reconceptualized as both second­ary and superficial — a consequence of opposite ecological orientations for the same archetypal structure. The shared and constraining pattern specifies a central gut and a peripheral major channel for the nervous system, both ori­ented parallel to the body's A-P axis. Vertebrates, so to speak (and befitting their higher status and dignity), have oriented their main nerve tract upwards toward the sun and surface, while the humbler arthropods have directed the same peripheral aspect of archetypal form downward towards the earth and ocean bottom.

A functional theory, like Darwinian natural selection, would tend to inter­pret this ecological correlation as a primary impetus for the later evolutionary fixation of these two opposite arrangements. But to a structuralist thinker like Geoffroy, the same ecological situation becomes both derivative and tem­porally consequential (not to mention ideologically inconsequential as well). The established differences represent a realized subset of possible transforma­tions for an archetypal form under structurally determined rules of geometric constraint and possibility. The happenstance of opposite ecological orienta­tion for a common archetypal design only records a later adaptive overlay — a diversity of form arising for structural reasons and then finding both an ap­propriate suite of functions and the right environments for their realization. Thus, in Geoffroy's view, the inversion of dorsoventral axes in arthropods vs. vertebrates does not validate a direct flip of evolutionary transformation, but rather represents two separately developed expressions of a common ar­chetypal structure, one oriented up towards the sun, the other down towards the earth, in a secondary ecological specialization that can only obscure an underlying, and truly ruling, unity of constrained design.

The modern version of Geoffroy's vision — so different in genetic and evo­lutionary (as opposed to formal and archetypal) evidence, yet so eerily similar in philosophical style (as a structuralist account based on internal channels of transformational constraint) — originated in the mid 1990's based on unantic­ipated discoveries of genetic homology in genes that operate in patterning dorsal and ventral surfaces and structures in Drosophila and Xenopus. (See Sasai, et al., 1994; Holley et al., 1995; and De Robertis and Sasai, 1996, for the pioneering work of De Robertis's lab at UCLA, and Francois et al., 1994; and Francois and Bier, 1995, for studies of similar import from Bier's lab at the University of California, San Diego. See also the general commentary of Hogan, 1995; De Robertis, 1997; and Gould, 1997c.)

The chordin (chd) gene of Xenopus codes for a protein that operates in patterning the dorsal side of the developing embryo, and also plays an important role in formation of the dorsal nerve cord. But sog, the homolog of chd in Drosophila, is expressed on the ventral side of the developing larva, where it acts to induce the formation of ventral nerve cords. Thus, the same gene by evolutionary ancestry acts in the development of both the dorsal nerve tube in vertebrates and the ventral nerve cords in Drosophila — in conformity with Geoffroy's old claim that the two phyla can be brought into structural corre­spondence by inversion.

Two further discoveries then promoted this intriguing hint into a strong case. First, major gene acting in development and specification of the dorsal surface in flies (decapentaplegic, or dpp) has a vertebrate homolog (Bmp-4) that patterns the ventral side of Xenopus. Moreover, the entire system seems to operate in a similar manner — but inverted — in the two phyla. That is, dpp, diffusing from the top to the bottom, can antagonize sog and suppress the formation of the ventral nerve cords in Drosophila — while Bmp-4 (the ho­molog of dpp) diffusing from the bottom to the top, can antagonize chordin (the homologue of sog) and suppress the formation of the dorsal nerve cord in vertebrates (see Fig. 10-20).

Second, the fly genes work in vertebrates, and vice versa. Vertebrate chordin can induce the formation of central nerve tissue in flies, while fly sog can induce dorsal nerve tissue in vertebrates. These three discoveries, taken

together, offer strong support for a modern recasting of Geoffroy's old theory of inversion.

These studies have aroused considerable excitement and controversy, and a substantial set of alternative interpretations has been proposed. But, in my judgment, some of these objections attack the wrong target (Patten's hypothe­sis of direct evolutionary transition, not Geoffroy's argument for common structural design), while others raise legitimate questions of an interesting and fundamental nature, although not yet resolvable by information now in hand. To cite a most cogent example in each category:

Jacobs et al. (1998) compare the neural organization of arthropods and vertebrates to a platyhelminth outgroup bearing a potentially plesiomorphic design: “The flatworm nervous system is often conceived of as having an anterior nerve ring with four major nerves emanating posteriorly from it” (1998, p. 348). They then point out, citing Bier (1997), that “the default con­dition of the ectoderm is neurectoderm” (p. 349), and that the development of non-neural ectoderm therefore requires additional and apomorphic down-regulation, now largely accomplished, in vertebrates and arthropods, by the chd/sog and dpp/BMP-4 systems described above. Jacobs et al. (1998) there­fore interpret the relatively inverted systems of neural development in arthro­pods and vertebrates as two different specializations from the plesiomorphic (flatworm) condition of four major nerves extending posteriorly in radial symmetry around the anterior ring. Thus, arthropods retain the two ventral cords (and suppress dorsal neurectoderm by dpp action described above), whereas vertebrates keep the plesiomorphic state in a dorsal position and suppress ventral neurectoderm by the action of BMP-4. Jacobs et al. (1998, pp. 349-350) conclude: “The bilaterian central nervous system would be the product of concentrating the nervous organization in part of the ectoderm, by eliminating it from other regions ... If this were the case, then the ventral ner­vous system in protostomes could derive from the ventral pair of nerves in the orthogon [the fourfold system of flatworms] and the dorsal system in verte­brates from the dorsal pair.”

So far so good, and so reasonable. But Jacobs et al. (1998, p. 350) then make a false inference about Geoffroy's views: “The above scenario explains the available data without invoking an instantaneous dorsoventral inversion as envisioned in the transcendental scheme of Geoffroy.” But Jacobs et al., while correctly criticizing Patten's theory of flipover in direct phyletic transi­tion, misattribute this view to Geoffroy. In fact, the scenario of Jacobs et al. fits splendidly with Geoffroy's actual hypothesis of separate and different transformation, constrained by structural rules of growth, from a common archetype — in this particular case, suppression of either the two dorsal, or the two ventral, nerve cords in an originally radially symmetrical circlet of four. (Gerhart, 2000, questions the inversion hypothesis with an alternative strik­ingly similar to the proposal of Jacobs et al., but equally, and truly, consonant with Geoffroy's actual claim.)

In a different potential criticism, Bang et al. (2000) accept the description of homologous systems of neural generators and suppressors operating at opposite poles of the dorsoventral axis in arthropods and vertebrates. But they question the status of this system as an ancient and conserved primary marker and definition of the body axis throughout the history of bilaterian animals, from the time of the ancestral “urbilaterian” (De Robertis and Sasai, 1996) through the differentiation of arthropods, vertebrates, and all other phyla deriving from this common node.

Perhaps, they argue, the dpp/sog and BMP-4/chd interaction expresses a much more general (and perhaps more ancient) signaling pathway “that has been conserved in evolution but coopted for patterning very different aspects of the body” (Bang et al., 2000, p. 23). In potential support, they note (see Yu et al., 1996) that, in Drosophila, “dpp is expressed in vein precursor cells in the pupa, whereas sog is expressed in the intervein-cells and suppresses the formation of veins.” The separate cooption, in arthropods and vertebrates, but in reversed orientation, of such a general signaling pathway would repre­sent a parallelism based on so broad and abstract a homology of underlying genetic routes of development that an evolutionary interpretation in terms of constraint would become uninformative because the “hold of history” would then become so loose and unspecific. (I shall devote the entire second part of the next section — pp. 1134–1142 — to this central issue, by elucidating the contrast between the genuine but uninteresting homology of Pharaonic bricks and the important historical mark and constraint of Corinthian columns. I will therefore let this example stand as a prelude to this forthcoming discus­sion, while also adding an incisive comment from Wray and Lowe (2000, p. 48): “The existence of developmental modules that are reapplied in func­tionally similar contexts in nonhomologous structures poses a very real prob­lem for testing hypotheses of homology among morphological structures.”)

For now — and so much more shall be discovered in the first years of our new millennium — we may recapitulate the stunning novelty of this first theme by contrasting Mayr's conventional 1963 statement that genetic homology between phyla may be dismissed a priori and in principle, based on our gen­eral understanding of the power of natural selection, with a 1996 statement by Kimmel (p. 329), not at all intended as a “gotcha” or an ironic commen­tary on Mayr's misplaced confidence, but certainly appropriate as an opening sentence for a 1996 article on a new view of life: “We have come to find it more remarkable to learn that a homolog of our favorite regulatory gene in a mouse is not, in fact, present in Drosophila than if it is, given the large degree of evolutionary conservation in developmentally acting genes.”





Movement two, Elaboration: parallelism of underlying generators:

Deep homology builds positive channels of constraint




PARALLELISM ALL THE WAY DOWN: SHINING A LIGHT AND FEEDING THE WALK. The deep homologies discussed in the last section operate as shared starting points and subsequent conduits for historically constrained change. But, in an even more positive role for the historical shaping of evo­lution from within, homologous developmental pathways can also be employed (and deployed) as active facilitators of homoplastic adaptations that might otherwise be very difficult, if not impossible, to construct in such a strikingly similar form from such different starting points across such im­mense phyletic gaps. In short, this fascinating evolutionary phenomenon, long discussed under the rubric of convergence in our literature, now stands ripe for reinterpretation, in several key cases, as the positively constrained outcome of remarkable homologies in underlying pathways of genetic and developmental construction.

This general shift in viewpoint — from a preference for atomistic adaptationism (favoring the explanation of each part as an independent and rela­tively unconstrained event of crafting by natural selection for current utility) to a recognition that homologous developmental pathways (retained from a deep and different past, whatever the original adaptive context) strongly shape current possibilities “from the inside” — has permeated phylogenetic studies at all levels, from similarities among the most disparate phyla to di­versity among species within small monophyletic segments of life's tree. No case has received more attention, generated more surprise, rested upon firmer data, or so altered previous “certainties,” than the discovery of an important and clearly homologous developmental pathway underlying the ubiquitous and venerable paradigm of convergence in our textbooks: the independent evolution of image-forming lens eyes in several phyla, with the stunning ana­tomical similarities of single-lens eyes in cephalopods and vertebrates as the most salient illustration. As Tomarev et al. (1997, p. 2421) write: “The com­plex eyes of cephalopod molluscs and vertebrates have been considered a classical example of convergent evolution.” (Assertions of anatomical con­vergence remain valid in the restricted domain of final products, whereas a phenomenon of opposite theoretical import now holds sway for the pathway of construction itself.)





PARALLELISM IN THE LARGE: PAX-6 AND THE HOMOLOGY OF DEVELOPMENTAL PATHWAYS IN HOMOPLASTIC EYES OF SEVERAL PHYLA



Data and discovery. Salvini-Plawen and Mayr (1977), in a classical article nearly always cited in this context, argued that photoreceptors of some form have evolved independently some 40 to 60 times among animals, with six phyla developing complex image-forming eyes, ranging from cubomedusoids among the Cnidaria, through annelids, onychophores, arthropods and mollusks to vertebrates along the conventional chain of life. In the early 1990's, using Drosophila probes, researchers cloned a family of mamma­lian Pax genes, most notably Pax-6, which includes both a paired box and a homeobox (Walther and Gruss, 1991). Soon thereafter, several recognized mutations in the form and function of eyes were traced to alterations in Pax-6. For example, mice heterozygous for Small eye (Sey) have reduced eyes, whereas lethal homozygotes, before their death, develop neither eyes nor nose. Similarly, human Aniridia (An) causes reduced eyes, sometimes lacking the iris, in heterozygote form, while the lethal homozygotes also develop no eyes at all. Further studies then demonstrated expression of Pax-6 in the spinal cord, several parts of the brain, and especially in the morphogenesis of vertebrate eyes, “first in the optic sulcus, then in the optic vesicle, the pigmented and the neural retina, the iris, in the lens and finally in the cornea” (Gehring, 1996, p. 12).

Although the existence of a Drosophila homolog could certainly have been anticipated — the Pax genes, after all, were found with fly probes — few re­searchers expected that a Drosophila version would also function in the same basic way. But the Drosophila Pax-6 homolog mapped to the eyeless (ey) lo­cus (Quiring, et al., 1994), named for a mutation discovered early in the 20th century, and producing, in homozygous state, flies with strongly reduced eyes, or lacking eyes entirely. Moreover, the conservation between mamma­lian and insect Pax-6 sequences is impressively high, with 94 percent amino acid identity in the paired box and 90 percent in the homeobox (Gehring, 1996).

The similar function of these Pax-6 homologs in different phyla was then dramatically affirmed by expressing the mouse gene in Drosophila (Haider et al., 1995), and finding that the mammalian version could still induce the for­mation of normal fly eyes. Noting that Pax-6 acts as an upstream regulator of a large set of more specific genes, Gehring (1996, p. 14) makes the obvious, but important, point: “Of course, the eyes that are induced by the mouse gene are Drosophila compound eyes, since the mouse gene is only the switch gene and another 2500 genes from Drosophila are required to assemble an eye.”

In the boldest of all experiments, leading to results that attracted substan­tial and well-deserved public attention, Gehring and colleagues then found that ectopic expression of either the murine or Drosophila version of Pax-6 could induce supernumerary eyes on the antennae, legs and wings of flies (Fig. 10-21), thus supporting Gehring's designation of Pax-6 as a “master control gene” for the development of eyes. Gehring (1996, p. 13) wrote that these “ectopic eyes are morphologically normal with normal photoreceptors,

lens, cone and pigment cells and an electroretinogram as it is typical for photoreceptor cells can be recorded, when the ectopic eyes are exposed to light.” Nonetheless, as these ectopic eyes are not neurologically “wired up,” the fly presumably cannot use them for vision. (To give some sense of the ex­citement and weirdness of these results upon their initial discovery — for we have, a mere five years later, already become accustomed to such findings — I include as Fig. 10-22 the “Post-it” note that Gehring penciled when he sent me his first reprint announcing this achievement.)

But this conserved developmental pathway for insect and vertebrate eyes, however surprising in the light of previous assumptions about the impossibil­ity of such genetic homology between phyla, did not yet directly address the theoretical issue of convergence in evolution. After all, the single-lens eye of vertebrates bears little anatomical similarity to the multifaceted fly eye, and no claims for convergence had been staked upon this case. But the discovery





10-22. A personal touch expressing the excitement of this discovery: when Gehring sent me his 1996 reprint on inducing ectopic fly eyes with mouse genes, he inserted this Post-it just above his finding that the ectopic eyes are morpho­logically normal and react to light in the normal way. I added the marginal nota­tion — not to pour water on a great discovery — that these eyes are not wired to the brain and therefore will not function.





of a homologous developmental pathway for the disparate eyes of two such different phyla raised an obvious question about the generality of Pax-6 as a “master control gene” (using Gehring's phrase again) for all complex eyes, in­cluding the “paradigm for convergent evolution” (Gehring, 1996, p. 14): the remarkable similarities in function and structure between the single-lens eyes of vertebrates and cephalopods.

This case has persisted as a classic, ever since the formulation of conver­gence as a concept, because the two eyes look so much alike, and work so similarly, despite their separate origins from different tissues: the vertebrate eye as an evagination of the brain, and the cephalopod eye by invagination of the epidermis. The squid eye forms from a monolayer of epidermis that be­comes thickened, multilayered and internalized on the dorsal side of the head lobe. The outer ectodermal layer forms the iris and the outer lens portion, while the inner half of the lens arises from the inner ectodermal layer. Thus, the adult lens contains two parts, divided by a septum. Meanwhile, the cor­nea, also of ectodermal origin, derives from a quite different source on the edge of the arms, as they grow forward. In vertebrates, by contrast, the optic vesicle arises as an evagination of the diencephalon, whereas the lens then develops from overlying ectoderm. As the most interesting consequence of these differences — well known, perhaps, because the vertebrate eye seems more “jury-rigged” than the eye of the conventionally “inferior” squid on this ba­sis — the polarity of photoreceptors becomes inverted in vertebrates, but re­mains everted (an apparently superior design) in cephalopods.

In a keenly anticipated result, Tomarev et al. (1997) found a homolog of vertebrate and arthropod Pax-6 in the squid Loligo opalescens. This gene is expressed in the development of the embryonic eyes, olfactory organs, brain and arms. (This common expression in visual and olfactory systems bears further study, especially given the common ectodermal origin of both organs in vertebrates and their embryonic interaction with adjacent regions of the

developing brain.) In the most satisfying result (see Fig. 10-23), ectopic ex­pression of squid Pax-6 also induced supernumerary eyes in Drosophila. Tomarev et al. write (1997, p. 2424): “Squid Pax-6 is able to induce ectopic Drosophila eyes on wings, antennae, and legs, as was previously demon­strated for Drosophila eyeless and mouse Pax-6. All Drosophila eye-specific structures including cornea, pigment cells, cone cells and photoreceptors with rhabdomeres were formed in the ectopic eyes induced by squid Pax-6 DNA.”



Theoretical Issues. Two related questions have dominated the emerging discussion of these Pax-6 homologies: the putative status of this gene as a “master control” for eyes, and the impact of Pax-6 upon the claim for independent evolution of eyes by convergence. Gehring (1996, 1998) bases his terminology of “master control” upon three properties of Pax-6: its status as upstream regulator of a substantial cascade of more specific eye-forming gene products; its interchangeability among phyla, while always act­ing as a trigger to the downstream production of the “right” eyes for any given animal; and its general ability to trigger the formation of supernumer­ary eyes in odd places.

We may legitimately quibble, as Jacobs et al. (1998) and many others have done, that upstream position in a cascade should not be equated with ei­ther causal or temporal primacy, for novel regulatory elements can be intro­duced by evolution into any position of a developing sequence. Nonetheless, I would not begrudge a researcher the right to bestow an incisive name upon such an important discovery. Pax-6 may be no more important than hun­dreds of other genes in the sense that usable eyes will not form, absent its nor­mal operation. But the designation, as “master control,” of such early and such general action (including the key property of interchangeability among phyla) does no violence to ordinary linguistic usage.

However, this very generality raises the crucial issue (see forthcoming pages for a fuller discussion) of whether the action of Pax-6 must then be regarded as too broad and too universal to sustain any argument for meaningful con­straint upon the evolution of eyes in disparate phyla. After all, if activating Pax-6 represents little more than flicking on a master switch at the power plant (with animal development than analogized to the operation of any elec­trical device thereafter), then its admittedly necessary action fails to identify any channel of development specific enough to warrant designation as a dedi­cated impetus for the evolution of one adaptive solution over other attainable possibilities. However, in this case (but not in others, as I shall argue on pp. 1034–1042), the actions of Pax-6 are sufficiently specific and precise to set a definite channel among conceivable alternatives, and not just to open a floodgate through which subsequent cascades might flow in any direction (see discussion of this point and listing of criteria for specificity by Jacobs et al., 1998, p. 334, who conclude that this “documentation of eye homology was quite a coup”).

This acknowledgment of sufficient specificity for Pax-6 then raises a final question about the extent of revision thus required in evolutionary concepts of convergence vs. constraint. Some enthusiasts have claimed that genetic homology in such a crucial and early-acting developmental pathway requires a wholesale reinterpretation of this classic convergence as a pure case of par­allel evolution based upon underlying constraint. For example, Tomarev et al. (1997, p. 2426) end their important paper on squid Pax-6 by stating: “Our data support the idea that morphologically distinct eyes of different species have arisen through elaboration of a common conserved Pax-6-dependent mechanism that is operative at early stages of eye development and that the anatomical differences among eyes arose later in evolution. Consequently, we believe that eyes in cephalopods and vertebrates have a common evolutionary origin and are products of parallel rather than convergent evolution.”

This question would be unresolvable, and would become a source of end­less terminological wrangling if a single and exclusive answer — either inde­pendent adaptations by convergence or similar solutions by constraints of parallelism — had to emerge as the explanation for a unitary phenomenon. (Several participants in the developing debate have operated upon just such a contentious assumption, hence the need for explicit treatment of this emi­nently resolvable question.) But the issue of how evolution can generate such similar and highly complex eyes in disparate phyla requires an invocation of both phenomena at different levels of analysis. The conventional view of con­vergence cannot be denied for the final products of adult anatomy, as docu­mented in my previous discussion of the fascinating differences in form and developmental origin for the strikingly similar eyes of cephalopods and verte­brates. But the traditional claim for exclusive convergence at all scales implies a purely functional explanation, positing an independent evolution of eyes along entirely separate and internally unconstrained sequences of natural se­lection, with no aid from any common starting point or channel of develop­ment.

However, the Pax-6 story has now furnished an important homological ba­sis in underlying developmental pathways for generating complex eyes in cephalopods and vertebrates. Thus, a channel of inherited internal constraint has strongly facilitated the resulting, nearly identical solution in two phyla, and evolutionists can no longer argue that such similar eyes originated along entirely separate routes, directed only by natural selection, and without bene­fit of any common channel of shared developmental architecture. But just as the advocates of pure convergence erred in claiming exclusive rights of expla­nation, the discovery of Pax-6 homologies does not permit a complete flip to exclusive explanation by constraint.

As so often happens in our world of biological hierarchy, convergence pre­vails at one level, and constraint at another. The similarities in adult anatomy are primarily convergent, but Pax-6 establishes an important homology in underlying pathways of generation. We thus encounter a case of homoplasy in final results based upon significant homology in underlying developmental architecture. As discussed extensively on pages 1061–1089, and as presented in tabular form on page 1078, this common circumstance, however muddled by a century of confusion in our literature, nevertheless enjoys a clear and simple solution in proper formulation of the concept of parallelism, or homoplasy of results based on homology of underlying generators. This recasting of the paradigm case for pure convergence as an outcome of substantial par­allelism in a key developmental channel has now highlighted the neglected role of constraint as a strongly positive force in organismic adaptation. For we must now grant strong probability to the proposition that, absent an “in­ternal” direction supplied by the preexisting Pax-6 developmental channel, natural selection could not have crafted such exquisitely similar, and beauti­fully adapted, final products from scratch, and purely “from the outside.”

Moreover, two studies published after my initial composition of this sec­tion strongly reinforce the increasing emphasis on constraint and parallelism, rather than independent adaptation and convergence, in the evolution of complex eyes in widely separated phyla of animals. First, Pineda et al. (2000) report homologs of both Pax-6 and sine oculis in the planarian Girardia tigrina. These genes operate in the same cascade, with Pax-6 directly regulat­ing sine oculis, as in phyla with complex lens eyes. But the much simpler vi­sual system of Girardia includes no lens. Pineda et al. (2000, p. 4525) write: “The eye spots of planarians are one of the most ancestral and simple types of visual systems, close to the prototypic eye proposed by Charles Darwin. The planarian eye spots consist of two cell types: a bipolar nerve cell with a rhabdomere as a photoreceptive structure and a cup-shaped structure com­posed of pigment cells.”

Thus, the basic genetic cascade had already originated, and already regu­lated visual systems, before the evolution of complex lens eyes, indicating the preexistence of the developmental pathway as a positive constraint of paral­lelism. Pineda et al. show that repression of the sine oculis homolog com­pletely suppresses the development of eyes in regenerating planarians, thus demonstrating commonality of function as well as structure in the develop­mental genetics of some of the simplest and most complex eyes among dispa­rate animal phyla.

Second, and from the other end of the logic of the general argument, fur­ther aspects of underlying developmental homology have been found in the general construction of anatomically divergent lens eyes of arthropods and vertebrates — so the evidentiary basis of parallelism now extends well beyond the Pax-6 system itself. Neumann and Nusslein-Volhard (2000) show that the retinas of both Drosophila and zebra fish are patterned by a morphogenetic wave of strikingly similar form and timing — driven by Hedgehog in Drosophila and by its homolog Sonic Hedgehog in zebra fish — both inducing a cascade of neurogenesis across the retina. The strikingly unexpected finding of this additional homology in patterning for such anatomically different products led the authors to conclude (2000, p. 2139):

Analysis of the Pax6/Eyeless gene has indicated that the mechanism of eye induction may be conserved across the animal kingdom. However, the dramatic variation of the eye structure not only between vertebrates and invertebrates, but also within the vertebrate lineage, has suggested that events downstream of eye induction may have evolved independently. Our results show that the role played by Hh signalling in retinal differentiation is conserved between flies and fish. This suggests that Hh was already used to pattern a primordial eye structure before vertebrate and invertebrate eye lineages diverged, and thus supports a common evolutionary origin of the animal eye.





A question OF priority. This emerging story of Pax-6 homologies directly engages one of the classic conundrums of macroevolutionary theory, an issue that troubled Darwin himself, and that elicited a famous treatment — based, in a fascinating but not really surprising coincidence, upon the evolu­tion of eyes! — in one of the Origin's most brilliant passages (in Chapter 6, en­titled “Difficulties on Theory”): how can “organs of extreme perfection” ever arise if crucial components of the final product could not have functioned in their current manner in any conceivable ancestral form of simpler design? Darwin's general answer established the important evolutionary principle of cooptation: the component in question must have originally functioned in an­other, perhaps related, manner, and then been coopted for its current role (see pp. 1218–1224 for full treatment).

But this general solution then engendered a second problem of even broader import: how can a trend towards a highly complex organ ever get started at all, if the initial stages can bear so little structural or functional sim­ilarity to the final product? In this case, how could eyes ever form if the sim­plest incipient state in the founding member of a trend couldn't function for anything even roughly analogous to vision? (How, in other words, can evolu­tion ever take the first step to a simple light-sensing organ, not to mention the much later development of image-forming devices?) How can evolution “know” where to start when faced with millions of potentially alterable mol­ecules and processes, none manifesting even the first selected step of a forthcoming trend? (Natural selection may power the trend after step one has been reached, but how can this initial entrance be effected?)

To resolve this deeper problem, Darwin advanced the brilliant hypothe­sis — in the sense of a wonderfully simple idea once formulated, but quite nonobvious beforehand — that first steps must rely upon purely fortuitous variation, or fortuitous cooptability, in the favorable direction. Writing of Batesian mimicry in butterflies, for example, Darwin notes that the adaptive value of a tasty mimic to a noxious model cannot be gainsaid, but what, he then asks, can get the process started? Why, in particular, did the ancestor of the mimic choose this particular model among scores of other noxious species in the same fauna? Darwin answers that the first step must rely upon a slight fortuitous resemblance to one particular model — thus setting an initial (and accidental) tiny advantage that natural selection can “notice” and thence­forth enhance.

In a famous passage, Darwin uses this argument to defend the evolution of complex lens-eyes by natural selection:

To suppose that the eye, with all its inimitable contrivances . . . could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest possible degree. Yet reason tells me, that if numerous grada­tions from a perfect and complex eye to one very imperfect and simple, each grade being useful to its possessor, can be shown to exist . . . then the difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection, though insuperable by our imagination, can hardly be considered real (1859, pp. 186-187).



Expanding his discussion in later editions, Darwin specifies a potential starting point of maximal simplicity in structure and function: “The simplest organ which can be called an eye consists of an optic nerve, surrounded by pigment-cells and covered by translucent skin, but without any lens or other refractive body. We may, however, ... descend even a step lower and find ag­gregates of pigment-cells, apparently serving as organs of vision, without any nerves, and resting merely on sarcodic tissue. Eyes of the above simple nature are not capable of distinct vision, and serve only to distinguish light from darkness” (1872b, p. 135).

Therefore, following this theme, if we wish to develop a complete evolu­tionary explanation for the role of Pax-6 homologies in regulating the forma­tion of complex structures in the lens-eyes of several phyla, we also need to understand its ancestral role in species with much simpler organs of vision, or without eyes at all. Why, in short, did Pax-6, rather than some other mole­cule, become the homologous “master control gene” of such complex struc­tures, especially if the common ancestor of modern phyla with lens-eyes had only evolved eyes of much simpler form and function?

Fortunately, even at our current embryonic stage of research, some intrigu­ing hints exist for a resolution, thus completing the intellectual structure of an evolutionary argument for important parallelism in the evolution of eyes, as regulated by the positive channel of Pax-6 homologies. Pax-6 homologs have been cloned from three cnidarian genera — from a jellyfish and a hydra (Sun et al., 1997, though questioned by Catmull et al., 1998). Catmull et al. specu­late (1998, p. 355) that “the capture of a homeobox by an ancestral Pax gene probably permitted a transition from functions in cell-fate specification to roles in anterior patterning,” and later to still more specialized roles in the development of the central nervous system and finally in the specification of eyes. Because Acropora lacks eyes, despite showing sensitivity to light, Catmull et al. suspect that the Pax-6 homolog of this cnidarian may regulate anterior (and distal) patterning of the nervous system. (They also conjecture, on the same grounds, that the Pax-6 homolog in the blind nematode C. elegans may operate as a plesiomorphic regulator of the head region, rather than as a sign of heritage from an eyed ancestor.)

But Sheng et al. (1997), in an intriguing discovery that might link Pax-6 to an ancestral function tied more closely to vision, found that Drosophila Pax-6 directly regulates the expression of the visual pigment rhodopsin in photoreceptor cells. Sheng et al. (1997, p. 1122) therefore propose that “the evolutionarily ancient role of Pax-6 was to regulate structural genes (e.g. rho­dopsin) in primitive photoreceptors, and only later did it expand its function to regulate the morphogenesis of divergent and complex eye structures.” “Pax-6,” they continue (p. 1129), “is locked in the regulatory pathway of eye development because of its more ancient function in the direct regulation of terminal photoreception genes like rh. Later in evolution, genes specific for each type of eye may have been added to this regulatory pathway to specify divergent and complex eye structures.”

This appealing hypothesis, if validated, would address both issues in Dar­win's dilemma, as described above, for the origin of organs of extreme com­plexity. First, Pax-6 would manifest a plesiomorphic function related to vi­sion in much simpler ancestral structures that can detect light or motion, but do not form images — for rhodopsin operates as a major visual pigment in such organs. Second, and proceeding phylogenetically further back to a po­tential utility even before the origin of vision (analogous to the initial choice of a model in the evolution of mimicry), rhodopsin operates in sensitivity towards light in all three multicellular kingdoms — suggesting a symplesiomorphy of great phyletic depth! — even when the physiological basis of response cannot be meaningfully compared with vision in animals. Rhodopsin, for example, acts in phototaxis to guide the swimming of green algae towards or away from light. Moreover, Saranak and Foster (1997) show that rhodop­sin also guides the zoospores of the fungus Allomyces reticulatus towards light — suggesting (Saranak and Foster, 1997, p. 465) “the origin of vi­sion might have been the phototaxis of their unicellular ancestors.”

PARALLELISM IN THE SMALL: THE ORIGIN OF CRUSTACEAN FEEDING ORGANS. Although interphylum parallelisms, based on homologies of developmental pathways, may provide greater eclat for their status as both utterly unanticipated in traditional Darwinian theory, and also a bit “weird” to boot, the greater importance and transformative power of this principle for the ordinary practice of evolutionary research will surely reside in the far more numerous and precisely defined cases of parallel evolution within much smaller monophyletic clades. In these instances, a parallel rather than conver­gent basis for similar adaptations does not provoke the same sort of surprise (for this alternative had always been plausible in theory for taxa of shared Bauplan and relatively recent common ancestry), but the value of parallelism becomes greatly increased by the operational basis thus granted to firm and testable explanations — by moving away from adaptationist scenarios in the largely speculative mode, and towards morphogenetic rules with specifiable, even predictable, realizations.

Ultimately, I suspect that the major reformatory significance in such accumulating examples of parallelism “in the small” will lie primarily in their capacity to resuscitate, and place upon center stage, the once derided formalist concept that taxonomic order largely represents the realized manifestations of more general developmental rules and pathways (“laws of form” in the ar­chaic, but not entirely invalid, terminology of Geoffroy's biology), rather than the adaptive nuclei where environmental advantage reins in a much more promiscuous range of possibilities. (In this formalist or structuralist view, adaptation by natural selection surely sets the actual points of occupation along potential pathways of realizable form, but basic taxonomic order reflects the limits and preferred channels of internal potential as much, or more, than the happenstances of immediate selective advantage.)

To cite just one impressive case of extensive parallelism in the taxonomic order of a substantial clade within a phylum, Averof and Patel (1997) have studied the action of the Hox genes Ubx and abdA in specifying the form of gnathal and thoracic appendages in Crustacea. In most arthropods, the gnathal appendages (maxillae) are specialized for feeding, and the larger tho­racic appendages for locomotion. But in numerous and phyletically varied crustacean taxa, appendages of the anterior thoracic segments have been re­duced in size and specialized for primary utility in feeding. These thoracic feeding limbs are called maxillipeds, and phyletic analysis clearly illustrates their multiple independent evolution within the Crustacea.

As a general, and presumably ancestral, pattern in Crustacea, the transition between gnathal and thoracic segments marks the anterior expression bound­ary for Ubx and abdA, and these genes do not operate in the gnathal region, where smaller feeding appendages (maxillae) develop. The branchiopods, for example, follow this basic scheme: Ubx and abdA are expressed throughout the thorax, and no maxillipeds form (Averof and Akam, 1995). These genes do not operate in the anterior gnathal segments, which develop the smaller maxillae. In other groups, the generation of maxillipeds on anterior thoracic segments correlates precisely with the suppression of Ubx and abdA in these segments alone, and these specialized appendages then grow to resemble the smaller maxillae of the adjacent anterior (gnathal) region of the AP axis, where Ubx and abdA are not expressed in normal development.

The precision of this correlation is impressive, and presumably causal. Among the malacostracans, for example, the leptostracans also develop no maxillipeds, and Ubx and abdA are expressed throughout the thorax. But in peracarids, the first, and sometimes the second, of eight thoracic appendages develop as maxillipeds. Averof and Patel (1997) document the suppression of both Ubx and abdA in these anterior thoracic segments with maxillipeds. In Mysidium colombiae, for example, Tl generates a maxilliped, whereas the appendage of T2 remains primarily a swimming organ, but develops gnathal features at its distal end. Averof and Patel found that Ubx and abdA are entirely repressed in Tl, but expressed in the proximal portion of the T2 endopod, while being excluded from the distal portion that acquires the gnathal features of a maxilliped.

The familiar decapods (lobsters, crabs, shrimp) generally bear eight tho­racic segments, the anterior three with maxillipeds and the posterior five with walking legs (hence the name of the group, meaning 10-footed). This situa­tion correlates perfectly with the suppression of Ubx and abdA in the first three thoracic segments by backward shifting of their joint anterior expres­sion boundary. The finer scale variations within the clade also follow the same developmental rule. For example, although adult lobsters of the most familiar (and edible) Homarus americanus bear the usual five pairs of large thoracic limbs and three pairs of anterior maxillipeds, only T1 and T2 show limb reduction at hatching, while the appendage of T3, at this early stage, continues to resemble a walking leg in size and form. Averof and Patel found that, at this intermediate point in development, Ubx and abdA are repressed only in T1 and T2. (The repression presumably extends to T3 during later molts, but Averof and Patel do not present data for these later stages.)

Maxillipeds also develop in several other crustacean groups, widely dis­persed within the taxonomic space of the clade. In a non-exhaustive compi­lation, Averof and Patel found no exceptions to the rule that maxillipeds develop instead of walking legs when the anterior expression boundary of Ubx and abdA shifts back, thus suppressing the action of these Hox genes in a specified number of anterior thoracic segments. For example, Averof and Patel (1997) studied two copepod species with maxillipeds only on Tl. They found (unsurprisingly by now) that the anterior expression boundary of Ubx and abdA had shifted back only one segment, with activity beginning inT2.

The important evolutionary message of these findings follows from the clear implication, based on cladistic analysis, that maxillipeds have arisen several times, and independently, in crustacean phylogeny — but always, as Averof and Patel's data illustrate so impressively, under control of the same homologous developmental rule, presumably a plesiomorphic trait of the clade. Thus, this striking example of clearly adaptive, multiply repeated, and effectively identical, transformations of anterior thoracic walking legs to feeding appendages represents a striking case of parallel evolution based on frequent evocation of a homologous developmental pathway, and not a dem­onstration of convergent evolution rooted in similar pressures of natural selection acting upon unconstrained and “random” variation in each case.

Averof and Patel (1997, p. 686) affirm this interpretation, but unfortu­nately introduce some terminological confusion (albeit minor, and easily cor­rectable) in summarizing their splendid study: “Our findings indicate that such convergent changes may have been achieved by similar developmental changes (involving similar posterior shifts in the expression boundary of Ubx-abdA) on several independent occasions. This suggests that, given a par­ticular developmental system, there may be limited ways for achieving a par­ticular morphological result.”

But these changes are fully parallel, and not convergent, in both develop­mental pathway and phenotypic result because maxillipeds arise by inde­pendent recruitment and expression of the same, homologically retained de­velopmental rule among the taxa that independently evolve appendages of the same basic form and anatomical structure along a strongly positive and clearly adaptive internal channel of constraint. (For lens eyes of squid and vertebrates, on the other hand, homologous generators build similar struc­tures from different tissues — thus making the eyes largely convergent as adult phenotypes and largely parallel in developmental architecture.)





PHARAONIC BRICKS AND CORINTHIAN COLUMNS. In both gastronomy and the academy, too much of a good thing can quickly pall. A concept, to be useful and interesting, must make distinctions and define categories of exclusion. A rubric for all possible cases explains nothing — as Gilbert and Sullivan's Grand Inquisitor Don Alhambra explained to the naively egalitar­ian Gondolier Kings of Barataria: “When everyone is somebody, then no one's anybody.”

It is certainly understandable, and probably psychologically inevitable, that exciting discoveries tend to become overextended in the first flush of re­formatory application. Our recently acquired ability to identify genetic homologies in the developmental pathways of homoplastic final structures has sometimes engendered a misplaced enthusiasm for reinterpreting similarities previously ascribed to pure convergence as examples of parallel evolution (defined as homoplastic results based on homology of underlying generators).

But, as I have argued throughout this book, concepts only become interest­ing in contexts set by the logic and the history of theoretical issues thus ad­dressed. The primary significance in recasting convergence as parallelism lies in the very different implications of the two processes both within Darwinian theory and for the larger question of the relative weights that should be as­signed to internal structural constraint and functional adaptation in populat­ing the morphospace of life's history. Pure convergence stands at a Darwinian functional extreme, where uncanny similarities of phyletically distant taxa arise from entirely different starting points, propelled by selective pressures alone, without any boost from internal channeling.

Parallelism, by contrast and with reversed evolutionary meaning, attributes the identical result, at least in large part, to a homologous generating channel that guides two inde­pendent sequences of selection down the same path from within.

Parallelism will only define an interesting antithesis to convergence if the underlying homology prescribes a highly distinctive, detailed, and strongly determinative channel of constraint — for only then will the homoplastic re­sult owe its primary form to the structure of the internal channel, and not to the functional processes of adaptation acting from outside. But if, on the other hand, the underlying homology only generates a simple immediate product, leading to a broad and non-specific range of potential outcomes, the homology establishes no meaningful channel of internal constraint, and makes no contribution to the revisionary power of this theme within evolu­tionary theory — that is, to move away from an endpoint of pure Darwinian functionalism towards a more comprehensive theory, enriched by contrasting perspectives based on structural principles of internal channeling.

In the light of our burgeoning knowledge of genetic sequences and their ac­tions, homology of some sort or level will always be found in underlying gen­erators of similar end products — if only (however much the example becomes a reductio ad absurdum) because all organisms share the same genetic code by common ancestry. But no one would argue that we should redescribe a classical case of convergence as parallelism simply because the markedly dif­ferent developmental pathways of the two adaptations both rest upon the ac­tion of genes made of DNA!

The analogy in the title of this subsection may help to clarify the central issue of this important discussion. We need to develop criteria for ordering and evaluating our highly varied and ever-growing compendium of homoplastic results generated along homologous developmental pathways — for these cases fall along a continuum from narrow and controlling channels of constraint to insignificant sharing of nonspecific building blocks. When Pha­raoh “made the children of Israel serve with rigor” (Exodus 1:13), they fabri­cated bricks to use in a full range of buildings: “And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses” (Exodus 1:11). Now if these bricks built every structure in the city, from great pyramids to public toilets, we might identify a homologous generator of all final products (bricks of the same composition made by the same people in the same way over a continu­ous stretch of time). But we could scarcely argue that these homologous gen­erators exerted any important constraint over the differing forms of Pha­raoh's final products — if only because all realized architectural diversity shared the same building blocks.

But if I note a majestic portico of Corinthian columns in front of a building in modern Manhattan, I recognize a strong internal constraint imposed by an architectural module of very different status. The Corinthian column, last and most ornate of the classical orders, consists of a slender fluted shaft (with 24 flutes in “standard” examples), capped by a striking, distinctive, and elaborate capital (the defining “species” character in a taxonomic analogy) adorned with stylized acanthus leaves. Few Greek examples survive, but the Romans then used Corinthian columns extensively and for several centuries. Vetruvius, who wrote the only surviving work on classical architecture, de­scribed such columns in detail in the 1st century bc, and later builders of the Italian Renaissance replicated the design in all aspects of form and propor­tion, whence, ever since, buildings in classical style have often used Corinthian columns on their facades, porticos and lobbies.

Like Pharaonic bricks, Corinthian columns hold clear status as homolo­gous underlying generators for their continuous phyletic history and stable form. But whereas Pharaonic bricks did little to constrain a resulting building by their form or structural character, and would not therefore sustain an in­teresting interpretation of parallelism for two similar buildings that happened to employ them in construction (if only because many other, very unsimilar, buildings in town also use the same bricks), Corinthian columns do exert a strong structural constraint from an inherited past (a homology) that can help us to identify and distinguish buildings, even 2500 years after the inven­tion of this unchanged form.

First of all, we can identify the lineage of the element just by looking (for the acanthus leaves mark the species), so I know the source of constraint before proceeding any further, whereas a brick may be difficult to peg as Pharaonic, or as a product of independent invention for a simple, obvious and utilitarian form (a Chinese version, for example). Second, tradition and intrinsic form dictate that this large and elaborate column only be used in limited ways (whereas my Pharaonic brick can build almost anything) — so the choice of the column constrains the form and function of the building. For example, in commercial areas of Manhattan, we can be pretty sure that a set of Corinthian columns will be fronting a bank, a government building or a church — so the generator constrains the function. In residential areas, we can be confident that a similar set of columns will mark the domicile of wealthy folks, not the entrance to a public housing project — so the generator also con­strains the location and social setting.

In short, and emphasizing the evolutionary analogy, two similar build­ings made of identical bricks in the cities of Pithom or Raamses are not constrained to be alike by the structural properties of their admittedly ho­mologous building blocks. The bricks represent a lowest level, non-specific, non-constraining homologous generator, and the similarity between the two buildings is convergent, a result of architectural decisions about good form for an intended purpose — that is, a product of external selection based on re­quired function, not of internal channeling imposed by component parts. But the similar form of a town hall in modern America and a market hall in an­cient Rome, as highlighted by their nearly identical facades of Corinthian col­umns, must be attributed, in large part, to the complex, highly specific, phyletically stable design of these chosen architectural modules, which therefore do constrain the form and function of the buildings in important ways. We may therefore ascribe much of the similarity to parallelism, based on the com­mon choice of a homologous building element that establishes a channel of expectation, and has done so for millennia (and also includes too much com­plexity and too little flexibility to be used in many ways beyond the tradi­tional employment).*

Thus, examples of homologous underlying generators form a continuum from Pharaonic bricks, which are too simple, general, and multipurpose to constrain a final result in important ways, to Corinthian columns, which are sufficiently complex, structurally limited in potential utility, and restricted by a long and stable history of traditional employment, to channel any building into just a few recognized forms and functions. When underlying homolo­gous generators operate like Corinthian columns, they entail interpretations of parallelism, rather than pure convergence, for structural and functional similarities in resulting adult anatomies. But when homologous generators operate like Pharaonic bricks, they usually do not strongly constrain similari­ties between two independent structures built with their aid, and we would not automatically, on this basis, ascribe such similarities to parallel evolution. I do not know how to ordain hard and fast rules for breaking this smooth continuum into sharp domains of bricks that permit interpretations of con­vergence vs. columns that imply parallelism — but I trust that the analogy will clarify the issues involved, which must then be adjudicated on a case-by-case basis.

Heretofore, as the argument of this chapter demanded, I have been present­ing cases of biological equivalents to Corinthian columns, leading to reassignments of convergence to parallelism (although I did raise the “brick” issue in wondering whether the signaling system behind dorsoventral inversion of ar­thropods and vertebrates might be too broad to bear Geoffroy's interpreta­tion — because such a general system may regulate many other distinctions as well, and may therefore become prone to independent cooptation (in differ­ent form) by two separate groups. Therefore, the facts of DV inversion do not yet guarantee an explanation as two different specializations of a homolo­gous and archetypal ancestral state — see p. 1122).

But many examples of homologous generators acting more like bricks than columns have also been accumulating in the literature. Such examples imply interpretations more favorable to adaptation (and convergence) than to con­straint (and parallelism) for two distinct reasons: first, because bricks are too general and non-specific in their operation to exert much constraint upon the complex form of a final product; and, second, because bricks are sufficiently simple and multifarious in their range of potential developmental utility that each of two lineages now using the same brick in the same way, may have co-opted this architectural module independently, and from a different ancestral use in each case. In this second circumstance, the functional similarity of bricks in the two lineages would not even be homologous, given their inde­pendent cooptation from different sources, although the bricks remain ho­mologous in genetic structure (by attribution of the requisite similarity in nucleotide sequences to a more distant common ancestor).

To cite just two examples of bricks (that is, very general and effectively nonconstraining homologies of genetic and developmental architecture) from the recently published genome of the nematode, C. elegans: First, for homologies going “down” life's traditional ladder, Chalfie (1998, p. 620) noted the brick-like nature of worm genes with homologs in yeast: “Most orthologues [to yeast] in the worm are needed for . . . core functions, such as intermediary metabolism, DNA-, RNA- and protein-metabolism, transport and secretion, and cytoskeletal structure. In contrast, yeast has no ortho­logues for many of the proteins involved in intercellular signaling and gene regulation in C. elegans.” Second, for brick-like homologies going “up” the same fallacious ladder, Bohm et al. (1997) found that the par-1 gene of C. elegans, which codes for a protein that activates the markedly asymmetrical division of cells in the first embryonic cleavage, has a mammalian homolog that regulates the polarization of epithelial cells.

This central issue of Pharaonic bricks and Corinthian columns has become most salient in the fascinating and rapidly developing literature on the extent and meaning of similarities in development between the appendages of arthropods and vertebrates (Tickle, 1992; Tabin, Carroll and Panganiban, 1999; Panganiban et al., 1997; Shubin, Tabin and Carroll, 1997; Arthur, Jewett and Panchen, 1999; Minelli, 2000; for example). I will state my own tentative reading of these preliminary data up front: most documented homologies are too brick-like to impart a sufficiently strong and specific con­straint for validating either the actual homology of limbs themselves, or even a claim for predominant parallelism in the evolution of homoplastic append­ages. This situation may be contrasted with the highly and specifically chan­neled developmental homologies underlying the establishment and differenti­ation of major body axes, several aspects of segmentation itself, and the evolution of important homoplastic organs at several levels, including eyes among phyla and maxillipeds among crustacean taxa. These homologies are more than sufficiently column-like to validate channels of internal constraint as primary determinants of specific final products. However, some attributes of homoplastic features in arthropod and vertebrate appendages do offer in­triguing hints that, even here, developmental homologies may be sufficiently column-like in some cases to implicate constraints of internal generating channels as major causes of similarity in adult structures.

As a prime example of a brick-like developmental homology, now regarded as too broad and loosely constraining to specify important details of final products as outcomes shaped by internal channels, but often regarded as more column-like in the first excitement of discovery, the Drosophila distal-less gene (Dll) is expressed at the distal tip of developing appendages and seems important in regulating their outgrowth from the body axis (Cohen et al., 1989). In the mid 1990's, researchers found a mammalian homolog (called Dlx) that seems to operate in virtually the same way, with expression along the distal edge of the chick wing bud (Carroll et al., 1994; Panganiban et al., 1995).

But as studies proceeded, an embarras de richesses soon became appar­ent, as distal-less homologs were found at the terminal regions of almost any structure that grows out from a central mass or body axis in all three great groups of bilaterians — including annelid parapodia, onychophoran lobopodia, tunicate ampullae and echinoderm tube feet (Panganiban et al., 1997). Lee and Jacobs (1999) then pointed out that not only does distal-less seem to regulate the proximodistal axis of any outgrowth, but it also tends to show preferred action in early embryos (including maternal transcripts in several cases), in animal poles and anterior regions of developing embryos, and in ectodermal germ layers. Thus, distal-less may not only display the broad function of regulating outgrowths at their distal tips; it may also oper­ate in the service of even more basic distinctions that can only be designated as early, anterior and top. Distal-less, in this sense, must be regarded as a quintessential Pharaonic brick of protean character, or just about as non-specifically unconstraining as an internal developmental element can be. If anyone wanted to argue that insect and vertebrate appendages should be deemed homologous because both are regulated by distal-less homologs, then these structures are only homologous as outgrowths in all Bilateria, and the claim becomes almost as meaninglessly broad as saying that I am homolo­gous to each of my E. coli residents because we are both made of DNA inher­ited from a common ancestor. Moreover, with such a broad range of func­tions, and such ubiquity of occurrence, distal-less genes might have been independently coopted from different copies with different utilities, rather than commonly employed from the same ancestral source, in the arthropod and vertebrate forebears that first used them to regulate the outgrowth of ap­pendages.

Panganiban et al. (1997, p. 5165) state the case for such a broad and rela­tively unconstraining homology: “The most straightforward explanation for these observations is that the last common ancestor of the protostomes and deuterostomes had some primitive type of body wall outgrowths, e.g., a sen­sory or perhaps a simple locomotory appendage, and that the genetic cir­cuitry governing the outgrowth of this structure was deployed at new sites many times during evolution.” Shubin et al. (1997, p. 647) then add a reason­able, but admittedly indecisive, argument for favoring common ancestry over independent cooptation: “The expression of Dll-related genes could repre­sent convergent utilization of the gene. However, the fact that out of the hun­dreds of transcription factors that potentially could have been used, Dll is ex­pressed in the distal portions of appendages in six coelomate phyla makes it more likely that Dll was already involved in regulating body wall outgrowths in a common ancestor of these taxa.”

On the other hand, when homologies of underlying generators (for homo-plastic structures between phyla) begin to involve several genes and their complex interactions — rather than just one product expressed at the distal tip of any outgrowth — then the homology attains sufficient definition and spe­cificity to act as a constraining Corinthian column of positive evolution­ary channeling, rather than as an all-purpose Pharaonic brick for building nearly any kind of structure that natural selection might favor. For exam­ple, no one would argue that the chick forearm and fly wing are homologous as flight appendages, if only for the obvious and compelling reason that basal chordates — not only as inferred from living surrogates, but also as rea­sonably well represented in the fossil record of the Cambrian explosion and its sequelae — lack paired appendages entirely. But accumulating evidence now indicates that all three major axes (anteroposterior, dorsoventral, and proximodistal) may be established (or at least strongly regulated) by homo­logous, and respectably complex, genes and their interactions — a strong case for meaningful column-like constraint in this important anatomical system as well.

In the wing or leg imaginal disc of Drosophila, hedgehog acts to establish the AP axis by initial expression in the posterior compartment of the disc. In response to Hedgehog, a thin layer of cells along the border of both anterior and posterior compartments produces another protein encoded by the dpp gene, “dpp, in turn, is a long-range signal providing positional information, and hence differential AP fates, to cells in both compartments” (Shubin et al., 1997, p. 645). The vertebrate limb develops in a similar way under homolo­gous influences. Sonic Hedgehog (Shh), a homolog of Drosophila hedgehog, is also located in the posterior part of the limb bud, and also induces a homolog of dpp, called Bmp-2 in its vertebrate version, which then acts in differentiating the AP axis. Interestingly, and in a striking confirmation of im­portant homology in function as well as structure, misexpression of either Shh or hedgehog on the anterior rather than the posterior edge of the devel­oping appendage causes the same striking malformation: mirror image dupli­cations at the anterior border.

In organizing the proximodistal structure of the Drosophila wing, a spe­cialized set of cells, called the wing margin, runs along the DV border of the imaginal wing disc. The fringe gene establishes the edge of the developing wing at the interface between cells that do and do not express fringe. The ver­tebrate apical ectodermal ridge (AER), like the Drosophila wing margin, also runs along the DV border of the developing limb bud. Radical fringe, a verte­brate homolog of fringe, is also expressed in the dorsal region limb ectoderm before the AER forms. Moreover, at the border of cells that do and do not ex­press radical fringe, Ser-2, a homologue of Drosophila serrate (an important element in the downstream cascade regulated by fringe) becomes expressed, and the AER then forms.

Data for the DV axis are less well developed, but “genes specifying DV po­larity in both groups have been identified” (Shubin et al., 1997, p. 646). For example, in Drosophila, the expression of apterous helps to define the dorsal compartment of the wing disc and also specifies dorsal cell fates. A related, but not clearly homologous vertebrate gene, Lmx-1, defines a dorsal com­partment of the vertebrate limb, and also conveys dorsal cell fate.

Shubin et al. (1997, p. 646) summarize the evolutionary meaning of these complex, column-like developmental constraints: “The simplest phylogenetic implication to draw from these comparisons is that individual genes that are expressed in the three orthogonal axes are more ancient than either insect or vertebrate limbs ... either similar genetic circuits were convergently recruited to make the limbs of different taxa or a set of these signaling and regulatory systems are ancient and patterned a structure in the common ancestor of protostomes and deuterostomes.”

Their stated preference for the second alternative (Shubin et al., 1997, p. 647) illustrates the intermediary character of this example, as recording too broad a constraint to permit the identification of any particular verte­brate limb as “the same” structure as any given arthropod appendage, but also as based upon a sufficiently detailed and complex set of genetic homologies to set a common developmental channel with more specificity than a Pharaonic brick, albeit not at the level of constraint of a full Corinthian col­umn: “This ancestral structure need not have been homologous to arthropod or vertebrate limbs; the regulatory system could have originally patterned any one of a number of outgrowths of the body wall in a primitive bilaterian for example . . . The key step in animal limb evolution was the establishment of an integrated genetic system to promote and pattern the development of certain outgrowths. Once established, this system provided the genetic and de­velopmental foundation for the evolution of structures as diverse as wings, fins, antennae and lobopodia.”





Movement three, Scherzo: Does evolutionary change often proceed

by saltation down channels of historical constraint?


As I documented in Chapters 4 and 5, internally channeled evolution (ortho­genesis) has been intimately linked with discontinuous change (saltationism) in the history of structuralist thought (with the model of “Galton's polyhe­dron” serving as the classical image for the connection). The linkage isn't physically necessary or logically impelled, for some orthogeneticists have fa­vored gradualism (C. O. Whitman, pp. 383-395), whereas some saltationists have rejected internal directionality (Hugo de Vries, pp. 415-451). But in ex­panding the causes of evolutionary change beyond the incremental gradual­ism of externally directed Darwinian selection, and in regarding internal channels of developmental constraint as important mediators of phyletic trending, most advocates of formalist or structuralist explanation (Bateson, D'Arcy Thompson, and Goldschmidt, for example) have supported some linkage of channeled directionality with at least the possibility of saltational movement down the channels — if only because the potential phyletic analog of such ontogenetic phenomena as metamorphosis seems intriguing and worth exploration.

Thus, with the reintroduction of internal channeling by historical con­straint (based on genetic homology) into our explanatory schemes, we must ask whether saltational themes (that had been even more firmly rejected by the Darwinian Synthesis) can also advance a strong case for a rehearing. My own conclusions are primarily negative (hence my parsing of this theme as a scherzo, and as the shortest movement of my analysis), but the subject clearly merits some airing (and undoubtedly holds limited validity), if only as a sign of respect for the intuition of so many fine evolutionists, throughout the his­tory of our subject, that structural channeling — now clearly affirmed as a theme of central importance — implies a serious consideration of saltational mechanics.

As discussed extensively in Chapter 9, in the context of debate over punc­tuated equilibrium, notions of “rapidity” depend strongly upon the time scales of their context. Invocations of suddenness raise quite different evolu­tionary issues at each level of consideration. In this section, I shall discuss true saltation (discontinuous changes, potentially across a single generation, and usually mediated by small genetic alterations with major developmental ef­fects), and not punctuational patterns at larger scales of time (continuous changes that would be regarded as slow and gradual across human lifetimes, but that appear instantaneous when scaled against the millions of years in stasis for a resulting species or developmental Bauplan).

Nonetheless, I note in passing the relevance of developmental themes to punctuational patterns at these larger, and very different, scales of explana­tion. For example, several authors have argued that our emerging concepts of deep homology might help to elucidate such macroevolutionary “classics” of large-scale rapidity as the Cambrian explosion. Under Lewis's (1978) original model of evolution from ancestral homonomy (multiple, identical segments) by accretion of duplicated Hox genes to achieve differentiation of specialized parts along the body axis, the Bauplan of the major animal phyla must origi­nate separately and gradually, as each added developmental component per­mits further differentiation. How, then, could so many basic designs make such a coordinated first appearance in five to ten million years, unless some genetic glitch or unknown environmental trigger initiated a rampant episode of duplication in many lineages simultaneously, or unless the pattern only represents an artifact of preservation, rather than an actual macroevolutionary event?

But the first fruits of evo-devo (see next movement, pp. 1147–1178 for full discussion) have reversed this scenario by documenting a full complement of Hox genes in the most homonomously segmented invertebrate bilaterian phyla, thus suggesting the opposite process of loss and divergence for the differentiation of numerous complex and specialized patterns from initial homonomy (De Rosa et al., 1999). The punctuational character of the Cambrian explosion seems far easier to understand if the basic regulatory structure already existed in ancestral homonomous taxa, and the subsequent diversification of Bauplan therefore marks the specialization and regionalization of potentials already present, rather than a dedicated and individual­ized addition for each major novelty of each new Bauplan. The Cambrian ex­plosion still requires a trigger (see Knoll and Carroll, 1999, for a discussion of possible environmental mediators, including the classical idea of an achieved threshold in atmospheric oxygen), but our understanding of the geological rapidity of this most puzzling and portentous event in the evolution of ani­mals will certainly be facilitated if the developmental prerequisites already ex­isted in an ancestral taxon.

Knoll and Carroll (1999, p. 2134) stress this point in a section of their arti­cle entitled “Cambrian diversification: So many arthropods, so little time.” They add (loc. cit., see also Grenier et al., 1997, p. 551):

The entire onychophoran-arthropod clade possesses essentially the same set of Hox genes that pattern the main body axis. Thus, Cambrian and recent diversity evolved around an ancient and conserved set of Hox genes . . . Increase in segment diversity is correlated with changes in the relative domains of Hox gene expression along the main body axis . . . Most body plan evolution arose in the context of very similar sets of Hox genes, and thus was not driven by Hox gene duplication . . . Bilaterian body plan diversification has occurred primarily through changes in developmental regulatory networks rather than the genes themselves, which evolved much earlier.



But returning to the very different, central subject of this section — the pos­sibility and meaning of evolutionary saltation at the organismic level of dis­continuity across generations — we may at least assert a case for plausibility, so that, at the very least, this perennially contentious subject will not be dis­missed a priori. First of all, we cannot deny either the existence of such large and discontinuous phenotypic shifts in mutant organisms, or the conven­tional basis assigned to them: small genetic alterations with major develop­mental consequences. For example, a single base substitution in bicoid, the maternal gene product that sets the AP axis by supplying positional informa­tion within the Drosophila larva, can reverse the axes of symmetry (Frohnhofer and Nusslein-Volhard, 1986; Struhl et al, 1989). Of this and other cases, Akam et al., in the introduction to their 1994 book on The Evolution of Developmental Mechanics write (1994, p. ii): “It is a commonplace of de­velopmental genetics that minimal genetic change can lead to the most dra­matic morphological effect.”

Second, we can also posit believable mechanisms that avoid the classical problems of specifying how genes with such disruptive effects could ever be integrated into the intricate and finely tuned development of a complex metazoan ontogeny and, even if viable, how such saltations could spread through populations following their mutational origin in single individuals, given the almost inevitable fitness depression that must accompany any inter­breeding with modal individuals. Schwartz (1999), for example, presents a modern version of the old argument for origin in a nonlethal recessive state, followed by accumulation without expression in heterozygotes until the achievement of a critical frequency permits an effectively simultaneous overt appearance of the phenotype in numerous homozygotes. Addressing the second aspect of this problem, and basing their case on a viable homeotic mutant in a homonomous species of centipedes, Kettle et al. (1999, p. 393) argue that most workable mutations of such large effect may arise in homonomous ancestors of more specialized groups: “Perhaps the severe fitness depression accompanying homeotic transformation would have been less pronounced, even absent, in a primitive arthropod with many similar seg­ments.”

But mere plausibility doesn't imply likelihood, and two strong arguments would seem to indicate a minimal role for the evolutionary efficacy of such developmental saltations: first, a negative statement based on the fallacy of usual sources of inference; and, second, a positive argument about more plau­sible alternatives for the same sources of inference.

For the negative statement, both common arguments for inferring saltational origins from modern developmental patterns falter upon the general fallacy (discussed in detail in Chapter 11) of invoking current circumstances to make unwarranted inferences about historical origins:

1. The fact that major phenotypic effects accompany the repression or al­teration of key developmental switches in modern organisms does not imply a saltational origin either for the switch itself, or for any extensive conse­quences of its mutational variations. For example, the fact that Hox genes now repress the expression of Dll in the insect abdomen, thus suppressing the development of appendages — and that a single mutation (albeit ultimately le­thal) in one Hox gene can reverse this effect and emplace leg rudiments on each larval segment (Lewis, 1978) — does not permit the inference that insects lost their abdominal legs in one phylogenetic saltation.

2. Reasonable inferences about saltational losses cannot be theoretically inverted into hypotheses about sudden origins for the developmental cascades thus repressed. (We note here a developmental version of the error so com­monly committed as a thoughtless consequence of naming the normal func­tion of genes for the results of their discombobulation. If the mutational si­lencing of a gene precludes the development of a child's ability to read, we have not thereby identified a “reading gene,” although such taxonomies and inferences remain all too frequent in our literature, particularly on human cognitive abilities.) For example, the fact (Swalla and Jeffery, 1996) that a loss-of-function mutation in the Manx gene of the tunicate Mogula can re­press chordate features and lead to a tailless (anural) larva — and that this function can be restored in interspecific hybrids with other Mogula species that develop with a tailed (urodele) larval form — does not imply that the tuni­cate larval tail and notocord (once a popular theme in theories about the origin of vertebrates, as in the classic paper of Garstang, 1928) arose by saltational introduction of Manx activity. (Swalla and Jeffery make no such inference, of course, and I hate to see their fascinating discovery so misused, as in many press reports.)

As a general structural principle, applicable across a full range of natural phenomena, from cosmology to human social organization, complex systems can usually collapse catastrophically, whereas the construction of such func­tional intricacy can only occur by sequential accumulation — a pattern that I have called “the great asymmetry” (Gould, 1998a).

For the positive argument, more plausible continuationist scenarios can ex­plain the modern phenomena that most often tempt us to invoke hypothetical saltation to resolve their origin. In an important article, for example, Akam (1998) discusses the property of Hox action that has often led to saltational inferences: “The Hox genes might justifiably be considered master control genes (Gehring, 1996) for segment identity. For most segments of the insect trunk, they provide the only conduit for channeling axial information from the early embryo to cells at the later stages of development.” Akam then ex­poses the same fallacy that I discussed above as negative point 2: “It is tempt­ing to shift this process into reverse, and to assume that segment diversifica­tion has been achieved by a series of overt homeotic mutations generating novel complexity.”

Akam then develops a much more plausible evolutionary model for the incremental origin of developmental patterns mediated by so-called “selector genes,” which have generally been viewed “as stable binary switches that di­rect lineages of cells to adopt alternative developmental fates” (Akam, 1998, p. 445). Akam proposes an alternative concept “for the regulation of Hox genes within compartments” by “enhancer modules,” conceptualized as “lo­cal signals, hormone receptors or any of the other stimuli that commonly me­diate gene regulation. In this regard, it makes the Hox genes like any other genes. It predicts that small changes, particularly in the structure of their promotor modules, will change the phenotype of segments” (p. 448). “By ac­cepting a role for the regulation of Hox genes within compartments,” Akam adds (p. 448), “we demote them from their privileged status as stable binary switches.”

Akam envisages the gradual evolution of different enhancers (or different levels and mixtures of the same enhancers) in various arthropod segments, leading to a phyletically diverging regulation of the same Hox gene down the body axis, but with continued expression in a segment-specific manner. Ubx for example is regulated by the 'abx' enhancers in parasegment 5, which inte­grate patterning information in one way, but by the 'bxd' enhancers in para­segment 6, which specify a different within-segment pattern.” As these alter­ations in expression evolved gradually within different segments, “the change would not necessarily be recognized as a 'homeotic mutation'” (p. 448). These and other models reinforce the important principle that extensive and discontinuous phenotypic effects in the development of modern organisms do not imply the saltational origin of these features in phylogeny.

Other models, however, permit more space for an important frequency of saltational shifts in evolution. Duboule and Wilkins (1998), for example, tie an increasing propensity for saltational change to functional recruitment of genes for multiple tasks: “Transitions from gradual to discontinuous rates of evolutionary change are an inevitable consequence of the multiple use of genes through evolutionary tinkering, given appropriate selective pressures” (1998, p. 54). Interestingly, in the context of this chapter and the history of this subject, their model explicitly links this increasing frequency of salta­tion to the “hardening” of internal constraints that arise as a consequence of incorporating key genes into multiple networks of regulation. They write (p. 58): “The greater the number of networks that a gene product is involved in, the smaller the scope for new variations to be offered to natural selection. The idea of internal constraints leading to restrictions in the production of evolutionary novelties is not new. However, we would like to argue that inter­nal constraints result, indirectly but inevitably, from the increasing work load imposed by successive recruitment of genes to new functions.” In networks of such complexity, they conclude, any “novel equilibrium will have to be estab­lished as a one-step event and not through the accumulation, in time and space, of many mutations of small effect, or gradualistic change” (p. 58).

In any case, and however important such saltational changes may be in establishing fundamental evolutionary novelties (my own betting money goes on a minor and infrequent role), phyletic discontinuity at lower taxonomic levels, based on small genetic changes with large regulatory effects, has been documented in several cases. In a fascinating example, Ford and Gottlieb (1992) found that about 20-30 percent of several hundred Clarkia concinna plants growing in a single locality at Point Reyes, California displayed the bicalyx mutant, a homeotic variation that replaces the usual circlet of four bright pink petals with a second circlet of sepals.

By Mendelian analysis of ratios in cross breeding between normal and bicalyx plants, Ford and Gottlieb established that a single point mutation produces the bicalyx phenotype. Moreover, and in contrast to many home­otic mutations, the bicalyx plants show no developmental abnormalities and no apparent fitness depressions; insect pollinators continue to visit bicalyx flowers with no apparent reduction in frequency. Ford and Gottlieb note (1992, p. 673) that “homeotic mutants have been found and propagated in gardens, but have almost never been reported as natural populations” — thus giving special interest to this case of viability in nature. (They also men­tion the intriguing historical footnote that Linnaeus himself found a peloric Linaria (with normal upper petals replaced by spurred lower petals), appar­ently growing in abundance within its habitat, but probably seed sterile, and therefore arising as a vegetatively propagated clone.)

Ford and Gottlieb outline a reasonable scenario for the promotion of this fecund, and naturally growing, homeotic form to specific status (1992, p. 673):

The absence of deleterious pleiotropy or fitness-reducing epistatic inter­actions in bicalyx suggests that mutations with extensive morphological consequences can be successfully accommodated by plant developmental systems. If such mutants were to become associated with chromosomal rearrangements reducing the fertility of hybrids between them and their progenitors, a process that has occurred repeatedly in Clarkia, the new population would probably be accorded species status (p. 673). Bicalyx demonstrates that a large morphological difference governed by a simple genetic change can become established in a natural plant population (p. 671).



Since bicalyx presumably establishes its large and homeotic effect through the developmental channel of the ABC system or some homolog (see previ­ous discussion on pp. 1063–1065), this case also illustrates the common link­age between internal channels as positive constraints and potential speed of phyletic movement down the channel — as Galton first proposed in his model of the polyhedron (see pp. 342–351). In a zoological example of the same linkage, Fitch (1997, p. 166) documents a “topological constraint” limiting the number and positions, and channeling the potential directions of evolu­tionary change, for rays in the male tail of the nematode C. elegans. Not only are the directions of potential change both limited and most plausibly at­tained by saltation, but the transitions can also be generated by single point mutations. Of this interesting correlation between constraint and saltation, Fitch concludes (1997, pp. 166-167): “Because single genetic changes can be postulated for some of the evolutionary change in the male tail, I predict that many evolutionary changes in morphology will have resulted mainly from changes at single loci . . . Because the power of selection is limited by varia­tion, such developmental constraints could cause significant bias in the evolu­tion of form.”

BILATERIAN HISTORY AS TOP-DOWN BY TINKERING OF AN INITIAL SET OF RULES, NOT BOTTOM-UP BY ADDING INCREMENTS OF COMPLEX­ITY. As a common pattern in the history of science, great and unexpected theoretical discoveries often elicit fairly conservative theoretical interpretations at first — if only because most of us can only imagine so much novelty at once. As discussed before in different contexts, when Ed Lewis (1978) recog­nized the Hox genes as linearly ordered in both space and time, and inferred their origin by tandem duplication from a precursor, he interpreted the evolu­tionary significance of these amplifications in an “obvious” and conventional manner (the proper “first pass” procedure in science, and therefore recalled here without critical intent, while noting that our later explanatory reversal only underscores the importance of Lewis's discovery). Lewis proposed that the addition of duplicated Hox genes could be directly and causally corre­lated with the specialization and differentiation of appendages along the ar­thropod AP axis, as an originally homonomous ancestor evolved into the di­verse Bauplan of major arthropod taxa. In particular, Lewis argued that an addition of Hox genes allowed evolving members of the insect line to suppress the growth of legs on the abdominal segments, and (in Diptera) to con­vert the wings of the second thoracic segment to halteres. Lewis's original sce­nario matches our conventional view of evolution, and of complex systems in general — particularly in the assumption that a history of increasing elabora­tion in overt products (the phenotypes of complex bilaterian phyla) should be underlain by a growth in the number and intricacy of generating factors (genes regulating developmental outcomes).

In one of the most important early discoveries of evo-devo, this entirely reasonable scenario has been overturned and, in large measure, reversed. Two strong sources of evidence now indicate that a full complement of Hox genes had already evolved in the presumably homonomous common ancestor, not only of the protostome phyla, but of the entire bilaterian line (thus further ex­emplifying the homologies of arthropods and vertebrates). The multiple and independent evolution from homonomy towards complexly specialized and differentiated Bauplan in several phyla did not entail any increase in the number of Hox genes, but rather a regionalization and decrease in the range of action of individual genes and, especially, changes in both the regulation and content of the downstream cascades differently engaged by the various Hox genes.

1. Modern homonomous organisms share the full complement of Hox genes with closest relatives among classically differentiated invertebrates. The genome of myriapods, the homonomous sister group of insects for exam­ple, includes a full set of insect Hox homologs (Raff, 1996). At the higher level of a sister group to the entire arthropod phylum, the undoubted “stan­dard” for highly differentiated body plans along the AP axis, the genome of the homonomous Onychophora also includes all insect Hox genes, as well as an ortholog of the pair-rule gene fushi tarazu (Grenier et al., 1997). (Mod­ern onychophores include only a few Gondwana species, restricted to moist terrestrial habitats. The generic name of the most famous modern form, Peripatus, honors the homonomy of the numerous lobopods, the pair of leglike structures on each segment. But the Onychophora included a promi­nent and diverse group of marine representatives in the earliest faunas of the Cambrian period.) Grenier et al. (1997, p. 549) conclude that “the segmental diversity of arthropods evolved without an increase in Hox gene number. The evolution of arthropod segmental diversity must therefore have involved reg­ulatory changes in Hox genes and/or their targets.”

2. Phylogenetic reconstruction affirms a full Hox complement for the bilaterian common ancestor, with restriction and occasional unemployment far more prominent than addition in subsequent evolution. The analysis of De Rosa et al. (1999) indicates at least 8 Hox genes for the protostome com­mon ancestor, and at least 7 for the bilaterian progenitor (see Fig. 10-24). Moreover, comparisons at greater detail support the growing consensus (see Halanych et al., 1995; and Aguinaldo et al., 1997, based on 18S ribosomal RNA) that the protostome phyla split into two great genealogical groups, the ecdysozoans or molting phyla (including arthropods, nematodes and priapulids), and the lophotrochozoans (including annelids, mollusks, brachiopods, platyhelminths, and nemerteans). The ecdysozoan genome includes the posterior Hox gene Abd-B, whereas lophotochozoans have two “Abd-B-like”





10-24. By this analysis and cladogram, the protostome common ancestor must have possessed at least eight Hox genes, whereas the bilaterian progenitor must have had seven. From De Rosa et al., 1999.





genes named Post1 and Post2. In addition, ecdysozoan genomes include Ubx in the central cluster, whereas lophotrochozonas share the different, but closely related, Lox2.

Although De Rosa et al. (1999) cite 7 as a minimum for the common bilaterian ancestor (lab/Hox1, pb/Hox2, Hox3, Dfd/Hox4, Scr/Hox5, one additional central gene and one posterior gene), Figure 10-24 also indicates at least 10 shared Hox genes for the stem lophotrochozoan and 8 for the stem ecdysozoan. Using a more generous estimate based on a hypothesis that “most or all of the Hox genes that are present in extant bilaterians may have been present in the common ancestor, but that some orthology relationships have become obscured” (De Rosa et al., 1999, p. 775), the protostome com­mon ancestor might have possessed ten Hox genes (the 7 listed above plus 2 central and 1 posterior), or even more if the deuterostome situation of multi­ple posterior Hox genes is primitive rather than derived. In any case, either a minimum of 7 or a maximum of 10 or more provides ample support for the key conclusion that a full Hox complex had already evolved before the es­tablishment of distinctive features of the major bilaterian Bauplan. De Rosa et al. (1999, p. 775) conclude their article by stating: “The subsequent bi­laterian history of Hox genes would have been primarily one of functional di­vergence and gene loss, rather than gene duplication. Regardless of the exact number of Hox genes in the bilaterian ancestor, the major period of progres­sive expansion of the Hox cluster due to tandem duplication events predated the radiation that generated the bilaterian crown phyla, concurrent with radical evolutionary changes in body architecture and development.”

As a fascinating footnote to the rich phyletic information contained in the conservation of Hox genes, the Mesozoa have long presented a deep puzzle in the study of animal phylogeny. These creatures lack body cavities and effec­tively all the characteristic organs of animals, including a gut or a nervous system. Their maximally simplified development even proceeds without gastrulation or the differentiation of germ layers. Many zoologists have there­fore considered their organization as primitive, and have even regarded the Mesozoa as a surviving key to the phyletic transition between unicellularity and the evolution of truly multicellular organization with differentiation of tissues and organs — hence their name, Mesozoa (from the Greek meso, mean­ing “middle”), as a potential intermediate between the protistans, formerly called Protozoa, and the true Metazoa. But the mesozoans are parasites of metazoans, and parasites often become extremely simplified in phenotype. Thus, the opposite interpretation of descent from an ordinary and complex metazoan ancestor has remained entirely plausible. Unfortunately, the highly simplified and autapomorphic anatomy of mesozoans has provided no clues about ancestry, despite more than a century of extensive study.

But Kobayashi et al. (1999) have isolated a Hox gene, DoxC, from a dicyemid mesozoan (parasites of cephalopod renal sacs). PCR analysis shows that DoxC is an ortholog of the “middle group” Hox series. The middle group Hox genes have only been found in triploblasts, and do not exist in Cnidaria. Hence, these data would seem to validate the hypothesis that mesozoans are secondarily simplified bilaterians, and not the sole survivors of the vaunted intermediary group between protists and metazoans. Moreover, fur­ther study of DoxC affirms its orthology with the lophotrochozoan LoxS, rather than with a middle Hox gene of the ecdysozoan clade. Therefore, not only are the mesozoans revealed as simplified metazoan parasites, but we may also place the ancestry of these formerly enigmatic forms after the major split in protostome phylogeny, and into one of the two great groups as a rela­tive of platyhelminths, brachiopods, and annelids, rather than arthropods or onychophores.

These revolutionary discoveries have inspired a growing literature on the hypothetical phenotype, or at least the shared developmental architecture, of a stem bilaterian, or even a stem animal. Slack et al. (1993) tried to define a “zootype” as the “defining character, or synapomorphy” of the kingdom Animalia (p. 491), with maximal expression in ontogeny at a “phylotopic stage ... at which all major body parts are represented in their final positions as undifferentiated cell condensations ... or the stage at which all members of the phylum show the maximum degree of similarity” (loc. cit.). They base this concept on common possession of “a system of gene expression patterns, comprising the Hox cluster type genes and some others [encoding] relative position in all animals” (loc. cit.). As discussed just below, such a concept may apply to all triploblasts, but probably not to diploblasts (whose Hox homologs show some common properties of individual action, but not the in­tegrated spatial and temporal colinearity found in most triploblasts studied so far).

The less ambitious attempt to define the phenotype and organization of a common bilaterian ancestor (named Urbilateria by de Robertis and Sasai, 1996; see also Kimmel, 1996; de Robertis, 1997; and Pennisi and Roush, 1997) may be more tractable, but specific arguments about whether this com­mon ancestor had already developed recognizably modern versions of seg­ments (Kimmel, 1996), antennae, photoreceptors, or a heart (see Fig. 10-25 for a cartoon of alternative possibilities from Pennisi and Roush, 1997) — with obvious implications for views about the homology of adult phenotypes, beyond the already established homology of underlying generators — are, in my opinion, premature.

For example, in a challenging proposal, Arendt et al., 2001, propose a homologous origin for tube-shaped guts of primary larvae in both protostomes and deuterostromes — structures long granted an independent origin in con­ventional evolutionary thinking. They base their argument upon “the shared, and very specific, expression of brachyury in ventral developing foreguts of the starfish bipinnaria, echinoid pluteus, enteropneust tornaria and polychaete trochophore larva,” suggesting “common ancestry (homology) of lar­val foreguts in Protostomia and Deuterostomia, despite the different develop­mental origin of these structures” (p. 84). The authors then claim additional support from equally specific actions of two other developmental genes — a common expression of goosecoid in the foreguts of various bilaterians, and of otx along pre- and postoral ciliary bands. As an obvious point of contention, these putative homologies, if expressive of common ancestry, require that primary larvae be regarded as the basal anatomical form of bilaterian ani­mals — a hypothesis supported by some (Peterson and Davidson, 2000, for example), but vigorously rejected by others (Valentine and Collins, 2000, for example).

We cannot yet determine — if genetic and developmental data of modern organisms could allow us, in principle, to resolve such questions at all — whether a hypothetical urbilaterian already possessed highly developed phenotypic structures (in either larvae or adults) acting like the Corinthian columns of my metaphor on pages 1134–1142, or whether this common an­cestor had only expressed its extensive genetic and developmental pathways, preserved forever after as homologies in all bilaterian phyla, as phenotypic Pharaonic bricks of limited specification and extensive flexibility. The solu­tion to such puzzles requires paleontological data (not yet available, but emi­nently attainable in principle). In any case, I regard this issue as a largely spec­ulative sidelight that does not affect — and must not lead us to forget or put aside — the striking reformulation of evolutionary theory implied by the well-documented genetic and developmental homologies alone. De Robertis ex­presses this key argument in the final line of his 1997 article on the ancestry of segmentation: “The realization that all Bilateria are derived from a com­plex ancestor represents a major change in evolutionary thinking, suggesting that the constraints imposed by the previous history of species played a greater role in the outcome of animal evolution than anyone would have pre­dicted until recently.”

The Hox genes of diploblasts apparently do not show the intergenic or­ganization of colinearity that defines the key developmental homology of bilaterians, but cnidarians do possess Hox genes with some commonality of action to their bilaterian homologs. Martinez et al. (1998) found four Hox

genes among various Cnidaria, corresponding to one medial group precursor, the anterior Drosophila genes labial and proboscipedia, and the posterior Abdominal-B (see also Miller and Miles, 1993). But even though these cnidarian genes follow the same 3' to 5' order as their bilaterian homologs, no evidence exists for colinearity of action in the development of any body struc­ture (particularly the oralaboral axis). Moreover, cnidarians apparently lack several key bilaterian Hox elements. Martinez et al. (1998, p. 748) write that “the genes in the middle of the [bilaterian] Hox clusters form a monophyletic group that includes no cnidarian genes. This is most readily explained by der­ivation of these genes through duplication of a single precursor after the ori­gin of Cnidaria.”

A fascinating study by Cartwright et al. (1999), however, does affirm some general similarity of Hox action in cnidarians and bilaterians by demonstrat­ing a formative role for cnidarian Hox in specification of the oral-aboral axis in two distantly related hydrozoans, Hydra itself and Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus. (This single cnidarian Hox gene, Cnox-2, specifies full differ­entiation along the oral-aboral axis of polyps, whereas the sequential colinear activation of the full bilaterian Hox suite specifies differentiation along the bilaterian AP axis — thus illustrating once again that the primary novelty of bilaterian origins resides in the spatial sequence of Hox genes and the evolu­tion of their coordinated action. We have, in any case, no reason to view the cnidarian oral-aboral axis as homologous to the AP axis of bilaterians.)

The study of Cartwright et al. gains strength from the multiple possibilities for natural and laboratory experiments inherent in the fourfold polymor­phism of Hydractinia polyps, and in the ease of experimental transformation of one type into another. The “normal” feeding polyp of Hydractinia, the gastrozooid, corresponds to that of Hydra, and shows full oral-aboral differ­entiation from the distal mouth and hypostome to the body column and foot at the proximal end. In both Hydra and Hydractinia, Cnox-2 is expressed at high levels in the foot and body column and at successively lower levels up the axis towards the head, which shows very weak Cnox-2 expression.

But Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus also develops three polymorphic vari­ants; clearly interpretable as intensifications of either the oral or aboral ends of the main polypary axis (see Fig. 10-26). Gonozooids and dactylozooids are specialized, respectively, for sexual reproduction and for capturing eggs of the colony's hermit crab host. Both lack a hypostome and tentacles and seem to represent “an expansion of the body column to the exclusion of oral regions” (Cartwright et al., 1999, p. 2183). The authors found “no detectable differ­ence in Cnox-2 expression along the aboral-oral axis in either the gonozooid or dactylozooid” (p. 2185), and general levels of expression equaled those found at the base of the gastrozooid — thus affirming the anatomical inference that both polymorphs develop by extending the specialized aboral end of the axis to the full length of the polyp, and suppressing the head region entirely.

In satisfying contrast, a fourth polymorph, the tentaculozooid that plays a role in defending the colony, resembles a single gastrozooid tentacle, and therefore appears to represent “all head” — an expanded part of the oral end only, with the aboral end suppressed. Cartwright et al. (1999) found very weak expression of Cnox-2 throughout the full length of tentaculozooids “at approximately the same level seen in the tentacles of gastrozooids” (p. 2185).

In an additional affirmation by experimental manipulation, dactylozooids can be removed from the colony and induced thereby to transform into gastrozooids. Cnox-2 expression initially decreased in the developing hypostome of the transforming polyp, and then in the tentacle region, but not at the aboral end, “until ultimately, dactylozooids that fully transformed into gastrozooids displayed aboral-oral Cnox-2 expression patterns indistinguish­able from that of normal gastrozooids” (p. 2185).

I believe that this crucial discovery about early emplacement of key developmental patterns — at least in bilaterian ancestry (and to a lesser extent in all animals) — combined with a central fact of timing in phylogeny, establishes a framework for understanding the primary importance of historical con­straint, and of formalist (or internalist) perspectives in general, for explicat­ing both the subsequent pathways of animal evolution and the resulting, markedly inhomogeneous habitation of potential morphospace in the history of life. Three logically connected and sequential arguments (presented as the last three sections of this final movement) combine to reset the balance of structure and function, or constraint and selection, in evolutionary theory —

so that structure and constraint, the formerly disfavored and neglected first terms of each pairing, can achieve the same attention and respect that we properly accord to the proven potency of Darwinian forces represented by the second term in each pairing.





SETTING OF HISTORICAL CONSTRAINTS IN THE CAMBRIAN EXPLO­SION. Hughes (2000, p. 65) has expressed this cardinal discovery of evo-devo in phyletic and paleontological terms: “It is hard to escape the suspicion that what we witness in the Cambrian is mainly tinkering with developmental systems already firmly established by the time these Cambrian beasts showed up.” As a reminder for non-paleontologists, all major bilaterian phyla with conspicuously fossilizable hard parts make their first appearance in the fossil record within the remarkably short interval (5-10 million years, but probably near or below the lower value) of the so-called Cambrian explosion (535-525 million years ago). (The single exception, the Bryozoa, first appear in the sub­sequent Ordovician Period.)

Unfortunately, however, as the data of molecular phylogeny accumulate, a conceptual error has begun to permeate the field, and to stymie the integra­tion of this new source with direct information from the fossil record of early animal life, a field that has also enjoyed a renaissance in both methodology and discovery during the past twenty years (Gould, 1989c; Conway Morris, 1998; Knoll and Carroll, 1999). Although some molecular estimates for the divergence times of animal phyla correspond closely with the Cambrian ex­plosion itself — Ayala et al. (1998), for example, cite 670 million years for the chordate vs. echinoderm division within deuterostomes — the majority of sources posit a much earlier set of divisions, deeply within Precambrian times. Wray et al. (1996) give 1.2 billion for protostomes vs. deuterostomes, and 1.0 billion for echinoderms vs. chordates; while Bromham et al. (1998) calculate confidence intervals broadly consistent with Wray et al.'s earlier dates. The 680 million year upper bound of their intervals (with much older means, of course) still suggests a minimal splitting age at least 150 million years before the explosion itself.

I do not possess the requisite skills to evaluate these different estimates, and the current literature seems too labile for a confident conclusion in any case. But I can assert that proponents of the older dates have muddied conceptual waters by supposing that their deeply Precambrian splitting times somehow either invalidate, or at least strongly compromise, the reality of the Cambrian explosion. For example, Wray et al. (1996) write: “Our results cast doubt on the prevailing notion that the animal phyla diverged explosively during the Cambrian or late Vendian, and instead suggest that there was an extended pe­riod of divergence ... commencing about a billion years ago.”

Bromham et al. (1998) codify this fallacy by inventing a straw man called “the Cambrian explosion hypothesis,” defined as a claim “that the phyla and even classes of the animal kingdom originated in a rapid evolutionary radia­tion at the base of the Cambrian” (p. 12386). They then present their early splitting dates as a refutation of this conjecture: “We can use our results to confidently reject the Cambrian explosion hypothesis, which rests on a literal interpretation of the fossil record” (p. 12388). Of this paleontological record, they conclude (p. 12388): “It seems probable that metazoan diversity is re­corded for the first time in the Cambrian because of a combination of ideal fossilization conditions and the advent of hard parts, or larger bodies, or both, that make many animal lineages 'visible' in the fossil record.”

But I don't know a single paleontologist who would ever have formulated such a “Cambrian explosion hypothesis” — if only because the claim makes no logical sense, and can be confuted, in any case, by well-known paleonto­logical data. Paleontologists have never regarded the Cambrian explosion as a genealogical event — that is, as the actual time of initial splitting for bilaterian phyla from a single common ancestor that, so to speak, crawled across the Precambrian-Cambrian boundary all by its lonesome. The Cam­brian explosion, as paleontologists propose and understand the concept, marks an anatomical transition in the overt phenotypes of bilaterian organ­isms — that is, a geologically abrupt origin of the major Bauplane of bilaterian phyla and classes — not a claim about times of initial phyletic branching. The facts of the Cambrian explosion remain quite agnostic with respect to the two views about branching times now contending in the literature — Ayala et al.'s (1998) claim for divisions quite near the anatomical explosion, and Wray et al.'s (1996) and Bromham et al.'s (1998) argument for earlier splittings more than a billion years ago. After all, genealogical splitting and anatomical diver­gence of basic design represent quite different (albeit related) phenomena with no necessarily strict correlation, as exemplified in the following analogy:

If a group of Martian paleontologists had visited the earth during the Eocene epoch, they would have encountered two coexisting, and scarcely dis­tinguishable, species of the genus Hyracotherium. If they had then followed the subsequent history of the lineages, they would have watched one species differentiate into the clade of rhinoceroses and the other into the clade of horses. But if a modern commentator then concluded that horses and rhinos had existed as distinct designs in their modern form (lithe runners vs. horned behemoths) since the Eocene, we would laugh at such a silly confusion, and point out that splitting times cannot be equated with completed anatomical divergence — especially under conventional views of Darwinian gradualism! After all, the Eocene visitors had only observed two effectively identical cous­ins, and could not have known that each would serve as progenitor for a highly distinct clade.

Similarly, the facts of the Cambrian explosion cannot distinguish whether — to continue with my earlier image — one tiny worm, or ten tiny worms, crawled across the Cambrian boundary as bilaterian precursors. The Cam­brian explosion, as an anatomical argument, merely holds that if ten Precambrian worms formed the pool of Cambrian ancestors, they probably looked as alike as those two Hyracotherium species that engendered horses and rhinos.

I do not claim that the issue of one vs. ten tiny worms holds no relevance for other aspects of evolutionary theory, but only that the factuality of the Cambrian explosion as an anatomical episode in the differentiation of Bauplane remains equally comfortable with either genealogical alternative. The question of one vs. ten does, however, bear strongly upon the important question of internal vs. external triggers for the explosion. If only one lineage generated all Cambrian diversity, then an internal trigger based upon some genetic or developmental “invention” becomes plausible. But unless lateral transfer can be validated at this multicellular level, or unless inventions of this magnitude can be so massively and coincidentally convergent, then the trans­formation of 10 tiny worms into the larger and well-differentiated Bauplane of Cambrian phyla suggests an external trigger — the hypothesis traditionally favored by paleontologists in any case. (The venerable oxygen hypothesis maintains pride of ancestry, but the recent claim for melting of a “snowball earth” sometime before the Cambrian transition may well represent an even more plausible environmental trigger — see Hoffman et al., 1998; Hyde et al., 2000.)

In any case, and pace Bromham et al., the argument for the reality of the Cambrian explosion as an anatomical event does not depend upon the purely negative evidence of unfound fossil complexity in earlier strata, but includes several strongly positive paleontological assertions. In Darwin's time, and for nearly 100 years thereafter until the 1950's, the Precambrian fossil record stood entirely and embarrassingly blank. But paleontologists have not kept their subsequent discoveries hidden as a trade secret, and the richness of our current Precambrian record, particularly for the 100 million years preceding the Cambrian explosion, has been widely reported (Conway Morris, 1998; Gould, 1989c; McMenamin and McMenamin, 1990, for just a few among several entire books, written for general audiences on the subject). Thus, the absence of complex bilaterians before the Cambrian explosion rests upon ex­tensive examination of appropriate sediments replete with other kinds of fos­sils, and located on all continents.

For example, the earth's first prominent assemblage of animals, named the Ediacara fauna for the Australian locality of its first discovery but now known from all continents, lived from about 600 million years ago right up to the explosion, with perhaps a few forms surviving beyond. These large creatures (up to a meter in length in one case, though most specimens occupy the range of centimeters to decimeters) tend to be highly flattened in form, composed of numerous sections that seem to be “quilted” together (certainly not segmented in any metameric way), and appear to possess no body open­ings. Although some researchers have sought the origin of a few bilaterian phyla within this fauna (Fedonkin and Waggoner, 1997), the comparisons seem farfetched and many paleontologists regard the Ediacaran animals as an early expression of pre-bilaterian possibilities of diploblast design (with mod­ern cindarians and a few other groups surviving as a remnant of this fuller di­versity), while other experts have regarded them as an entirely separate (and failed) experiment in multicellular life (Seilacher, 1989) or even as a group of marine lichen (Retallak, 1993)!

In any case, these Ediacaran fossils are soft bodied, and their preservation on all continents surely suggests that any coeval bilaterians with hard parts (or even with soft anatomy to match the Ediacarans) should be easily col­lectable. We do, in fact, have strong evidence for bilaterian presence in late Precambrian times, but not in a form that would lead us to postulate the ana­tomical complexity and specificity that first appears in the Cambrian explo­sion itself. Xiao et al. (1998) reported the discovery of embryos representing the blastomeres of the first few cleavage stages of apparent bilaterians (from rocks about 570 million years old, in early Ediacaran times), and from strata with a style of phosphatic replacement that can only preserve such tiny or­ganisms. (See Chen et al., 2000, for expansion and corroboration of this in­terpretation.)

More importantly, paleontologists have documented a fairly rich record of benthic tracks and trails (but no body fossils) that could not have been made by the sessile or planktonic Ediacaran organisms and have, by consensus of all experts, been regarded as bilaterian in origin. But — and here's the rub — these trackways are very small, measuring 5 mm in diameter at a maximum, with most only 1 mm or so in width (see Valentine and Collins, 2000). More­over, these tracks and trails do not extend deeply into Precambrian time. Hughes (2000, p. 64) states: “Traces made by bilaterians extend back to about 550 million years at least, but earlier sediments are famous for their undisturbed sedimentary lamination. The rise of animals able to mine organic resources in sediments in complex ways officially defines the base of the Cam­brian.”

Thus, positive evidence indicates only a late Precambrian origin for bilater­ians of any kind. The same data imply that all Precambrian bilaterians ranged in size from the microscopic to the barely visible, and that the Cambrian boundary marks a real and geologically sudden appearance of both large complex bilaterian body fossils, and a major change in the size and complex­ity of their tracks and trails (Knoll and Carroll, 1999). We must then ask whether, in our highly non-fractal and allometric world, the anatomical com­plexity underlying and potentiating the scope of the Cambrian explosion could have originated in such tiny animals. (The fact that substantial com­plexity can be retained in some miniaturized offshoots of large bilaterians does not permit the reverse inference of initial invention at such small sizes.)

Most experts have argued that the complexity and diversity of bilaterian anatomy, as achieved in the Cambrian explosion, could not have evolved in creatures limited to a few mm at most in their major body axis. (Moreover, the simplicity of Precambrian tracks and trails also suggests limited styles of motion and feeding strategies in the tiny creatures that made the trace fossils.) The most popular and interesting conjecture for a biological trigger to a non-artifactual Cambrian explosion (Davidson et al., 1995; Peterson et al., 1997; Peterson and Davidson, 2000) calls upon markedly increased body size po­tentiated by the evolution of set-aside cells — a mechanism that permitted the tiny and anatomically simple ancestral bilaterians to circumvent ancient con­straints of size and to enter a domain of magnitude where modern anatomical complexity could evolve. (But see Valentine and Collins, 2000, who challenge Davidson et al.'s key assumption that the tiny larvae of indirectly developing modern bilaterians represent plesiomorphic models for ancestral adults be­fore the evolution of set-aside cells.)

Thus, given that the Cambrian explosion was a real event, and that the ba­sic homologies and developmental rules of bilaterian design (particularly as manifested in the spatial and temporal colinearity of hoxology) had already been established in the ancestors of the explosion (those one to ten tiny worms, if you will), then we may infer that bilaterian diversity unfolded along the channels of developmental patterns held in common from the be­ginning of this holophyletic clade. Bilaterian diversity, in other words, repre­sents an extensive set of modifications and tinkerings upon a basic pattern set by history at the outset, and then adumbrated in one geologically brief episode to establish all fundamental building plans. Forever after, for more than half a billion years, the subsequent evolution of complex animals — that is, all bilaterian history since the Cambrian explosion — has been restricted to much more limited permutation within the confines of these early, congealed de­signs (however glorious and richly varied the range of ecological results).

Once we accept these premises, one broad question, rather more philo­sophical in nature and famously contentious given the assumptions of our cultural histories and our anthropophilic propensities, must be aired (see Gould, 1989c, and Conway Morris, 1998, for the alternative positions, and also our explicit debate in Conway Morris and Gould, 1998): If the basic de­velopmental patterns of bilaterians arose quickly, and have remained fixed in basic form since then, do these historical invariants represent a set of mechan­ically limited and excellent, perhaps even optimal, designs that natural selec­tion would have established in much the same way at any time and under any ecological or geological regime? Or do they represent just one possible solu­tion among numerous entirely plausible alternatives of strikingly different form, each yielding a subsequent history of life entirely different from the outcome actually experienced on earth? In the second alternative, life's his­tory unfolds with much of the unpredictability and contingency so famously displayed, for example, in the history of human cultural diversity — and the accident of a common developmental starting point for subsequent bilaterian diversity then assumes even more importance as a golden happenstance di­rectly responsible for the particulars of the world we know.

Historical constraint based on developmental homology assumes great importance in either case, but if the particular constraints that actually set the channels of bilaterian diversity could only have arisen within a narrow range of basically similar and workable states, then much of life's pageant unfolds by predictable regularities of natural selection. If, however, the developmen­tal plans actually established in the Cambrian explosion — albeit eminently workable, and therefore exploited by natural selection to build the particu­lars of life's later successes and failures — represent only one contingently-achieved set among a broad realm of alternatives (each “equally pleasing” to natural selection), then life's actual pageant on earth becomes highly unpre­dictable, and the happenstance of a realized beginning (the historical con­straints of bilaterian developmental homology) assumes a far more promi­nent role in shaping the subsequent history of life.

My own arguments for contingency have been well aired (Gould, 1989c; see subsequent debate on the key technical issue in Gould, 1991a; Briggs et al., 1992, with response by Foote and Gould, 1992), and this debate only ad­dresses the role of historical constraints in setting the actual pathways of life's singular history on earth, and not the existence of the constraints themselves (the subject of this section). Thus, I will not discuss the important question of predictability vs. contingency much further, except to clarify the problem by noting that questions of contingency enter our understanding of evolutionary pattern at two levels of inquiry about the Cambrian explosion and its conse­quences.

First, we must ask if the basic bilaterian homologies themselves, partic­ularly the Hox rules, represent an optimal solution that natural selection would have constructed in any case, or a workable happenstance among many alternatives. The very fact that some homonomous bilaterian phyla possess a complete complement of Hox genes, and that the original function of these genes therefore cannot match their present role in controlling the various downstream cascades that specialize and differentiate the sequence of structures along the AP axis, speaks strongly for contingency — because current utilities must therefore represent cooptations from different original functions, rather than primary adaptations. Such cooptation, expressing the principle of “quirky functional shift” (see Chapter 11, pp. 1218–1229 for full discussion), inevitably suggests (but admittedly does not prove) a high degree of fortuity, as implied by the required capacity of features built for one func­tion to act in another way that could not have influenced or regulated their original construction by any functional evolutionary mechanism like natural selection.

In this particular case, for example, Deutsch and Le Guyader (1998) have suggested a historically prior function for Hox (and other zootype) genes in designing “an appropriate neuronal network in bilaterian animals” (p. 713). Recognizing the relevance of this idea to the issue of contingency and the Cambrian explosion (1998, p. 716), they write: “Hence, the presence, before the Cambrian explosion, of a large number of Hox genes, whose domains of activity extend from the post-oral head to the abdomen, cannot be accounted for by a function in driving morphological diversity. Another role has to be assumed for the ancestral function of the Hox genes. We postulate that the zootype genes primitively specified neural identity.”

Second, we must ask if the realized variants that congealed so quickly as specialized and differentiated body plans (the major bilaterian Bauplane) — permitting no further origin of novel anatomies sufficiently distinct to war­rant taxonomic recognition as phyla — represent a predictable set of “best so­lutions” within the broad possibilities of historical constraint permitted by shared developmental rules? Or do they constitute a subset of workable, but basically fortuitous, survivals among a much larger set that could have func­tioned just as well, but either never arose, or lost their opportunities, by his­torical happenstance? I admit my partisanship for the latter position (Gould, 1989c) and freely acknowledge that my judgments have won some support, but no consensus to say the least (Conway Morris, 1998). I would only point out that even the strongest opponents of contingency admit that arthropod disparity (the measured range of anatomical designs, not the number of spe­cies) had reached a fully modern range in the Burgess Shale faunas (Middle Cambrian, about 10 million years after the explosion) — and that more than 500 million years of additional arthropod evolution has not expanded the scope of anatomical disparity at all (Briggs et al., 1992; Foote and Gould, 1992, present evidence for the counter view that Cambrian disparity ex­ceeded modern levels, despite much lower species diversity). I would also urge my colleagues to spend more time studying Cambrian “oddballs” that do not easily fit into recognized higher taxa, including Xidazoon among “or­phan” taxa (Shu et al., 1999), or Fuxianhuia among arthropods that do not belong to any recognized class (Chen et al., 1995), and not to focus so strongly, as most studies have done in recent years, upon cladistic attempts to place all Cambrian forms at least into the stem regions of major phyla, if shared derived markers of crown groupings bar their entry — a strategy that leads researchers to ignore the autapomorphies of these peculiar taxa, and to coax other features into plesiomorphy with modern taxa.





CHANNELING THE SUBSEQUENT DIRECTIONS OF BILATERIAN HISTORY FROM THE INSIDE. If the bilaterian ancestor possessed a full complement of Hox genes, and if all major variants upon this initial system had already con­gealed by the end of the Cambrian explosion, then subsequent bilaterian evo­lution must unfold within the secondary strictures of these realized specializa­tions upon an underlying plan already channeled by primary constraints of the common ancestral pattern. But lest we begin to suspect that rigid limita­tion must represent the major evolutionary implication of such constraint, I must reemphasize the positive aspect of constraint as fruitful channeling along lines of favorable variation that can accelerate or enhance the work of natural selection. Moreover, the evolutionary flexibility of developmental channels achieves its most impressive range — as Chapter 11 will discuss as its primary subject — through the crucial principle of cooptation, or the extensive and inherent capacity of genes evolved for one particular function to operate, through evolutionary redeployment, in strikingly different adaptive ways.

Among “higher” triploblast phyla of markedly divergent design, echinoderms represent the obvious test case for studying the flexibility of homolo­gous developmental genes. With their remarkable autapomorphies of radial symmetry, calcitic endoskeleton, and a water vascular system for circulation, how could these creatures evolve within the confines of a genetic regulatory system that builds bilaterial, axially specialized organisms with blood vascu­lar systems in both their immediate sister phylum (the vertebrates) and in plesiomorphic taxa of more distant common ancestry (the protostome phyla on both major branches). Did echinoderms delete their ancestral determi­nants to evolve such an aberrant morphology or did they acquire entirely new regulatory genes and developmental rules?

Few data now exist to address this important issue, but preliminary results suggest that echinoderms have retained their genetic homologies with other bilaterian phyla, while coopting several of these genes (with stable function in other phyla) for different roles in their own unique development. In a pio­neering study, Lowe and Wray (1997) documented the expression in echino­derms of orthologs of three important regulatory genes that encode transcrip­tion factors with a homeodomain, and that generally function in the same broad way in both vertebrates and arthropods (and must therefore be plesiomorphic to any derived condition in echinoderms): distal-less for proximo-distal patterning in outgrowth of limbs, engrailed for neurogenesis along the axis of the CNS, and orthodenticle for the differentiation of anterior structures.

Lowe and Wray documented a full spectrum of results, ranging from reten­tion to cooption for markedly different echinoderms roles. At an extreme of retention, the brittle star Amphipholis squamata expresses engrailed in neuronal cell bodies along the five radial nerves. Lowe and Wray note (1997, pp. 719-720): “This expression is superficially similar to that in bilaterial an­imals, in which engrailed is expressed within a serially repeated subset of ganglionic neurons along the antero-posterior axis. It is possible that a neurogenic role for engrailed is widely conserved among triploblastic animals.”

In the intermediary state of a retained general role transferred to novel or­gans, sea urchins express distal-less at the distal ends of the five primary po­dia (tube feet) soon after their formation — thus preserving the standard func­tion of regulating outgrowths from a body axis by expression at their distal tips, but now applied to an autapomorphic outgrowth with no homolog in any other bilaterian phylum! Finally, at the extreme of full cooptation (for new functions in new organs), brittle stars express orthodenticle in ectoderm overlying the terminal ossicles at the ends of the arms — a position with only tenuous and hypothetical connection to the anterior end of the AP axis in bilaterian phyla. Moreover, at least for engrailed and orthodenticle (the copy-number of distal-less remains undetermined in echinoderms), only one ortholog exists in any echinoderm studied so far — so new functions cannot be ascribed to the cooptation of duplicated copies.

Lowe and Wray's final statement (1997, p. 721) emphasizes the important conclusion that genetic and developmental homologies of triploblast animals still permit enormous flexibility in evolutionary diversification — primarily by the principle of cooptation: “The highly derived body architecture of echino­derms evolved at least in part through extensive modifications in the roles and expression domains of regulatory genes inherited from their bilaterial an­cestors. Even the limited number of genes and species we examined demon­strates a remarkable evolutionary flexibility in genes that have previously been considered interesting mainly for their conserved roles in arthropods and chordates.”

If we now turn our attention to these “conserved roles in arthropods and chordates,” at least three sources of evidence underscore the central con­clusion of this section: that the evolution of differentiated and specialized Bauplane from a presumably homonomous common ancestor proceeds — paradoxically, and contrary to the scenario of Lewis's (1978) original hypoth­esis about Hox genes — by reduction and restriction, rather than by addition of genes or expansion of their domains of activity.

1. Specialization of anatomy sometimes correlates with deletion or unem­ployment of Hox genes, or their redeployment to other functions. For exam­ple, Zen, the insect ortholog (in both structure and position) to vertebrate Hox3, exhibits no Hox function and is not expressed along the AP axis of the developing larva, but plays some role instead in the formation of extra-embryonic membranes. In a paper that wins, by acclamation, the Steinbeckian prize for title parodies (“Of mites and Zen”), Telford and Thomas (1998) cloned the homolog of Drosophila Zen in the orbatid mite Archegozetes. They found expression of this chelicerate homolog “in a discrete antero-posterior region of the body with an anterior boundary coinciding with that of the chelicerate homolog of the Drosophila Hox gene proboscipedia” (p. 591). This fascinating result suggests that zen may have lost its Hox func­tion in Drosophila as a consequence of functional redundancy due to overlap with another Hox gene.

Taking the argument further, Telford and Thomas present evidence that the Drosophila pair-rule gene fushi tarazu may also be “a divergent Hox gene that has adopted a new role” (p. 594; see also Dawes et al., 1994, on a locust homolog of fushi tarazu that shows no pair-rule function). These observa­tions on the original roles of Drosophila zen and fushi tarazu suggest “that the original complement of arthropod Hox genes must be revised from eight to ten” (Telford and Thomas, 1998, p. 594), thus emphasizing the role of gene loss in the specialization of body plans.

2. Stasis or slow change in Hox genes indicates their conserved role in evolution. Akam et al. (1994), in a section of their paper entitled “Hox genes that got away,” contrast the conservation of Hox genes in insects (as docu­mented by high levels of sequence similarity among taxa) with much higher rates of divergence in homeobox genes that do not now function within the Drosophila Hox series, but may have belonged to the Hox cluster of an ar­thropod common ancestor: the maternally expressed bicoid (encoding the morphogen that produces a crucial AP gradient in the early syncytial em­bryo), the pair-rule gene fushi tarazu, and the two zen genes. The putative orthologs of fushi tarazu in other insects “are almost unrecognizable outside of their homeodomains, and have accumulated approximately 10 times as many changes in their homeodomains as have homeotic [i.e., Hox] genes in the same comparisons” (Akam et al., 1994, p. 209). The authors then gener­alize about these non-Hox homeobox genes (p. 214): “We think that these genes may be derived . . . from Hox genes which, in the lineage leading to Drosophila, have escaped from the conservative selection that characterizes homeotic genes.”

3. Overexpression, in both position and amount, of vertebrate Hox genes has generated atavisms in several experiments, thus suggesting that derived specializations evolve by tighter regionalization and restriction of expression in individual Hox genes. Pollock et al. (1995) studied the influence of over-expression for Hoxb-8 and Hoxc-8 upon the skeletal development of mice, concluding that “many of the morphological consequences of expanding the mesodermal domain and magnitude of expression of either gene were atavis­tic” (p. 4492). For example, the earliest Paleozoic vertebrates grew “free ribs” (independent from and articulating with the vertebrae) along the entire body axis, from the base of the skull to the tail. Many subsequent tetrapod lineages, particularly among mammals, reduced the number of free ribs dra­matically. But vestiges of the ancestral free ribs sometimes remain as small units fused with the vertebrae. In particular, the lumbar pleurapophyses of posterior mammalian vertebrae “most likely represent an ancestral rib that has fused with the lateral portion of the vertebrae and now serves as a point of attachment for muscle groups of the back” (p. 4495). Pollock et al. (1995) documented “the reappearance of free ribs at the expense of lumbar pleurapophyses” in Hoxb-8 transgenic mice — “a clear example of atavism” (p. 4495). In another experiment, mice developing with overexpression of both Hoxb-8 and Hoxc-8 grew costal tubercles on their lower thoracic ribs. Costal tubercles represent a vestige of the second head of the articulating boss in free ribs. Normal mice develop no costal tubercles on these ribs at all.

In a similar experiment, Lufkin et al. (1992) ectopically expressed a Hoxd gene “more rostrally than its normal mesoderm anterior boundary of expres­sion” (p. 835) at the level of the first cervical somites. This anomalous ante­rior expression generated “a homeotic transformation of the occipital bones towards a more posterior phenotype into structures that resemble cervical vertebrae” (p. 835). One should not read too much evolutionary meaning into one experimental manipulation, but since the same ectopic expression also induced other changes of a potentially atavistic nature (particularly “the presence of clearly segmented neural arches arising from the most anterior so­mites,” p. 840), and since the vertebrate skull and forebrain probably arose as novel features at the anterior end of a more homonomous ancestor, any transformation of skull parts towards the phenotype of more homonomous posterior vertebrae can hardly fail to elicit thoughts about the phylogeny of the vertebrate skull — especially when these potential atavisms arise by revers­ing the presumed phyletic restriction and posterior localization of Hox ac­tion. Lufkin et al. (1992), in what I can only regard as an expression of chutz­pah (but still worth pondering), even ask: “Would ectopic expression of additional Hox genes be required to convert fully the neurocranium into ver­tebrae?” (p. 840).

Pollock et al. (1995, pp. 4495-4496) also reach a bold conclusion that may go too far, but that merits careful consideration:

The observation that expansion of the functional domain of a Hox gene can result in the transformation of a modern costal structure to a more ancient form suggests that regional repression of Hox gene expression could have played a role in the evolution of the vertebral column . . . We propose that, in antecedent vertebrates, Hox genes involved in pat­terning the axial skeleton were expressed in relatively broad regions of paraxial mesoderm. The resulting less complex Hox code would have es­tablished the similar vertebral identities observed in broad regions of early vertebrate skeletons. Regionalization of the vertebral column sub­sequently evolved in concert with the evolution of restricted patterns of Hox gene expression in paraxial mesoderm.



When we turn to specific examples in the evolution of differentiated and complexified axial structures in arthropods and vertebrates, we commonly find correlations between morphological inventions and the restriction and regionalization of Hox gene expression. I have already discussed several cases in previous sections of this chapter — particularly the complex and elegantly documented story of multiple parallel evolution of crustacean maxillipeds from ancestral limbs that were more homonomous with the rest of the poste­rior thoracic series. This complexification originates by suppression of Ubx and abdA in just those anterior thoracic segments that develop maxillipeds in each case.

Enlarging upon this example, Averof and Akam (1995) found that three middle Hox genes — Antp, Ubx and abdA — “are expressed in largely overlap­ping domains in the uniform thoracic region” of branchiopod crustaceans (1995, p. 420, and see Fig. 10-27). In the more highly differentiated insects, on the other hand, the same three genes show more restricted expression in discrete domains, where “they specify distinct segment types within the tho­rax and abdomen” (p. 420). In particular, Antp turns on in thoracic segments (that develop legs and wings) but not in abdominal segments. Similarly, both Vbx and abdA are expressed in all abdominal segments, where they repress distal-less and therefore presumably regulate the repression of legs on all ab­dominal segments.

In an elegant affirmation that has already become a classic of the evo-devo literature, Warren et al. (1994) demonstrated that lepidopteran larvae de­velop prolegs on their abdominal segments by localized deletion of Ubx and abdA expression, followed by subsequent derepression of distal-less in the small bilateral patches on each abdominal segment, from which the prolegs then grow. They conclude (1994, p. 458) that “abdominal limb formation in butterflies has been made possible by the evolution of a regulatory mecha­nism for shutting off these two BX-C [Hox in modern terminology] genes in selected cell populations, which then permits Dll and Antp to be expressed.”

Warren et al. then raise an obvious question that exemplifies a related prin­ciple in the evolution of differentiated complexity from homonomous ances­try: Why didn't butterflies evolve their abdominal prolegs by the “easier” route of fixing a Dll mutation to release repression by Ubx and abdA? Why follow the more complex scenario of first repressing the two Hox genes in lo­cal patches, and then permitting the ordinary action of Dll? Warren et al. offer the reasonable explanation that derepression of Dll will not be sufficient, by itself, to build a full proleg. A much more extensive cascade of down­stream genes generates the proleg (presumably with a crucial boost from Dll) — and upstream Hox repression must be released in order to potentiate the full downstream cascade. Thus, differentiation from homonomy may pro­ceed either by regionalizing and restricting the Hox genes themselves, or by altering and specializing the downstream cascades regulated by Hox genes.

As a further example of this second process, Warren et al. (1994) also documented the absence of Ubx from Drosophila wing imaginal discs, whereas Ubx occurs at high levels in the section of the dorsal metathoracic disc that generates the halteres (markedly reduced wings that function as balancing or­gans) on the third thoracic segment. This observation led to the conjecture that, just as Hox genes regulate the appearance or repression of legs on par­ticular segments, Hox genes might also determine the presence or absence of wings in a similarly direct manner. Thus, if Ubx prevents full wing develop­ment in Drosophila T3, perhaps a suppression of Ubx permits the generation of a large and complete second pair of wings on the homologous T3 segment of Lepidoptera.





10-27. Relationship of morphological differentiation to restricted expression of Hox genes. From Averof and Akam, 1995. In the uniform thoracic region of bran­chiopod crustaceans, the three middle Hox genes (Antp, Ubx and abdA) have largely overlapping domains of expression (see lower left). In insects (at right) Antp is restricted to the thoracic segments that develop legs and wings, whereas Ubx and abdA are expressed in abdominal segments, where they repress distal-less and presumably regulate the nondevel­opment of legs.





But this reasonable conjecture was then falsified because, just as in dipterans, Ubx does not turn on in the lepidopteran forewing imaginal disc, but achieves high levels of expression in the hindwing disc. Therefore, the growth of lepidopteran hindwings in the presence of Ubx must depend upon differ­ences in the downstream T3 cascade of flies vs. butterflies. Warren et al. (1994, p. 461) conclude: “The most logical explanation is that the sets of downstream wing-patterning genes regulated by Ubx in these orders have di­verged. In this view, Ubx operates in butterflies upon pattern regulating genes to differentiate hindwings from forewings, and in flies upon a different set of genes to distinguish halteres from wings.”

In further confirmation from detailed patterns at lower taxonomic levels, Weatherbee et al. (1999) then studied Hindsight, a homeotic mutation in but­terflies that transforms parts of the hindwing into forewing identity. They found that these hindwing transformations in color and scale morphology oc­cur in regions of the forewing where Ubx expression has been lost, thus sensibly explaining, under the general rule for Hox expression in butterfly wings, the apparent forewing identities of these altered regions. Reemphasizing the important principle previously illustrated for echinoderms vs. other triploblast phyla, but at this lower taxonomic level — that channels of internal homology also promote flexibility, not just limitation, through such mecha­nisms as cooptation and diversification of downstream cascades — Weather-bee et al. (1999, p. 113) write: “The diversity of insect hindwing patterns illustrates the broad range of possible morphologies that can evolve in ho­mologous structures that are regulated by the same Hox gene.”

I turn, finally, to the two canonical and most anatomically extensive exam­ples of evolution from homonomy to regional specialization and complexity in the evolution of insects and other arthropods — evolution from the plesiomorphic state of walking legs on all post-oral segments and, for pterygotes, from the ancestral condition (as revealed in the fossil record and preserved in modern mayfly larvae) of wings on all thoracic and abdominal segments. Data from evo-devo have effectively resolved the old debate about whether insect wings evolved as novel structures from hypothesized rigid extensions of the body wall in terrestrial forebears (the paranotal theory), or from dor­sal branches of polyramous appendages of ancestral forms (the limb-exite theory).

Genetic data support the exite theory and provide a fascinating example of cooptation in evolution (the general subject of the subsequent Chapter 11). In the exite theory, insect wings and legs are, in some sense, serially homologous as specializations of different parts of an ancestral polyramous appendage — the wings from the dorsalmost branch (the exite) and the leg from the ventralmost-walking branch. In their major topological difference, wings develop as sheets, and legs as tubes. In Drosophila, the wing grows under the crucial influence of apterous, which is expressed only in dorsal cells and therefore maintains clear distinction between dorsal and ventral surfaces, thus abetting the growth of a sheet-like structure (Shubin et al., 1997). But the apterous gene does not function in the growth of tubular legs in Drosophila. However, Averof and Cohen (1997) found apterous expression in the sheet-like dorsal branch of respiratory epipodites in a branchiopod crustacean, thus support­ing the exite theory for the origin of wings. Shubin et al. (1997, p. 645) draw a reasonable phyletic conclusion consistent with this section's theme of evolu­tion from homonomy to specialization: “This suggests that Recent wings evolved from the respiratory lobe of an ancestral polyramous limb, probably first appearing in the immature aquatic stages as gill-like structures, such as those found on all trunk segments of extinct Paleodictyoptera or extant mayfly larvae.”

On the related issue of evolutionary suppression of wings on most seg­ments and their restriction to two pairs in most insects, and to one in dipterans (see Fig. 10-28), Carroll et al. (1995, p. 58) demonstrate that “wing for­mation is not promoted by any homeotic gene, but is repressed in different segments by different homeotic genes.” Against the older view (consistent with Lewis's original additive model of phenotypic complexification) that Antp positively regulates the formation of wings and halteres on T2 and T3 of Drosophila, Carroll et al. (1995) present evidence that other Hox genes re­press wing primordia on the remaining body segments. For example, Scr is expressed in both labial and Tl segments; in mutant embryos lacking Scr ex­pression, “flight appendage primordia arise in the Tl segment” (p. 58). As for suppression of more posterior wings, the oldest information about homeotic mutations in Drosophila documented the development of complete wings on T3, where the vestigial halteres usually form. We now know that this bithorax phenotype (which gave its name to the previous designation of the posterior Drosophila Hox series as the “bithorax complex” or BX-C) results from a mutation that represses the Ubx gene in T3. Another mutation of Ubx leads to the growth of wing primordia on Al as well.

Carroll et al. (1995) propose that when wings existed on all post-oral body segments of a homonomous ancestor, “there was no homeotic gene input into their number or design” (p. 59). Carroll et al. then hypothesize that elimi­nation of wings from most segments occurred as the Hox genes became





10-28. Differentiation of flight in the evolution of insects as a consequence of repression of wings on posterior segments by various Hox genes. The fossil nymph in B possessed wings on all segments. These are reduced but still present on all segments in the fossil mayfly nymph at C. From Carroll et al., 1995.





regionalized and individualized, leading to suppression by different elements in various parts of the body: “The evolution of Scr-responsive elements led to the modification or elimination of prothoracic wings and the evolution of abdA and Ubx-responsive elements led to the elimination of abdominal wings and, in the Diptera, to the reduction of metathoracic wings.”

For the most general question of specialization of appendages for a wide variety of forms and functions from their uniform state on all segments poste­rior to the head of a homonomous ancestor, several lines of evidence iden­tify walking appendages (either uniramous, or biramous with an upper gill branch) as the ancestral state for a homonomous ancestor, and as a continu­ing “ground state” for modern more differentiated forms as well. First, the most homonomous modern groups — the Myriapoda among the arthropods, and the Onychophora as a sister group to the entire arthropod phylum — bear leg-like structures on each segment. Second, numerous Cambrian arthropods that cannot be placed into modern groups share the common property of nearly identical biramous appendages on all postoral segments, and only a pair or two of antennae on any preoral segments — as in Marrella, the most common fossil in the Burgess Shale (see Fig. 10-29 and Gould, 1989c). Third, as discussed previously (pp. 1132–1134), the extensive suite of thoracic seg­ments that bear identical leg-like appendages in many modern Crustacea also show extensive and complete overlap of expression for several Hox genes.

Proceeding down the AP axis of complexified arthropods, we first note that antennae develop in the most anterior segments where no Hox expression oc­curs. This situation probably marks retention of the ancestral condition. Even the most homonomous forms, including myriapods and onychophores, exhibit some specialization in the head segments at the anterior end, and only grow identical appendages on subsequent postoral segments. Thus, the origi­nal Hox complex probably never regulated development at the extreme ante­rior end around the mouth, and antennae probably represent the plesiomorphic condition for segments with no Hox action. Interestingly, and in confirmation, the suppression of all Hox activity in Tribolium yields the lethal

consequence of a dead larva with antennae on all segments (Stuart et al., 1991; Shubin et al., 1997, p. 664; see also Cassares and Mann, 1998, on antennal-determining genes repressed by Hox action in Drosophila).

All other specializations down the AP axis are apparently derived and de­pendent upon differentiation and regionalization, or elimination in some cases, of expression in various Hox genes. For example, in gnathal segments just posterior to segments bearing antennae in many groups, the most homonomous modern forms develop mouthparts of essentially leg-like form (as in myriapods). These leg-like appendages express Distal-less at their distal tips, the typical situation for ordinary arthropod legs. But Distal-less is not expressed at the distal ends of more specialized (and non leg-like) feeding ap­pendages of insects and crustaceans. “These data,” Shubin et al. write (1997, p. 644), “agree with fossil evidence suggesting that crustacean and insect mandibles were reduced from the primitive whole-limb mandible by trunca­tion of the mandibular proximodistal axis.”

I have already discussed, in previous parts of this section, the role of Hox restrictions and repressions in the evolution of all other outstanding pheno­typic specializations in more posterior regions of arthropod bodies, includ­ing the differentiation of maxillipeds from legs on the previously homonomous crustacean thorax (pp. 1132–1134), the restriction of wings to just one or two thoracic segments in insects (p. 1165), and the complete suppres­sion of legs on the insect abdomen, with localized Hox repression to permit the growth of prolegs on the abdominal segments of lepidopteran larvae (p. 1165).

When we turn to the history of vertebrates, we first encounter an appar­ent exception to the generality that phenotypic specialization correlates with reduction in number of Hox genes and regionalization of their action. Amphioxus, the modern cephalochordate surrogate for an ancestral form, has only one Hox cluster, while gnathostome vertebrates have four — so du­plication, occurring at least twice, clearly marks a major feature of vertebrate evolution, with obvious implications for correlating the complexity of our phylum with this marked increase in the total number of Hox genes, and in apparent contradiction to the opposite relation of phenotypic elaboration with genetic restriction, as discussed throughout this section.

But the single cluster of amphioxus contains homologs of the first 10-paralogy groups of vertebrate Hox genes, arranged in the usual colinear ar­ray. Moreover, the amphioxus genome includes at least two AbdB-like genes, indicating that tandem duplication of these posterior Hox elements was al­ready underway in the cephalochordates, even though true vertebrates have carried the process further (Carroll, 1995; Coates and Cohn, 1998). There­fore, essentially the full Hox complement had already been established when the genome of an immediate vertebrate ancestor included only one set of Hox genes. Moreover, the full fourfold amplification had already been completed by the origin of jaws in early fishes because all modern gnathostomes — that is, all living species of vertebrates except for the two small lineages of agnathan fishes, the lampreys, with three Hox sets, and the hagfishes — have four sets.

Thus, the common ancestor of all 40,000 or so modern gnathostome spe­cies already had four Hox sets, and only the handful of agnathan species has fewer sets among modern vertebrates. Thus, our large clade of 40,000 species evolved under the general rule featured throughout this section: phenotypic specialization correlated with Hox deletions” and restrictions of expression. Or, to put the matter somewhat facetiously, you start with all you will ever get, and work “down” from there — an optimal formula for the evolutionary importance of historical constraint.

As Coates and Cohn (1998, p. 375) write (see also Fig. 10-30): “During the period since these gene duplication episodes, jawed vertebrate Hox clus­ter evolution seems to have been characterized by gene deletions.” Moreover, as Figure 10-30 also shows, teleost fishes, which did not originate until Mesozoic times, evolve different patterns of deletion from those found in mam­mals, a group with a Paleozoic ancestry from a very different vertebrate lin­eage — thus “indicating quite separate patterns of gene loss in tetrapod and teleost lineages” (Coates and Cohn, 1998, p. 375).

The relatively homonomous architecture of the postcranial skeleton of many early fishes (and many early tetrapods as well) has evolved in the con­ventionally “higher” tetrapods, primarily in mammals, into a more complex, specialized and regionalized axial skeleton with clear and often quite sharp distinctions, in both form and function, from cervical to thoracic to lumbar, sacral and caudal regions of the vertebral column. Burke et al. (1995) have demonstrated an interesting basis for much of this phenotypic complexity and regionalization in the establishment of definite boundaries of action for particular paralogy groups of the Hox clusters, thus repeating the general ar­thropod correlation of Hox regionalization with phenotypic specialization along the AP axis.

For example, different groups of vertebrates vary greatly in the number of vertebrae per region, but the boundary between regions may still remain





10-30. Following the evolution of four Hox clusters in vertebrates, the major pattern of change has not resulted in further addition, but rather in elimination — in different patterns in various groups. From Coates and Cohn, 1998, p. 375.





sharp (Burke et al. refer to the shifts of these boundaries to emplace more or fewer vertebrae within any given region, as “transpositions”). In their most intriguing conclusion, Burke et al. (1995) found that some of these phenotypic transitions correlate precisely with anterior expression boundaries of particular Hox genes. For example, Hoxc-6 marks the transition between cervical and thoracic vertebrae, despite the highly variable number of cervi­cal vertebrae, ranging from 3 or 4 in frogs, to 7 in mice (as in virtually all mammals, including giraffes), to 17 in geese. The thoracic-lumbar transition generally correlates with the expression of Hoxa-9, Hoxb-9, and Hoxc-9, whereas the Hoxd-9 boundary tends to be shifted backwards to the lumbosacral transition. Carroll (1995, p. 483) comments on these differences in the ninth paralogy group: “This may be significant because the thoracic-lumbar distinction is not general among tetrapods. It may be that shifts within the Hox-9 group were important in the evolution of this transition from a more uniform trunk, perhaps even in the evolution of the tetrapods from fish.”

These regularities of Hox regionalization may help us to understand both the limitations and flexibilities of vertebrate anatomy in terms of historical constraint. In an early article, for example, Tabin (1992) suggested that tetra-pod limbs may now be constrained to five digits per limb (despite the pres­ence of up to 8 digits in the earliest tetrapods of the Late Devonian Period — see Coates and Clack, 1990; and Gould, 1993e) because the Hoxd series that plays such a major role in patterning limbs may now only generate five “ad­dresses” for the development of distinct digits. Many polydactylous mutants (and experimental manipulations) exist in vertebrates, but the supernumer­aries are always phenotypic replicates of one of the five distinct digits, so the general hypothesis holds (see also Shubin et al., 1997, pp. 642-643).

A related classical question asks why tetrapods, honoring their name, never grow more than four limbs, whereas the other major terrestrial group of ar­thropods usually evolves phenotypes with more appendages (even though we might imagine, on functional grounds, that an increased number of supports would be even more valuable in large vertebrates with much lower area to volume ratios — for supporting strength of bone scales as cross-sectional area). Coates and Cohn (1998, p. 379) note that “the nearest approach to a third pair of lateral appendages may be the lateral caudal keels of certain fishes, such as tuna and various sharks.” But a true anatomical third pair has never evolved in any tetrapod or extant fish. (The extinct acanthodian fishes evolved the only vertebrate departure from the principle of two primary limb pairs.)

But as Hox rules constrain, they can also be tweaked to win interesting flexibility. Cohn and Tickle (1999), for example, studied Hox expression in the axial skeleton of pythons, which can grow more than 300 essentially identical vertebrae, and which retain hindlimb rudiments but express no forelimb development at all. Except for the atlas, every vertebra anterior to the rudimentary hindlimb develops ribs (a thoracic feature) as well as ventral hypopophyses (a cervical feature), suggesting to Cohn and Tickle (1999, p. 474) that “information encoding thoracic identity may have extended into the cervical region and partially transformed these segments. Thus the entire trunk resembles an elongated thorax.”

Cohn and Tickle studied the expression of Hoxb-5, Hoxc-6, and Hoxc-8 in the ontogeny of pythons. In both teleosts and tetrapods, the anterior expres­sion boundaries of all three genes in lateral plate mesoderm occurs “at the forelimb/pectoral fin level, where they are involved in specifying forelimb position and shoulder development” (p. 475). But pythons develop no phenotypic expression of the forelimb at all, thus suggesting that a suppression of this positional boundary, and a forward expansion of expression in these genes, might be causally related to the vast increase in number, and identity in thoracic form, of snake vertebrae — and potentially helping to explain one of the most striking functional novelties ever evolved in vertebrates.

Indeed, Cohn and Tickle (1999, p. 475) found Hoxc-8 and Hoxb-5 ex­pression “throughout the python lateral plate mesoderm, with expression terminating at the very anterior limit of the trunk. Thus, the entire vertebral column anterior to the cloaca exhibits patterns of Hox gene expression con­sistent with thoracic identity, and we were unable to detect restricted Hox ex­pression patterns in the lateral plate mesoderm associated with forelimb posi­tion in other tetrapods.” In interesting and confirming contrast, they detected a sharp posterior boundary of Hoxc-8 expression right at the level of the hindlimb rudiments, “which coincides with the last thoracic vertebra in older animals.” Their phyletic hypothesis underscores the power of constraining rules as positive channels that can be tweaked in rare and interesting ways to yield remarkable phenotypic and functional excursions into novelty — but always under the rubric of Hox rules and their potentiating, but also direc­tional, flexibilities: “Expansion of these Hox gene expression domains in both paraxial and lateral plate mesoderm may be the mechanism which trans­formed the entire snake trunk towards a thoracic/flank identity and led di­rectly to the absence of forelimb development during snake evolution” (1999, p. 475).





AN EPILOG ON DOBZHANSKY'S LANDSCAPE AND THE DOMINANT ROLE OF HISTORICAL CONSTRAINT IN THE CLUMPED POPULATION OF MORPHOSPACE. As I emphasized in setting out the varied categories and evolutionary significances of constraint (see pp. 1151–1161 and Figs. 10-10 and 10-11), the historical vertex treated in this Chapter 10 does not refute the functional or adaptational premises of traditional Darwinism by asserting a nonadaptive origin for the constraints thus generated — for this more direct challenge arises from the structural vertex that will be treated in Chapter 11. That is, I do not doubt that most, or nearly all, constraints from the historical vertex originate as direct adaptations in the ancestral taxon of their initial ap­pearance. But, having thus originated, these adaptations may then “congeal” to limit directions of potential alteration in descendant taxa (the negative meanings), or to channel future change in preferred directions that often ac­celerate or grant easier access to adaptive solutions (the positive meanings). In terms of the classical model of Galton's polyhedron, the pool cue of natural selection may always do the actual pushing, but if internal channels — set by history, and grafted into the genetic and developmental architecture of cur­rent organisms — designate a limited set of possible pathways as conduits for selection's pushing, then these internal constraints can surely claim equal weight with natural selection in any full account of the causes of any particu­lar evolutionary change.

But if the challenge posed by historical constraint to traditional Darwinian functionalism does not lie in an argument about nonadaptive origins, then how can this category of constraint rectify and expand evolutionary theory beyond the narrowness imposed by overly adaptationist versions of Darwin­ism favored during the heyday of the Modern Synthesis (see Chapter 7)?

In describing my basic framework of argument, I asserted (see pp. 1055–1057) that the challenge of historical constraint resides in a “metaquestion” about the role of adaptation in establishing the dumpiness of occupied morphospace, not in a direct inquiry about the adaptive status of each evolu­tionary novelty considered one-by-one. In short, I argued that the markedly inhomogeneous occupation of morphospace — surely one of the cardinal, most theoretically important, and most viscerally fascinating aspects of life's history on earth — must be explained largely by the limits and channels of his­torical constraint, and not by the traditional mapping of organisms upon the clumped and nonrandom distribution of adaptive peaks in our current ecological landscapes. In other words, the inhomogeneous occupation of morphospace largely records the influence of structural rules and regulari­ties emerging “from the inside” of inherited genetic and developmental sys­tems of organisms, and does not only (or even primarily) reflect the action of functional principles realized by the mechanism of natural selection imposed “from the outside.”

In a recent article, Arthur and Farrow (1999, p. 183) pose the key issue in much the same terms: “Why do animal take the forms they do, and not oth­ers? Why ... are all land vertebrates 'tetrapods' — except for cases of second­ary loss, for example snakes — while none have six, eight, or many legs? Why is the situation precisely reversed for land arthropods? In general, why are certain areas of multicellular morphospace densely populated with many rep­resentative species, while other areas, apparently characterizing viable de­signs, are unoccupied by any extant or extinct animals?” Then, although I would label their distinctions as overly dichotomized and too mutually exclu­sive (for I seek a fusion of structural and functional influences), Arthur and Farrow also pose the alternatives (1999, p. 183) in much the same manner followed here:

There are two very different answers to these questions, representing two opposing schools of thought on the relative importance of natural selection and developmental constraint in determining the actual distri­bution of morphologies that we observe ... One is the “pan-selectionist” view that variation is potentially available in all directions from any given phyletic starting-point, and that selection determines which subset of variants prevails. The alternative is the “developmental constraint” view that many of the gaps we observe between different morphologies do not arise from the non-adaptiveness of the absent forms but rather from the difficulty of making them through an ontogenetic process.



I began this “symphony” of evo-devo with a quotation from one of the great architects of the Modern Synthesis — Mayr's statement, based on adaptationist premises then both reasonable and conventional, that any search for genetic homology between distantly-related animal phyla would be doomed a priori and in theory by selection's controlling power, a mechanism that would surely recycle every nucleotide position (often several times) during so long a period of independent evolution between two lines. The new data of evo-devo have falsified this claim and revised our basic theory to admit a great, and often controlling, power for historical constraints based on conserved de­velopmental patterns coded by the very genetic homologies that Mayr had deemed impossible.

For the sake of both symmetry and logic, it seems fitting to end this section by recalling another quotation by another great architect of the Synthesis, based on the same panadaptationist assumptions about natural selection's controlling power — and also falsified, since then, by new information on his­torical constraints, impelling renewed respect for formalist themes in revising and expanding our theories of evolutionary mechanisms. But Dobzhansky's closing statement (1951) differs from Mayr's opener (1963) in one crucial way: Mayr's denial of genetic homology represented a sensible consensus for his time; whereas Dobzhansky's assertion of purely adaptational mapping upon ecological places to explain the clumpy population of morphospace made little sense, even at the height of enthusiasm for natural selection's ex­clusive power — and I can only conclude (as discussed more fully in Chapter 7, pp. 526–528) that Dobzhansky, in his enthusiasm for strict Darwinian theory, had temporarily undervalued a cardinal fact of natural history that his initial training as a systematist had certainly infused into the marrow of his understanding.

In a brilliant opening move, Dobzhansky began the third (1951) edition of his founding document for the Synthesis, Genetics and the Origin of Species, by recognizing the diversity of modern organisms, and the striking disconti­nuities within this plethora of form, as the central problem of evolutionary biology — at a time when most colleagues would surely have cited modes of continuous transformation, or mechanisms for changes in gene frequencies, within single populations instead. (Despite this unconventionality in subject and level of focus, Dobzhansky opted for a traditional selectionist explana­tion by titling the first subsection of his book: “diversity and adaptedness.”)

As a wise and wonderful human being, and as a humanist at heart, Dob­zhansky began his book with a generous perspective on the meaning and im­portance of organic diversity. The opening paragraph (1951, p. 3) reads: “Man has always been fascinated by the great diversity of organisms which live in the world around him. Many attempts have been made to understand the meaning of this diversity and the causes that bring it about. To many minds this problem possesses an irresistible aesthetic appeal. Inasmuch as sci­entific inquiry is a form of aesthetic endeavor, biology owes its existence in part to this appeal.”

After stating the key issue, Dobzhansky then cites the discontinuities within this diversity as the crucial phenomenon demanding explanation. But he begins this second subsection, entitled “discontinuity,” by unconsciously showing his Darwinian commitments in citing organisms as the “prime real­ity” of biology (whereas, in a hierarchical reformulation of Darwinian theory, several evolutionary levels feature other biological individuals just as interest­ing, and just as well constituted — with Dobzhansky's beloved species, the quanta of his concern for diversity, as a primary example of individuality at a higher level). Dobzhansky writes (1951, p. 4): “Although individuals [i.e., or­ganisms] limited in existence to only a short interval of time, are the prime re­ality with which a biologist is confronted, a more intimate acquaintance with the living world discloses a fact almost as striking as the diversity itself. This is the discontinuity of the variation among organisms.”

Dobzhansky then commits his conceptual error in proposing a purely selec­tionist explanation — externalist at an extreme in its appeal to environmental topography as the sole mapping function for discontinuities in organic diver­sity — for the crucial fact of dumpiness in the habitation of morphospace. I discussed this passage extensively in Chapter 7 (pp. 526–528), and will only present a summary here. Dobzhansky begins by changing the level of applica­tion for Sewall Wright's nonadaptationist model, originally devised to ex­plain why the varied demes of single species may reside upon several discon­tinuous peaks of an adaptive genetic landscape. By promoting this model to the species level (see Fig. 10-31), and regarding the inhabitants of each peak as a species instead of a deme (and then reconfiguring the peaks as adaptive optima in an ecological terrain, rather than sets of workable genetic combina­tions among demes, with only the highest peak representing an optimum position for the species), Dobzhansky converted the theoretical meaning of Wright's model from an explanation for why so many demes have not ob­tained a best possible configuration into a paean for the adaptive optimality of each element in a fauna.

In describing this promoted adaptive landscape, as presented in Figure 10-31, Dobzhansky commits his panadaptationist fallacy by attempting to ren­der the inhomogeneous occupation of morphospace as a simple one-to-one “mapping” of discontinuity upon the external “terrain” that set the selective pressures responsible for crafting all aspects of organic diversity.*

The enormous diversity of organisms may be envisaged as correlated with the immense variety of environments and of ecological niches, which exist on earth. But the variety of ecological niches is not only immense,

it is also discontinuous. One species of insect may feed on, for ex­ample, oak leaves, and another species on pine needles; an insect that would require food intermediate between oak and pine would probably starve to death. Hence, the living world is not a formless mass of ran­domly combining genes and traits, but a great array of families of related gene combinations, which are clustered on a large but finite number of adaptive peaks. Each living species may be thought of as occupying one of the available peaks in the field of gene combinations. The adaptive valleys are deserted and empty.

Furthermore, the adaptive peaks and valleys are not interspersed at random. “Adjacent” adaptive peaks are arranged in groups, which may be likened to mountain ranges in which the separate pinnacles are di­vided by relatively shallow notches. Thus, the ecological niche occupied by the species “lion” is relatively much closer to those occupied by tiger, puma, and leopard than to those occupied by wolf, coyote, and jackal. The feline adaptive peaks form a group different from the group of the canine “peaks.” But the feline, canine, ursine, musteline, and certain other groups of peaks form together the adaptive “range” of carnivores, which is separated by deep adaptive valleys from the “ranges” of ro­dents, bats, ungulates, primates, and others. In turn, these “ranges” are again members of the adaptive system of mammals, which are ecologi­cally and biologically segregated, as a group, from the adaptive systems of birds, reptiles, etc. The hierarchic nature of the biological classifica­tion reflects the objectively ascertainable discontinuity of adaptive niches, in other words the discontinuity of ways and means by which organisms that inhabit the world derive their livelihood from the environment.



But the striking discontinuities in morphospace, and their ordering into taxonomic hierarchies, surely don't, at least primarily, “reflect the objectively ascertainable discontinuity of adaptive niches” — and Dobzhansky certainly understood the unstated major reason for such inhomogeneity, even though the strict adaptationism so favored at this time had momentarily clouded his excellent judgment, thus explaining his curious omission. Cats, lions and ti­gers work admirably well, with each species displaying excellent adaptation to its immediate environment. But the set of all feline species does not clump closely together in morphospace because the summits of an underlying topog­raphy now happen to lie at such close mutual proximity in an external world “out there.” Felines form a tight cluster because they share, by historical con­straints of ordinary genealogy, a large set of distinctive traits, unique to them alone by virtue of “propinquity of descent,” to cite Darwin's own description of the phenomenon — although each of these traits probably arose for good and conventional adaptationist reasons in a common ancestor. And the larger gap between felines and canines also records, as its primary raison d'etre, a greater separation in history, not the architecture of spacing between two groups of peaks in the current mountain range of worldly ecology.

Sometimes we need the press of new data to inspire the recollection of old truths. I do not doubt that many discontinuities in morphospace represent the colonization by optimal phenotypes of widely dispersed peaks in maximal biomechanical efficiency. But I am equally confident that more of nature's evi­dently nonrandom, and oddly dispersed, clusters in morphospace, bearing such enormously different weights ranging from single “outliers” to millions of species, primarily record the historical constraints imposed by workable solutions with adaptive origins — developmental designs that then congealed, enforcing reiteration and change within their internally directed channels for­ever after. Five, for all I know, may be optimal for the radial symmetry of echinoderms, and therefore predictable for any phylum in their domain. But can we argue that the sixfold way of a much, much larger clump marks an optimal and inevitable number for walking, and that elytra represent the only possible design for joint excellence in flight and protection? God, as one of our most celebrated colleagues famously exclaimed, must have an inordinate fondness for these particular creatures if he allowed one design among so many conceivable alternatives to congeal so hard, and then to iterate so often, in nature's wondrous interplay of constraint and adaptation.
