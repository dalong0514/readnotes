## 0101Defining and Revising the Structure of Evolutionary Theory

### 1.1 Theories Need Both Essences and Histories

理论需要本质与历史并重

In a famous passage added to later editions of the Origin of Species, Charles Darwin (1872, p. 134) generalized his opening statement on the apparent ab­surdity of evolving a complex eye through a long series of gradual steps by re­minding his readers that they should always treat "obvious" truths with skepticism. In so doing, Darwin also challenged the celebrated definition of science as "organized common sense," as championed by his dear friend Thomas Henry Huxley. Darwin wrote: "When it was first said that the sun stood still and world turned round, the common sense of mankind declared the doctrine false; but the old saying of Vox populi, vox Dei [the voice of the people is the voice of God], as every philosopher knows, cannot be trusted in science."

在《物种起源》的后续版本中，有一段广为人知的补充内容。在这段文字中，Charles Darwin（1872，p. 134）延伸了他在开篇提出的观点 —— 通过一系列渐进步骤进化出复杂的眼球这一想法看似荒谬。他提醒读者们应该始终对「显而易见」的真理保持怀疑态度。通过这样的论述，Darwin 也对他挚友 Thomas Henry Huxley 所推崇的「科学是经过系统化的常识」这一著名定义提出了质疑。Darwin 写道：「当人们最初提出太阳不动而地球运转的观点时，人类的常识认定这种说法是错误的；但正如每位哲学家都明白的那样，那句古老的拉丁谚语 'Vox populi，vox Dei'（意为'民众的声音即上帝的声音'）在科学领域中是不能轻信的。」

Despite his firm residence within England's higher social classes, Darwin took a fully egalitarian approach towards sources of expertise, knowing full well that the most dependable data on behavior and breeding of domesticated and cultivated organisms would be obtained from active farmers and hus­bandmen, not from lords of their manors or authors of theoretical treatises. As Ghiselin (1969) so cogently stated, Darwin maintained an uncompromis­ingly "aristocratic" set of values towards judgment of his work — that is, he cared not a whit for the outpourings of vox populi, but fretted endlessly and fearfully about the opinions of a very few key people blessed with the rare mix of intelligence, zeal, and attentive practice that we call expertise (a demo­cratic human property, respecting only the requisite mental skills and emo­tional toughness, and bearing no intrinsic correlation to class, profession or any other fortuity of social circumstance).

虽然 Darwin 在英国上层社会拥有稳固的地位，但在寻求专业知识方面，他采取了完全平等的态度。他深知，要获取关于驯养动物和栽培植物的行为与繁殖的最可靠数据，应该向实干的农民和牧场主学习，而不是去请教庄园主或理论著作的作者。正如 Ghiselin（1969）一针见中地指出，Darwin 在评判其工作时保持着一种特殊的「精英标准」—— 他完全不在意公众的议论纷纷，却对少数几位关键人物的意见忧心忡忡。这些人具备了智慧、热情和专注实践的罕见组合，也就是我们所说的专业素养。这种专业素养是一种民主的特质，它只看重必需的思维能力和心理承受力，与一个人的社会阶级、职业或其他社会地位没有任何必然联系。

Darwin ranked Hugh Falconer, the Scottish surgeon, paleontologist, and Indian tea grower, within this most discriminating of all his social groups, a panel that included Hooker, Huxley and Lyell as the most prominent mem­bers. Thus, when Falconer wrote his important 1863 paper on American fos­sil elephants (see Chapter 9, pages 745–749, for full discussion of this inci­dent), Darwin flooded himself with anticipatory fear, but then rejoiced in his critic's generally favorable reception of evolution, as embodied in the closing sentence of Falconer's key section: "Darwin has, beyond all his cotemporaries [sic], given an impulse to the philosophical investigation of the most back­ward and obscure branch of the Biological Sciences of his day; he has laid the foundations of a great edifice; but he need not be surprised if, in the progress of erection, the superstructure is altered by his successors, like the Duomo of Milan, from the roman to a different style of architecture."

Darwin 将苏格兰外科医生、古生物学家和印度茶叶种植者 Hugh Falconer 纳入了他最严格筛选的社交圈层，这个圈子包括了如 Hooker、Huxley 和 Lyell 等最杰出的成员。当 Falconer 在 1863 年发表了关于美洲化石象的重要论文时（详见第 9 章，第 745-749 页的完整讨论），Darwin 内心不免忐忑不安。但当他读到 Falconer 在关键章节的结尾处对进化论表达的认可时，顿时释然。Falconer 写道：「在同时代人中（原文为 cotemporaries），Darwin 为他那个时代最不发达且深奥的生物科学分支带来了前所未有的哲学探索动力；他奠定了一座伟大建筑的根基。如果在后续建造过程中，他的继承者们像改造米兰大教堂一样，将上层建筑从罗马风格改为另一种风格，这也是情理之中的事。」

In a letter to Falconer on October 1, 1862 (in F. Darwin, 1903, volume 1, p. 206), Darwin explicitly addressed this passage in Falconer's text. (Darwin had received an advance copy of the manuscript, along with Falconer's re­quest for review and criticism — hence Darwin's reply, in 1862, to a text not printed until the following year): "To return to your concluding sentence: far from being surprised, I look at it as absolutely certain that very much in the Origin will be proved rubbish; but I expect and hope that the framework will stand."

在 1862 年 10 月 1 日，Darwin 给 Falconer 写了一封信（此信收录于 F. Darwin 1903 年出版的著作第 1 卷，第 206 页），明确回应了 Falconer 文章中的这段内容。(由于 Falconer 事先将手稿寄给 Darwin 请求审阅和评论，Darwin 得以在 1862 年就对这篇次年才出版的文章做出回应)：「关于你的结论部分：我一点也不感到意外，我完全确信《物种起源》中的许多观点将被证明是错误的；但我期待并希望其基本理论框架将经得起考验。」

The statement that God (or the Devil, in some versions) dwells in the de­tails must rank among the most widely cited intellectual witticisms of our time. As with many clever epigrams that spark the reaction "I wish I'd said that!", attribution of authorship tends to drift towards appropriate famous sources. (Virtually any nifty evolutionary saying eventually migrates to Т. Н. Huxley, just as vernacular commentary about modern America moves to­wards Mr. Berra.) The apostle of modernism in architecture, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, may, or may not, have said that "God dwells in the details," but the plethora of tiny and subtle choices that distinguish the elegance of his great buildings from the utter drabness of superficially similar glass boxes throughout the world surely validates his candidacy for an optimal linkage of word and deed.

「上帝（在某些版本中是魔鬼）存在于细节之中」这句话，无疑是当今时代最广为流传的智慧格言之一。就像许多令人拍案叫绝、不禁感叹「这话要是我说的就好了！」的妙语一样，人们总是倾向于将其归功于某些著名人物。（事实上，任何关于进化论的精妙言论最终都会被归于 T. H. Huxley，就像描述现代美国的民间俗语最终都会被归于 Mr. Berra。）现代主义建筑的先驱 Ludwig Mies van der Rohe 是否真的说过「上帝存在于细节之中」已无从考证，但那些令他的伟大建筑作品与世界各地表面相似却毫无特色的玻璃盒子建筑区分开来的种种精妙设计细节，无疑印证了他最适合与这句名言相关联。

Architecture may assert a more concrete claim, but nothing beats the extraordinary subtlety of language as a medium for expressing the importance of apparently trivial details. The architectural metaphors of Milan's cathe­dral, used by both Falconer and Darwin, may strike us as effectively identical at first read. Falconer says that the foundations will persist as Darwin's leg­acy, but that the superstructure will probably be reconstructed in a quite dif­ferent style. Darwin responds by acknowledging Falconer's conjecture that the theory of natural selection will undergo substantial change; indeed, in his characteristically diffident way, Darwin even professes himself "absolutely certain" that much of the Origin's content will be exposed as "rubbish." But he then states not only a hope, but also an expectation, that the "framework" will stand.

建筑也许能够提出更具体的主张，但在表达那些看似微不足道的细节的重要性时，没有什么能比得上语言这一媒介所具有的精妙表达力。Falconer 和 Darwin 都曾用米兰大教堂作为建筑隐喻，这两种比喻表面上看似完全相同。Falconer 认为，作为 Darwin 的学术遗产，其理论基础将会永存，但上层架构可能会以完全不同的方式重建。对此，Darwin 承认了 Falconer 关于自然选择理论将发生重大变化的推测；事实上，以其一贯谦逊的态度，Darwin 甚至表示「完全确信」《物种起源》中的许多内容最终将被证明是「谬误」。但紧接着他又表示，他不仅希望，而且相信其理论的「基本框架」将会屹立不倒。

We might easily read this correspondence too casually as a polite dialogue between friends, airing a few unimportant disagreements amidst a commit­ment to mutual support. But I think that this exchange between Falconer and Darwin includes a far more "edgy" quality beneath its diplomacy. Consider the different predictions that flow from the disparate metaphors chosen by each author for the Duomo of Milan — Falconer's "foundation" vs. Darwin's "framework." After all, a foundation is an invisible system of support, sunk into the ground, and intended as protection against sinking or toppling of the overlying public structure. A framework, on the other hand, defines the basic form and outline of the public structure itself. Thus, the two men conjure up very different pictures in their crystal balls. Falconer expects that the underly­ing evolutionary principle of descent with modification will persist as a fac­tual foundation for forthcoming theories devised to explain the genealogical tree of life. Darwin counters that the theory of natural selection will persist as a basic explanation of evolution, — even though many details, and even some subsidiary generalities, cited within the Origin will later be rejected as false, or even illogical.

我们很容易将这些书信往来过于轻率地理解为朋友间的礼貌对话，仿佛只是在相互支持的基调下流露出一些无关紧要的分歧。但我认为，在 Falconer 和 Darwin 这次交流的礼貌措辞之下，其实暗含着更为「尖锐」的特质。让我们来思考一下两位作者为米兰大教堂选择的不同比喻所暗示的不同预测 —— Falconer 用了「基础」，而 Darwin 则用了「框架」。毕竟，基础是一个隐藏的支撑系统，它被埋在地下，目的是防止上层建筑下沉或倾倒。而框架则不同，它定义了建筑本身的基本形式和轮廓。因此，这两位学者对未来的展望大不相同。Falconer 认为，通过变异进行遗传的进化原理将会作为一个基本事实，继续为未来解释生命谱系树的理论提供基础。而 Darwin 则反驳说，尽管《物种起源》中提到的许多细节，甚至一些次要的概括性内容日后可能被证明是错误的或不合逻辑的，但自然选择理论作为解释进化的基本原理将会持续存在。








I stress this distinction, so verbally and disarmingly trivial at a first and superficial skim through Falconer's and Darwin's words, but so incisive and portentous as contrasting predictions about the history of evolutionary the­ory, because my own position — closer to Falconer than to Darwin, but in ac­cord with Darwin on one key point — led me to write this book, while also supplying the organizing principle for the "one long argument" of its entirety. I do believe that the Darwinian framework, and not just the foundation, per­sists in the emerging structure of a more adequate evolutionary theory. But I also hold, with Falconer, that substantial changes, introduced during the last half of the 20th century, have built a structure so expanded beyond the origi­nal Darwinian core, and so enlarged by new principles of macroevolutionary explanation, that the full exposition, while remaining within the domain of Darwinian logic, must be construed as basically different from the canonical theory of natural selection, rather than simply extended.

我之所以特别强调这种差异，是因为当人们初次粗略地阅读 Falconer 和 Darwin 的著作时，这种差异看似只是文字表述上的细微区别，令人容易忽视，但实际上这代表了对进化论发展历史截然不同的预测，意义深远。我的观点 —— 更倾向于 Falconer 而不是 Darwin，但在一个关键问题上与 Darwin 保持一致 —— 这不仅促成了本书的写作，也为贯穿全书的论述提供了核心思路。我确实认为，在发展出更完善的进化理论的过程中，Darwin 的理论框架（不仅仅是其基础）依然发挥着作用。但同时，我也赞同 Falconer 的观点：20 世纪后半叶引入的重大变革，通过引入新的宏观进化解释原则，已经将理论体系扩展得远超出了 Darwin 最初的核心内容。因此，尽管这一完整的理论体系仍然遵循 Darwin 的逻辑，但它应该被视为一个根本不同的理论体系，而不是简单地对经典自然选择理论的延伸。

A closer study of the material basis for Falconer and Darwin's metaphors — the Duomo (or Cathedral) of Milan — might help to clarify this important distinction. As with so many buildings of such size, expense, and centrality (both geographically and spiritually), the construction of the Duomo occupied sev­eral centuries and included an amalgam of radically changing styles and pur­poses. Construction began at the chevet, or eastern end, of the cathedral in the late 14th century. The tall windows of the chevet, with their glorious flamboyant tracery, strike me as the finest achievement of the entire structure, and as the greatest artistic expression of this highly ornamented latest Gothic style. (The term "flamboyant" literally refers to the flame-shaped element so extensively used in the tracery, but the word then came to mean "richly deco­rated" and "showy," initially as an apt description of the overall style, but then extended to the more general meaning used today.)

要理解 Falconer 和 Darwin 的这个隐喻，我们不妨深入研究一下他们用作比喻的实例 —— 米兰大教堂。这座教堂和其他许多宏伟的建筑一样，不仅规模庞大、耗资巨大，而且在地理位置和精神地位上都极其重要。它的建造横跨数个世纪，在这漫长的过程中融入了不同时期的建筑风格和设计理念。建造工程始于 14 世纪末，首先从教堂的后殿（也就是东端）开始。在我看来，后殿那些高耸的窗户上精美的火焰式（flamboyant）石雕装饰，是整座建筑最出色的部分，也是这种晚期哥特式华丽装饰风格最卓越的艺术体现。（「火焰式」这个术语最初是用来形容石雕装饰中常见的火焰形状图案，后来逐渐引申为「富丽堂皇」和「华丽」的代名词，这种含义一直延续到今天。）

Coming now to the main point, construction then slowed considerably, and the main western facade and entrance way (Fig. 1-1) dates from the late 16th century, when stylistic preferences had changed drastically from the points, curves and traceries of Gothic to the orthogonal, low-angled or gently rounded lintels and pediments of classical Baroque preferences. Thus, the first two tiers of the main (western) entrance to the Duomo display a style that, in one sense, could not be more formally discordant with Gothic elements of de­sign, but that somehow became integrated into an interesting coherence. (The third tier of the western facade, built much later, returned to a "retro" Gothic style, thus suggesting a metaphorical reversal of phylogenetic conventions, as up leads to older — in style if not in actual time of emplacement!) Finally, in a distinctive and controversial icing upon the entire structure (Fig. 1-2), the "wedding cake," or row-upon-row of Gothic pinnacles festooning the tops of all walls and arches with their purely ornamental forms, did not crown the edifice until the beginning of the 19th century, when Napoleon conquered the city and ordered their construction to complete the Duomo after so many centuries of work. (These pinnacle forests may amuse or disgust architectural purists, but no one can deny their unintended role in making the Duomo so uniquely and immediately recognizable as the icon of the city.)

谈到关键之处，建筑施工在这一时期明显放缓。主要的西立面和入口通道（图 1-1）建于 16 世纪末，当时的建筑风格偏好已经发生了巨大转变：从哥特式的尖顶、曲线和花格纹样，转向了巴洛克古典风格推崇的垂直平行、低斜度或柔和圆润的门楣和山形墙。因此，大教堂主要（西面）入口的前两层展现出的风格，从形式上看与哥特式设计元素格格不入，但却奇妙地融合成了一个和谐的整体。（西立面的第三层修建得更晚，反而回归到了「复古」哥特式风格，这种在空间上越往上反而呈现出更古老风格的设计 —— 尽管实际建造时间并非如此 —— 形成了一种有趣的历史反转！）最后，作为整个建筑结构独特而争议性的收尾之作（图 1-2），那些被形容为「婚礼蛋糕」般层层叠叠的装饰 —— 由一排排纯装饰性的哥特式尖顶环绕在所有墙壁和拱门的顶部 —— 直到 19 世纪初才最终完工。这是在拿破仑征服该城市后，遵照其命令完成的最后建设，终结了这座大教堂数个世纪的营建历程。（这些密集的尖顶装饰也许会让建筑纯粹主义者觉得滑稽或反感，但不可否认的是，正是这些装饰无意中使大教堂成为了该城市最具标志性且独一无二的象征建筑。）

How, then, shall we state the most appropriate contrast between the Duomo of Milan and the building of evolutionary theory since Darwin's Ori­gin in 1859? If we grant continuity to the intellectual edifice (as implied by comparison with a discrete building that continually grew but did not change its location or basic function), then how shall we conceive "the structure of evolutionary theory" (chosen, in large measure, as the title for this book be­cause I wanted to address, at least in practical terms, this central question in the history and content of science)? Shall we accept Darwin's triumphalist stance and hold that the framework remains basically fixed, with all visually substantial change analogous to the non-structural, and literally superficial, icing of topmost pinnacles? Or shall we embrace Falconer's richer and more critical, but still fully positive, concept of a structure that has changed in radical ways by incorporating entirely different styles into crucial parts of the building (even the front entrance!), while still managing to integrate all the differences into a coherent and functional whole, encompassing more and more territory in its continuing enlargement?

那么，我们应该如何比较米兰大教堂与自达尔文 1859 年发表《物种起源》以来进化论理论发展之间的关系呢？如果我们承认这座理论大厦具有连续性（就像一座不断扩建但位置和基本功能始终未变的建筑一样），那么我们应该如何理解「进化论的结构」呢？(之所以选择这个作为本书的标题，很大程度上是因为我希望至少从实践角度来探讨这个科学史和科学内容中的核心问题）。

我们是应该认同达尔文那种胜利者的观点，认为理论的基本框架保持不变，所有显著的变化都只是类似于装饰性的、表面性的尖顶装饰？还是应该接受 Falconer 那种更丰富、更具批判性，但同样积极的观点？后者认为，这个理论结构通过在关键部分（甚至包括正门！）融入完全不同的风格而发生了根本性的改变，但同时又成功地将这些差异整合成了一个连贯且实用的整体，并在不断扩展中涵盖了越来越广阔的领域。

Darwin's version remains Gothic, and basically unchanged beyond the vi­sual equivalent of lip service. Falconer's version retains the Gothic base as a positive constraint and director, but then branches out into novel forms that mesh with the base but convert the growing structure into a new entity, largely defined by the outlines of its history. (Note that no one has suggested the third alternative, often the fate of cathedrals — destruction, either total or, partial, followed by a new building of contrary or oppositional form, erected over a different foundation.)

Darwin 的版本仍保持着哥特式风格，除了一些表面的视觉变化外基本维持原状。而 Falconer 的版本虽然将哥特式基础作为有益的框架和指引，但在此基础上发展出了新的形态。这些新形态与原有基础自然融合，最终形成了一个全新的建筑实体，其特征主要体现在历史演变的轮廓中。(值得注意的是，没有人提出第三种可能性，尽管这常常是大教堂的最终命运 —— 即完全或部分拆毁后，在另一处地基上重建一座风格迥异的新建筑。)

In order to enter such a discourse about "the structure of evolutionary the­ory" at all, we must accept the validity, or at least the intellectual coherence and potential definability, of some key postulates and assumptions that are often not spelled out at all (especially by scientists supposedly engaged in the work), and are, moreover, not always granted this form of intelligibility by philosophers and social critics who do engage such questions explicitly. Most importantly, I must be able to describe a construct like "evolutionary theory" as a genuine "thing" — an entity with discrete boundaries and a definable his­tory — especially if I want to "cash out," as more than a confusingly poetic image, an analogy to the indubitable bricks and mortar of a cathedral.

要开始探讨「进化理论的结构」这个话题，我们必须先认可一些关键前提和假设的有效性，或者至少承认它们在逻辑上是连贯的，且可以被明确定义。这些前提和假设往往没有被明确说明（特别是那些实际从事相关研究的科学家们），而且，即使是那些专门研究这些问题的哲学家和社会评论家，也并不总是认同这些概念的可理解性。更重要的是，我必须能够将「进化理论」描述为一个确实存在的「实体」—— 一个具有清晰边界和明确历史脉络的概念体系。这样做的目的是让它不再只是一个模糊的比喻，而是能够真实地与大教堂的实体砖石建筑相对应。

In particular, and to formulate the general problem in terms of the specific example needed to justify the existence of this book, can "Darwinism" or "Darwinian theory" be treated as an entity with defining properties of "ana­tomical form" that permit us to specify a beginning and, most crucially for the analysis I wish to pursue, to judge the subsequent history of Darwinism with enough rigor to evaluate successes, failures and, especially, the degree and character of alterations? This book asserts, as its key premise and one long argument, that such an understanding of modern evolutionary theory places the subject in a particularly "happy" intellectual status — with the cen­tral core of Darwinian logic sufficiently intact to maintain continuity as the centerpiece of the entire field, but with enough important changes (to all ma­jor branches extending from this core) to alter the structure of evolutionary theory into something truly different by expansion, addition, and redefini­tion. In short, "The structure of evolutionary theory" combines enough sta­bility for coherence with enough change to keep any keen mind in a perpetual mode of search and challenge.

具体来说，为了通过一个特定例子来阐述普遍性问题，并证明本书存在的必要性，我们需要思考：是否可以将「达尔文主义」或「达尔文理论」视为一个具有『解剖学形态』特征的实体？这些特征不仅能让我们确定其起源，更重要的是（就我想要进行的分析而言），能让我们以足够的严谨度来评判达尔文主义的历史发展，包括其成功、失败，尤其是其演变的程度和特征。

本书通过一个完整的论述提出了这样一个核心观点：现代进化论已经达到了一个特别理想的理论状态 —— 达尔文主义的核心逻辑保持完整，继续作为整个领域的中心；同时，从这个核心延伸出的所有主要分支都经历了重要的变革，通过拓展、补充和重新定义，使进化论的理论框架呈现出全新的面貌。简言之，《进化论的结构》既保持了理论的连贯性，又包含了充分的创新，这种特质足以激发人们持续不断的探究与思考。

The distinction between Falconer's and Darwin's predictions, a key ingredi­ent in my analysis, rests upon our ability to define the central features of Darwinism (its autapomorphies, if you will), so that we may then discern whether the extent of alteration in our modern understanding of evolutionary mechanisms and causes remains within the central logic of this Darwinian foundation, or has now changed so profoundly that, by any fair criterion in vernacular understanding of language, or by any more formal account of de­parture from original premises, our current explanatory theory must be described as a different kind of mental "thing." How, in short, can such an in­tellectual entity be defined? And what degree of change can be tolerated or accommodated within the structure of such an entity before we must alter the name and declare the entity invalid or overthrown? Or do such questions just represent a fool's errand from the start, because intellectual positions can't be reified into sufficient equivalents of buildings or organisms to bear the weight of such an inquiry?

在我的分析中，Falconer 和 Darwin 的预测之间存在着重要区别。要理解这个区别，我们首先需要能够明确达尔文主义的核心特征（也就是它独特的特征）。只有这样，我们才能判断：我们现代对进化机制和原因的理解，是仍然符合达尔文理论的核心逻辑，还是已经发生了根本性的改变？如果是后者，无论是从普通人对语言的理解角度，还是从更专业的理论演变角度来看，我们现在的解释性理论就应该被视为一种全新的思维方式了。

这就引出了几个关键问题：我们该如何定义这样一种理论体系？在不得不改变其名称并宣布其失效之前，这样的理论体系可以发生多大程度的变化？或者，这些问题本身从一开始就是无意义的，因为理论观点毕竟不像建筑物或生物那样是具体的实体，无法用同样的方式来衡量其变化？

As arrogant as I may be in general, I am not sufficiently doltish or vainglorious to imagine that I can meaningfully address the deep philosophical ques­tions embedded within this general inquiry of our intellectual ages — that is, fruitful modes of analysis for the history of human thought. I shall therefore take refuge in an escape route that has traditionally been granted to scien­tists: the liberty to act as a practical philistine. Instead of suggesting a princi­pled and general solution, I shall ask whether I can specify an operational way to define "Darwinism" (and other intellectual entities) in a manner spe­cific enough to win shared agreement and understanding among readers, but broad enough to avoid the doctrinal quarrels about membership and alle­giance that always seem to arise when we define intellectual commitments as pledges of fealty to lists of dogmata (not to mention initiation rites, secret handshakes and membership cards — in short, the intellectual paraphernalia that led Karl Marx to make his famous comment to a French journalist: "je ne suis pas marxiste").

虽然我平时可能显得很傲慢，但我还没有自大到认为自己能够真正解答这个时代知识探索中的深层哲学问题 —— 即如何有效地分析人类思想的历史。因此，我打算采用科学家们传统上常用的一种逃避方式：以一个实践主义者的身份自由探索。

我不打算提出一个原则性的通用解决方案，而是想探讨能否找到一种实用的方式来定义「达尔文主义」（以及其他知识体系）。这种定义需要足够具体，以便能获得读者的普遍认可和理解，同时又要足够宽泛，以避免在讨论派系归属和忠诚度时陷入教条之争。这种争议在我们把知识信仰等同于对一系列教条宣誓效忠时总是会出现（更不用说那些入会仪式、秘密握手和会员卡等等形式主义的东西了 —— 正是这些东西促使 Karl Marx 对一位法国记者说出了那句著名的话："je ne suis pas marxiste"【我不是马克思主义者】）。

As a working proposal, and as so often in this book (and in human affairs in general), a "Goldilocks solution" embodies the blessedly practical kind of approach that permits contentious and self-serving human beings (God love us) to break intellectual bread together in pursuit of common goals rather than personal triumph. (For this reason, I have always preferred, as guides to human action, messy hypothetical imperatives like the Golden Rule, based on negotiation, compromise and general respect, to the Kantian categorical im­peratives of absolute righteousness, in whose name we so often murder and maim until we decide that we had followed the wrong instantiation of the right generality.) We must, in short and in this case, steer between the "too lit­tle" of refusing to grant any kind of "essence," or hard anatomy of defining concepts, to a theory like Darwinism; and the "too much" of an identification so burdened with a long checklist of exigent criteria that we will either spend all our time debating the status of particular items (and never addressing the heart or central meaning of the theory), or we will waste our efforts, and poi­son our communities, with arguments about credentials and anathemata, ap­plied to individual applicants for membership.

作为一个可行的方案，正如本书中经常提到的（也是人类事务中的普遍现象），「中庸之道」（Goldilocks solution）体现了一种难能可贵的实用方法，让我们这些爱争论又自私的人类（愿上帝保佑我们）能够搁置个人得失，为了共同目标坐下来理性交流。(正因如此，在指导人类行为方面，我一直更倾向于像黄金法则这样基于协商、妥协和互相尊重的灵活原则，而非康德式的绝对命令（Categorical Imperative）。因为人们常常打着后者的旗号大开杀戮，直到发现自己其实是在用错误的方式践行某个正确的普世原则。）简而言之，在这种情况下，我们必须在两个极端之间寻找平衡：一方面要避免「过少」，即不能拒绝给达尔文主义这样的理论赋予任何形式的「本质」或核心概念框架；另一方面也要防止「过多」，即不能用过于繁琐的标准清单来定义理论。否则我们要么会把所有时间都浪费在争论具体标准的地位上（而永远无法触及理论的核心含义），要么会陷入无休止的资格认证争论之中，这不仅徒劳无功，还会损害群体的和谐。

In his brilliant attempt to write a "living" history and philosophy of science about the contemporary restructuring of taxonomic theory by phenetic and cladistic approaches, Hull (1988) presents the most cogent argument I have ever read for "too little" on Goldilocks's continuum, as embodied in his de­fense of theories as "conceptual lineages" (1988, pp. 15-18). I enthusiasti­cally support Hull's decision to treat theories as "things," or individuals in the crucial sense of coherent historical entities — and in opposition to the standard tactic, in conventional scholarship on the "history of ideas," of tracing the chronology of expression for entirely abstract concepts defined only by formal similarity of content, and not at all by ties of historical continuity, or even of mutual awareness among defenders across centuries and varied cul­tures. (For example, Hull points out that such a conventional history of the "chain of being" would treat this notion as an invariant and disembodied Platonic archetype, independently "borrowed" from the eternal storehouse of potential models for natural reality, and then altered by scholars to fit local contexts across millennia and cultures.)

在 Hull（1988）试图编写一部动态展现当代分类学理论演变的科学史和科学哲学著作时，他提出了一个极具说服力的论点，这个论点涉及到金发姑娘（Goldilocks）故事中「太少」的比喻，具体体现在他对「理论发展脉络」（conceptual lineages）的论述中（1988，pp. 15-18）。我完全赞同 Hull 将理论视为具体「实体」或独立个体的观点，也就是将其视为具有连贯性的历史存在。这与传统「思想史」研究中的标准做法形成鲜明对比：传统研究往往仅仅根据内容的表面相似性来追溯抽象概念在不同时期的表现形式，而完全忽视了历史的连续性，甚至不关注跨越世纪和文化的不同学者之间是否存在相互影响。(比如，正如 Hull 所指出的，这种传统史学会将「存在之链」（chain of being）这一概念视为一个永恒不变的、脱离实体的柏拉图式理想模型，仿佛它是从某个永恒的理念宝库中反复「借用」出来，然后被不同时代和文化中的学者按照各自的需求加以改造。)

But I believe that Hull's laudable desire to recast the history of ideas as a narrative of entities in historical continuity, rather than as a disconnected chronology of tidbits admitted into a class only by sufficient formal similarity with an abstract ideological archetype, then leads him to an undervaluation of actual content. Hull exemplifies his basic approach (1988, p. 17): "A con­sistent application of what Mayr has termed 'population thinking' requires that species be treated as lineages, spatiotemporally localized particulars, in­dividuals. Hence, if conceptual change is to be viewed from an evolutionary perspective, concepts must be treated in the same way. In order to count as the 'same concept,' two term-tokens must be part of the same conceptual lin­eage. Population thinking must be applied to thinking itself."

但是我认为，Hull 试图将思想史重新诠释为一个具有历史连续性的实体发展过程，而不是仅仅将那些与抽象意识形态模型有相似之处的片段罗列成互不相关的编年史，这种值得赞赏的努力反而让他低估了实际内容的重要性。Hull 在解释其基本方法时举例说道（1988，p. 17)：「要想始终如一地运用 Mayr 提出的'种群思维'（population thinking），就必须将物种视为一种延续在时间和空间中的特定个体谱系。因此，如果我们要从进化的视角来研究概念的变迁，也必须用相同的方式来处理概念。要判断两个概念表达是否属于'同一个概念'，关键在于它们是否属于同一个概念发展谱系。这种种群思维的方法必须延伸到思维研究本身。」

So far, so good. But Hull now extends this good argument for the necessity of historical connectivity into a claim for sufficiency as well — thus springing a logical trap that leads him to debase, or even to ignore, the "morphology" (or idea content) of these conceptual lineages. He states that he wishes to "organize term-tokens into lineages, not into classes of similar term-types" (pp. 16-17). I can accept the necessity of such historical continuity, but nei­ther I nor most scholars (including practicing scientists) will then follow Hull in his explicit and active rejection of similarity in content as an equally neces­sary criterion for continuing to apply the same name — Darwinian theory, for example — to a conceptual lineage.

这个论述到这里是合理的。然而，Hull 随后将历史连通性的必要性论点进一步延伸为充分性论点 —— 这让他陷入了一个逻辑困境，导致他轻视甚至忽视了这些概念传承中的「形态学特征」（即思想内容）。他明确表示，他想要「将概念标记（term-tokens）组织成传承谱系，而不是将其归类为相似概念类型（term-types）的集合」（第 16-17 页）。虽然我认同这种历史连续性的必要性，但我和大多数学者（包括在职科学家）都不会赞同 Hull 的观点 —— 他明确且主动地否定了内容相似性作为延续使用同一概念名称（如达尔文理论）的必要条件。

At an extreme that generates a reductio ad absurdum for rejecting Hull's conclusion, but that Hull bravely owns as a logical entailment of his own prior decision, a pure criterion of continuity, imbued with no constraint of content, forces one to apply the same name to any conceptual lineage that has remained consciously intact and genealogically unbroken through several generations (of passage from teachers to students, for example), even if the current "morphology" of concepts directly inverts and contradicts the central arguments of the original theory. "A proposition can evolve into its contra­dictory," Hull allows (1988, p. 18). Thus, on this account, if the living intel­lectual descendants of Darwin, as defined by an unbroken chain of teaching, now believed that each species had been independently created within six days of 24 hours, this theory of biological order would legitimately bear the name of "Darwinism." And I guess that I may call myself kosher, even though I and all members of my household, by conscious choice and with great ideo­logical fervor, eat cheeseburgers for lunch every day — because we made this dietary decision in a macromutational shift of content, but with no genealogi­cal break in continuity, from ten previous generations of strict observers of kashrut.

让我们来看一个极端的例子，这个例子能证明 Hull 的结论是荒谬的，不过 Hull 还是勇敢地承认这是他之前观点必然带来的逻辑结果。如果我们采用一个纯粹基于连续性的标准，而不考虑内容的约束，那么只要某个理念的传承保持连续且有意识地未被中断（比如通过师生之间的传授），即使现在的理论内容完全颠倒甚至与原始理论相悖，我们也必须为其保留相同的名称。正如 Hull 所说（1988，p. 18)：「一个理论是可以演变成与其完全对立的观点的。」按照这种说法，如果 Darwin 的学术传人（通过不间断的教学相传）现在认为所有物种都是在六天之内被分别创造的（每天 24 小时），这种生物学理论仍然可以合法地被称为「达尔文主义」。按照同样的逻辑，我似乎也可以称自己是遵守犹太教规的，尽管我和我的全家人都是有意识地、带着强烈的理念选择每天中午吃芝士汉堡 —— 因为虽然这在内容上是一个巨大的改变，但从谱系上看，这与我们前十代严格遵守犹太饮食法规（kashrut）的传统仍保持着连续性。

The objections that most of us would raise to Hull's interesting proposition include both intellectual and moral components. Certain kinds of systems are, and should be, defined purely by genealogy and not at all by content. I am my father's son no matter how we interact. But such genealogical defini­tions, as validated by historical continuity, simply cannot adequately charac­terize a broad range of human groupings properly designated by similarity in content. When Cain mocked God's inquiry about Abel's whereabouts by ex­claiming "Am I my brother's keeper" (Genesis 4:9), he illustrated the appro­priateness of either genealogy by historical connection or fealty by moral re­sponsibility as the proper criterion for "brotherhood" in different kinds of categories. Cain could not deny his genealogical status as brother in one sense, but he derided a conceptual meaning, generally accorded higher moral worth as a consequence of choice rather than necessity of birth, in disclaim­ing any responsibility as keeper. As a sign that we have generally privileged the conceptual meaning, and that Cain's story still haunts us, we need only re­member Claudius's lament that his murder of his own brother (and Hamlet's father) "hath the primal eldest curse upon't."

对于 Hull 提出的这个引人深思的观点，我们大多数人会从知识和道德两个层面提出质疑。有些系统确实应该且只能通过血缘关系来定义，而非通过其内容。比如说，不管我和父亲的关系如何，我永远都是他的儿子，这一点无可改变。但是，仅仅依靠这种建立在历史延续性基础上的血缘定义，显然无法充分描述那些应该依据内容相似性来划分的广泛人类群体。

当该隐对上帝询问亚伯下落时，讥讽地回答说：「我岂是我兄弟的看守人吗？」（创世记 4:9），他生动地展示了「兄弟关系」这个概念在不同语境下可以有两种判定标准：一种是基于历史联系的血缘关系，另一种则是基于道德责任的忠诚关系。该隐无法否认自己在血缘上确实是亚伯的兄弟，但他否认了自己作为看护者的责任，藐视了「兄弟」这个概念更深层的含义 —— 这种基于选择而非与生俱来的含义，往往被赋予更高的道德价值。要证明我们普遍更重视这种概念层面的含义，以及该隐的故事至今仍在困扰着我们，只需想起克劳狄斯在谋杀自己的兄弟（也就是哈姆雷特的父亲）后的哀叹：「这桩凶行背负着最原始、最古老的诅咒。」

Ordinary language, elementary logic, and a general sense of fairness all combine to favor such preeminence for a strong component of conceptual continuity in maintaining a name or label for a theory. Thus, if I wish to call myself a Darwinian in any just or generally accepted sense of such a claim, I do not qualify merely by documenting my residence within an unbroken lin­eage of teachers and students who have transmitted a set of changing ideas organized around a common core, and who have continued to study, aug­ment and improve the theory that bears such a longstanding and honorable label. I must also understand the content of this label myself, and I must agree with a set of basic precepts defining the broad ideas of a view of natural real­ity that I have freely chosen to embrace as my own. In calling myself a Dar­winian I accept these minimal obligations (from which I remain always and entirely free to extract myself should my opinions or judgments change); but I do not become a Darwinian by the mere default of accidental location within a familial or educational lineage.

日常用语、基本逻辑和一般的公平感都表明，在延续一个理论的名称或标签时，保持核心概念的连续性非常重要。因此，如果我想要合理且恰当地称自己为达尔文主义者，仅仅证明我属于一个传承不断的师生群体是远远不够的。即使这个群体一直在传递着一些不断演变的思想，并持续研究、丰富和完善这个历史悠久且备受尊重的理论，这也是不够的。我必须真正理解这个标签所代表的内涵，同时认同一系列基本原则 —— 这些原则定义了我主动选择接受的自然界观。当我称自己为达尔文主义者时，我就是在接受这些基本责任（当然，如果我的观点或判断发生改变，我随时可以选择放弃这些责任）。但是，仅仅因为我恰好处在某个学术或传承体系中，并不能自动使我成为达尔文主义者。

Thus, if we agree that a purely historical, entirely content-free definition of allegiance to a theory represents "too little" commitment to qualify, and that we must buttress any genealogical criterion with a formal, logical, or anatom­ical definition framed in terms of a theory's intellectual content, then what kind or level of agreement shall we require as a criterion of allegiance for in­clusion? We now must face the opposite side of Goldilocks's dilemma — for once we advocate criteria of content, we do not wish to impose such strin­gency and uniformity that membership becomes more like a sworn obedience to an unchanging religious creed than a freely chosen decision based on per­sonal judgment and perception of intellectual merits. My allegiance to Darwinian theory, and my willingness to call myself a Darwinian biologist, must not depend on my subscription to all 95 articles that Martin Luther nailed to the Wittenburg church door in 1517; or to all 80 items in the Syllabus of Er­rors that Pio Nono (Pope Pius IX) proclaimed in 1864, including the "fal­lacy," so definitionally uncongenial to science, that "the Roman Pontiff can and should reconcile himself to and agree with progress, liberalism and mod­ern civilization"; or to all 39 articles of the Church of England, adopted by Queen Elizabeth in 1571 as a replacement for Archbishop Thomas Cranmer's 42 articles of 1553.

因此，如果我们认为，仅仅基于历史渊源、完全不考虑内容的理论归属定义代表着「过于宽松」的标准而不能被接受，那么我们就必须在理论的知识内容方面建立形式化、逻辑性或结构性的定义来支撑这种归属关系。那么，作为接纳标准，我们应该要求怎样的认同程度呢？这就让我们面临了一个「过犹不及」的两难处境 —— 因为一旦我们开始强调内容标准，我们也不希望规定过于严格和统一，使得成员资格变得像是对某种一成不变的宗教信条宣示效忠，而不是基于个人判断和对学术价值的理解所作出的自由选择。我对达尔文理论的认同，以及我愿意自称为达尔文主义生物学家，不应该建立在我必须完全接受像马丁·路德在 1517 年钉在维滕堡教堂门上的 95 条论纲那样的规条之上；也不应该像要认同教皇庇护九世在 1864 年颁布的《谬误全书》中的 80 条条款那样，其中包括了一条与科学精神格格不入的「谬误」，即「罗马教皇可以且应该与进步、自由主义和现代文明达成和解与认同」；更不应该像要遵守英国国教会的 39 条信条那样，这些信条是伊丽莎白女王在 1571 年采用的，用来替代托马斯·克兰默大主教 1553 年制定的 42 条信条。

Goldilocks's "just right" position between these extremes will strike nearly all cooperatively minded intellectuals, committed to the operationality and advance of their disciplines, as eminently sensible: shared content, not only historical continuity, must define the structure of a scientific theory; but this shared content should be expressed as a minimal list of the few defining at­tributes of the theory's central logic — in other words, only the absolutely es­sential statements, absent which the theory would either collapse into fallacy or operate so differently that the mechanism would have to be granted an­other name.

在这些极端观点之间，存在一个「恰到好处」的中间立场（就像童话故事《金发女孩》中不冷不热的粥一样）。对于几乎所有致力于推动学科发展的学者来说，这个立场都显得极其合理。这个立场认为：科学理论的结构不能仅仅依靠历史的延续性来定义，更要依靠其核心内容；但这些核心内容应该被精简为理论核心逻辑中最基本的几个特征 —— 也就是说，只保留那些最根本的原则。如果缺少了这些原则，要么整个理论会变得毫无意义，要么其运作方式会发生如此大的变化，以至于我们不得不给它一个全新的名称。

Now such a minimal list of such maximal centrality and importance bears a description in ordinary language — but its proper designation requires that evolutionary biologists utter a word rigorously expunged from our profes­sional consciousness since day one of our preparatory course work: the con­cept that dare not speak its name — essence, essence, essence (say the word a few times out loud until the fear evaporates and the laughter recedes). It's high time that we repressed our aversion to this good and honorable word. Theories have essences. (So, by the way, and in a more restrictive and nuanced sense, do organisms — in their limitation and channeling by con­straints of structure and history, expressed as Bauplane of higher taxa. My critique of the second theme of Darwinian central logic, Chapters 4–5 and 10–11, will treat this subject in depth. Moreover, my partial defense of or­ganic essences, expressed as support for structuralist versions of evolutionary causality as potential partners with the more conventional Darwinian functionalism that understandably denies intelligibility to any notion of an es­sence, also underlies the double entendre of this book's title, which honors the intellectual structure of evolutionary theory within Darwinian traditions and their alternatives, and which also urges support for a limited version of structuralist theory, in opposition to certain strict Darwinian verities.)

这个极其重要且核心的简明概念清单，本可以用普通语言来描述 —— 但要给它一个恰当的定义，进化生物学家们就必须说出一个词，这个词从我们开始预备课程的第一天起就被刻意地从专业意识中清除出去：那个避讳提及的概念 —— 本质（essence），本质，本质（不妨把这个词大声说几遍，直到不再感到恐惧，也不再想笑）。现在是时候摆脱我们对这个优秀而庄重的词的抵触了。理论是具有本质特征的。(顺便说一句，从更严格和细微的角度来看，生物体也是如此 —— 它们受到结构和历史的制约与引导，体现在高等分类群的基本体制（Bauplane）中。我将在第 4-5 章和第 10-11 章深入探讨这一主题，批评达尔文中心理论的第二个要点。此外，我部分支持有机体具有本质特征的观点，认为结构主义的进化因果关系可以作为传统达尔文功能主义的潜在补充。传统达尔文主义当然会否认任何本质概念的合理性，这种张力也反映在本书标题的双重含义中：一方面，它表达了对达尔文传统及其替代理论中进化理论知识架构的敬意；另一方面，它也支持一种有限的结构主义理论，以此对抗某些严格的达尔文教条。）

Our unthinking rejection of essences can be muted, or even reversed into propensity for a sympathetic hearing, when we understand that an invocation of this word need not call down the full apparatus of an entirely abstract and eternal Platonic eidos — a reading of "essence" admittedly outside the logic of evolutionary theory, and historical modes of analysis in general. But the solu­tion to a meaningful notion of essence in biology lies within an important epi­sode in the history of emerging evolutionary views, a subject treated exten­sively in Chapter 4 of this book, with Goethe, Etienne Geoffroy St. Hilaire, and Richard Owen as chief protagonists.

当我们意识到提到「本质」这个词并不一定要完全套用柏拉图式的抽象永恒理念（eidos）时，我们对本质的盲目排斥态度就可能会有所缓和，甚至可能转而愿意以开放的心态来重新审视它。虽然这种对「本质」的传统理解确实不符合进化论的逻辑，也不符合一般的历史分析方法。但在生物学领域中，我们可以找到一个更有意义的本质概念。这个答案就藏在进化理论发展史上的一个重要时期，本书第四章对此进行了详细探讨，其中重点介绍了三位重要人物：Goethe、Etienne Geoffroy St. Hilaire 和 Richard Owen。

After all, the notion of a general anatomical blueprint that contains all particular incarnations by acting as a fundamental building block (Goethe's leaf or Geoffroy's vertebra) moved long ago from conceptualization as a disem­bodied and nonmaterial archetype employed by a creator, to an actual struc­ture (or inherited developmental pathway) present in a flesh and blood ances­tor — a material basis for channeling, often in highly positive Ways, the future history of diversity within particular phyletic lineages. This switch from ar­chetype to ancestor permitted us to reformulate the idea of "essence" as broad and fruitful commonalities that unite a set of particulars into the most meaningful relationships of common causal structure and genesis. Our active use of this good word should not be hampered by a shyness and disquietude lacking any validity beyond the vestiges of suspicions originally set by battles won so long ago that no one can remember the original reasons for anathe­matization. Gracious (and confident) victors should always seek to revive the valid and important aspects of defeated but honorable systems. And the tran­scendental morphologists did understand the importance of designating a small but overarching set of defining architectural properties as legitimate es­sences of systems, both anatomical and conceptual.

关于生物基本构造的认识已经发生了重大转变。以往人们认为存在一种通用的解剖蓝图（如歌德提出的叶子原型或杰弗罗伊提出的脊椎原型），作为所有具体形态的基本构建单元。这种认识已经从早期认为是创造者使用的非物质原型模板，转变为真实存在于具有血肉之躯的祖先体内的实体结构（或遗传发育途径）。这种物质基础很大程度上积极地引导着特定进化支系中生物多样性的未来发展方向。

从「原型」到「祖先」的这一概念转变，让我们得以重新思考「本质」的含义。现在我们将其理解为一种广泛而有意义的共性，它能将各种特征通过共同的因果关系和起源联系起来。我们不应该因为一些历史遗留的偏见而对使用「本质」这个很好的词感到犹豫不安，况且那些导致人们反对使用这个词的历史争议早已尘埃落定，以至于现在已经没有人记得最初排斥这个词的原因。作为优雅而自信的胜利者，我们应该致力于从那些失败但值得尊重的理论体系中吸收有价值的精华。超验形态学家们确实认识到了一个重要观点：无论是在解剖结构还是在概念体系中，将少数具有统领性的结构特征认定为系统的合法本质都是非常重要的。

Hull correctly defines theories as historical entities, properly subject to all the principles of narrative explanation — and I shall so treat Darwinian logic and its substantial improvements and changes throughout this book. But the­ories of range and power also feature inherent "essences," implicit in their logical structure, and operationally definable as minimal sets of proposi­tions so crucial to the basic function of a system that their falsification must undermine the entire structure, and also so necessary as an ensemble of mutual implication that all essential components must work in concert to set the theory's mechanism into smooth operation as a generator and explana­tion of nature's order. In staking out this middle Goldilockean ground be­tween (1) the "too little" of Hull's genealogical continuity without commit­ment to a shared content of intellectual morphology and (2) the "too much" of long lists of ideological fealty, superficially imbibed or memorized, and then invoked to define membership in ossified cults rather than thoughtful al­legiance to developing theories, I will argue that a Darwinian essence can be minimally (and properly) defined by three central principles constituting a tri­pod of necessary support, and specifying the fundamental meaning of a pow­erful system that Darwin famously described as the "grandeur in this view of life."

Hull 正确地将理论视为历史发展的产物，认为它们应该遵循叙事解释的所有原则 —— 在本书中，我也将用这种方式来讨论达尔文理论及其重要进展和变化。然而，那些具有广泛影响力的理论也都包含着其逻辑结构中的「本质特征」。从实际操作的角度来看，这些本质特征可以被定义为一组最基本的命题：它们对理论的基本功能极其重要，一旦被证明是错误的，整个理论体系就会崩塌；同时，这些命题作为一个相互关联的整体，必须协同运作，才能让理论顺利发挥作用，生成和解释自然界的规律。

在寻找恰当的理论定义方式时，我试图在两个极端之间找到平衡：一方面是 Hull 的观点过于简单，仅仅强调理论发展的历史连续性，而忽视了思想内容的共同特征；另一方面是过于复杂的做法，即制定冗长的意识形态清单，这些清单往往被人们肤浅地接受或死记硬背，其作用更多是划分教条式团体的界限，而非体现对理论发展的深入理解。我将论证达尔文理论的本质可以（也应该）简明地用三个核心原则来定义，这三个原则构成了必要的支撑体系，阐明了达尔文所说的「生命观之宏大」这一强大理论体系的根本含义。

I shall then show that this formulation of Darwinian minimal commit­ments proves its mettle on the most vital ground of maximal utility. For not only do these three commitments build, in their ensemble, the full frame of a comprehensive evolutionary worldview, but they have also defined the chief objections and alternatives motivating all the most interesting debate within evolutionary theory during its initial codification in the 19th century. More­over, and continuing in our own time, these three themes continue to specify the major weaknesses, the places in need of expansion or shoring up, and the locus of unresolved issues that make evolutionary biology such a central and exciting subject within the ever changing and ever expanding world of mod­ern science.

我将论证达尔文主义的这些基本原则在最重要的实用性层面上展现了其真正价值。这三个基本原则不仅共同构成了一个完整的进化论世界观框架，而且它们还概括了 19 世纪进化论形成初期各种最精彩的学术争论中的主要质疑和替代理论。更重要的是，一直到今天，这三个核心主题依然指向了进化生物学中的主要短板、亟需拓展或加强的领域，以及尚未解决的问题。正是这些特点使得进化生物学在这个不断发展、持续扩张的现代科学世界中，始终保持着其核心地位和永恒的魅力。

### 1.2 The Structure of Evolutionary Theory: Revising the Three Central Features of Darwinian Logic

进化论的结构：修正达尔文逻辑的三个核心特征

In the opening sentence of the Origin's final chapter (1859, p. 459), Darwin famously wrote that "this whole volume is one long argument." The pres­ent book, on "the structure of evolutionary theory," despite its extravagant length, is also a brief for an explicit interpretation that may be portrayed as a single extended argument. Although I feel that our best current formulation of evolutionary theory includes modes of reasoning and a set of mechanisms substantially at variance with strict Darwinian natural selection, the logical structure of the Darwinian foundation remains remarkably intact — a fasci­nating historical observation in itself, and a stunning tribute to the intel­lectual power of our profession's founder. Thus, and not only to indulge my personal propensities for historical analysis, I believe that the best way to ex­emplify our modern understanding lies in an extensive analysis of Darwin's basic logical commitments, the reasons for his choices, and the subsequent manner in which these aspects of "the structure of evolutionary theory" have established and motivated all our major debates and substantial changes since Darwin's original publication in 1859.1 regard such analysis not as an antiquarian indulgence, but as an optimal path to proper understanding of our current commitments, and the underlying reasons for our decisions about them.

在《物种起源》最后一章的开篇（1859，p. 459），达尔文写下了这句著名的话：「这整本书构成了一个完整的论证。」本书虽然篇幅浩繁，讨论「进化论的结构」，但同样也是为一个明确的观点所做的论证，可以被视为一个连贯的长篇论述。虽然我认为我们当前对进化论的最佳理解包含了一些推理方式和机制，它们与严格的达尔文自然选择理论有着实质性的差异，但达尔文理论的逻辑框架仍然保持着令人惊叹的完整性 —— 这本身就是一个引人深思的历史现象，也是对我们这个学科创始人非凡智慧的最好证明。因此，我认为要展示我们现代的理解，最好的方式就是对达尔文的基本逻辑前提进行深入分析，包括他做出这些选择的原因，以及这些「进化论结构」的各个方面如何在达尔文 1859 年首次出版著作以来，形成和推动了我们所有重要的争论和实质性变革。我认为，这种分析并非是一种纯粹的历史考据，而是理解我们当前立场的最佳途径，也有助于我们理解这些选择背后的根本原因。

As a primary theme for this one long argument, I claim that an "essence" of Darwinian logic can be defined by the practical strategy defended in the first section of this chapter: by specifying a set of minimal commitments, or broad statements so essential to the central logic of the enterprise that disproof of any item will effectively destroy the theory, whereas a substantial change to any item will convert the theory into something still recognizable as within the Bauplan of descent from its forebear, but as something sufficiently differ­ent to identify, if I may use the obvious taxonomic metaphor, as a new subclade within the monophyletic group. Using this premise, the long argu­ment of this book then proceeds according to three sequential claims that set the structure and order of my subsequent chapters:

作为这篇论证的核心主题，我认为达尔文理论的「本质」可以通过本章第一节提出的实用策略来定义：即确定一系列最基本的原则，或者一些对理论核心至关重要的基本陈述。这些陈述如此重要，以至于其中任何一项被推翻都会导致整个理论的崩塌。同时，对任何一项的重大修改都会使理论发生转变 —— 虽然这种转变后的理论仍能在其祖先的发展蓝图（Bauplan）中被辨认出来，但如果用分类学的说法来比喻的话，它已足以被归类为单系类群（monophyletic group）中的一个新分支（subclade）。基于这个前提，本书的论证将按照三个连续的论点展开，这些论点也决定了后续章节的结构和顺序：

1 Darwin himself formulated his central argument under these three basic premises. He understood their necessity within his system, and the difficulty that he would experience in convincing his contemporaries about such unfa­miliar and radical notions. He therefore presented careful and explicit de­fenses of all three propositions in the Origin. I devote the first substantive chapter (number 2) to an exegesis of the Origin of Species as an embodiment of Darwin's defense for this central logic.

Darwin 将自己的核心论点建立在这三个基本前提之上。他深知这些前提在其理论体系中的重要性，也清楚地意识到要让当时的人们接受这些陌生而激进的观点会面临诸多挑战。因此，他在《物种起源》一书中小心谨慎地对这三个命题做出了明确的论证。在本书的第一个主体章节（第 2 章）中，我将通过解析《物种起源》来展示 Darwin 是如何为这一核心逻辑进行辩护的。

2 As evolutionary theory experienced its growing pains and pursued its founding arguments in the late 19th and early 20th centuries (and also in its pre-Darwinian struggles with more inchoate formulations before 1859), these three principles of central logic defined the themes of deepest and most persistent debate — as, in a sense, they must because they constitute the most interesting intellectual questions that any theory for causes of descent with modification must address. The historical chapters of this book's first half then treat the history of evolutionary theory as responses to the three central issues of Darwinian logic (Chapters 3–7).

在 19 世纪末和 20 世纪初，进化论正处于发展的关键时期，科学家们不断完善其基本论据。在这之前的 1859 年以前，达尔文主义出现之前的科学界就已经在探索一些不够成熟的理论雏形。在这个过程中，这三个核心逻辑原则成为了最深刻且持久的争论焦点。这是必然的，因为它们代表了任何试图解释生物演化和遗传变异理论必须面对的最具挑战性的理论问题。本书的前半部分（第 3-7 章）将从这三个达尔文主义核心问题出发，梳理进化论的历史发展脉络。

3 As the strict Darwinism of the Modern Synthesis prevailed and "hard­ened," culminating in the overconfidences of the centennial celebrations of 1959, a new wave of discoveries and theoretical reformulations began to challenge aspects of the three central principles anew — thus leading to an­other fascinating round of development in basic evolutionary theory, extend­ing throughout the last three decades of the 20th century and continuing to­day. But this second round has been pursued in an entirely different and more fruitful manner than the 19th century debates. The earlier questioning of Darwin's three central principles tried to disprove natural selection by offer­ing alternative theories based on confutations of the three items of central logic. The modern versions accept the validity of the central logic as a foun­dation, and introduce their critiques as helpful auxiliaries or additions that enrich, or substantially alter, the original Darwinian formulation, but that leave the kernel of natural selection intact. Thus, the modern reformula­tions are helpful rather than destructive. For this reason, I regard our modern understanding of evolutionary theory as closer to Falconer's metaphor, than to Darwin's, for the Duomo of Milan — a structure with a firm foundation and a fascinatingly different superstructure. (Chapters 8–12, the second half of this book on modern developments in evolutionary theory, treat this third theme.)

当现代综合理论中的严格达尔文主义思想日渐盛行并逐渐形成固定模式时，这种趋势在 1959 年的百年庆典上达到了顶峰，人们对此充满了过度自信。然而与此同时，一波新的发现和理论重构开始重新挑战其核心原则 —— 这引发了进化理论基础研究新一轮令人着迷的发展历程，这种发展贯穿了 20 世纪最后三十年，并一直持续到今天。

这一轮的研究讨论采用了与 19 世纪完全不同且更具建设性的方式。19 世纪时期，人们质疑达尔文的核心原则，试图通过反驳其基本逻辑来否定自然选择理论，并提出替代性理论。而现代的研究则接受了这些核心逻辑作为基础，将新的见解作为有益的补充和拓展引入进来。这些新观点虽然丰富甚至实质性地改变了达尔文最初的理论表述，但依然保持了自然选择这一核心概念的完整性。因此，现代的理论重构是具有建设性而非破坏性的。

正因如此，我认为我们对进化理论的现代理解更接近 Falconer 而非达尔文对米兰大教堂（Duomo）的比喻 —— 这是一个拥有坚实地基，却有着引人入胜的独特上层建筑的结构。(本书后半部分的第 8-12 章着重讨论了这些进化理论的现代发展。)

Thus, one might say, this book cycles through the three central themes of Darwinian logic at three scales — by brief mention of a framework in this chapter, by full exegesis of Darwin's presentation in Chapter 2, and by lengthy analysis of the major differences and effects in historical (Part 1) and modern critiques (Part 2) of these three themes in the rest of the volume.

因此，可以说，本书从三个不同层面展开了对达尔文理论三大核心主题的探讨：首先在本章中简要介绍理论框架，接着在第二章中详细解读达尔文的原始论述，最后在书的其余部分中，通过第一部分的历史视角和第二部分的现代观点，深入分析了这三个主题在不同时期的重要争议及其影响。

The basic formulation, or bare-bones mechanics, of natural selection is a disarmingly simple argument, based on three undeniable facts (overproduc­tion of offspring, variation, and heritability)1 and one syllogistic inference (natural selection, or the claim that organisms enjoying differential reproduc­tive success will, on average, be those variants that are fortuitously better adapted to changing local environments, and that these variants will then pass their favored traits to offspring by inheritance). As Huxley famously, and ruefully, remarked (in self-reproach for failing to devise the theory him­self), this argument must be deemed elementary (and had often been formulated before, but in negative contexts, and with no appreciation of its power — see p. 137), and can only specify the guts of the operating machine, not the three principles that established the range and power of Darwin's rev­olution in human thought. Rather, these three larger principles, in defining the Darwinian essence, take the guts of the machine, and declare its simple operation sufficient to generate the entire history of life in a philosophical manner that could not have been more contrary to all previous, and cher­ished, assumptions of Western life and science.

自然选择的基本理论，或者说其最基本的运作机制，是一个出乎意料地简单的论证。这个论证建立在三个无可争议的事实之上（后代的过度繁殖、变异和遗传性），以及一个三段论推理（即自然选择：那些在繁殖上更为成功的生物，通常是那些恰好能够更好地适应当地环境变化的变异个体，这些个体随后会通过遗传将其优势特征传给后代）。正如 Huxley 在自责未能亲自发现这一理论时所发出的著名感叹，这个论证本质上是如此基础（尽管这个论证此前也曾多次被人提出，但都只是被用作否定性的例子，且未能认识到其重要性 —— 见第 137 页）。然而这个论证仅仅揭示了这个机制的核心原理，而未能完整展现达尔文在人类思想革命中那三个关键原则的范围和力量。相反，这三个更深层的原则在定义达尔文主义的本质时，采用了这个核心机制，并表明这种简单的运作原理足以用一种哲学方式解释生命的整个演化历史。这种解释方式，却与西方长期以来所珍视的生活和科学假设完全背道而驰。

The three principles that elevated natural selection from the guts of a working machine to a radical explanation of the mechanism of life's history can best be exemplified under the general categories of agency, efficacy, and scope. I treat them in this specific order because the logic of Darwin's own de­velopment so proceeds (as I shall illustrate in Chapter 2), for the most radical claim comes first, with assertions of complete power and full range of appli­cability then following.

自然选择理论从一个简单的运行机制发展成为解释生命演化历史的革命性理论，这一过程中起决定性作用的三个原则，可以用能动性（agency）、有效性（efficacy）和作用范围（scope）这三个基本范畴来概括。我之所以按照这个特定顺序来讨论这些原则，是因为这正是达尔文理论发展的内在逻辑（我将在第二章详细说明)：首先提出最具革新性的观点，随后才论证这一理论的强大作用力及其广泛的适用范围。

Agency. The abstract mechanism requires a locus of action in a hierar­chical world, and Darwin insisted that the apparently intentional "benevo­lence" of nature (as embodied in the good design of organisms and the har­mony of ecosystems) flowed entirely as side-consequences of this single causal locus, the most "reductionistic" account available to the biology of Darwin's time. Darwin insisted upon a virtually exceptionless, single-level theory, with organisms acting as the locus of selection, and all "higher" order emerging, by the analog of Adam Smith's invisible hand, from the (unconscious) "strug­gles" of organisms for their own personal advantages as expressed in dif­ferential reproductive success. One can hardly imagine a more radical refor­mulation of a domain that had unhesitatingly been viewed as the primary manifestation for action of higher power in nature — and Darwin's brave and single-minded insistence on the exclusivity of the organismic level, although rarely appreciated by his contemporaries, ranks as the most radical and most distinctive feature of his theory.

能动性。在这个分层的自然界中，抽象机制需要一个具体的作用主体。达尔文坚持认为，自然界表面上看起来的「仁慈」（体现在生物体的精妙设计和生态系统的和谐运作中），其实完全是这个单一因果作用点的附带结果。这是达尔文时代生物学能给出的最「还原主义」的解释。

达尔文提出了一个几乎没有任何例外的单一层次理论。在这个理论中，生物个体是自然选择的主体，而所有「更高」层次的秩序都是通过一种类似经济学家亚当·斯密所说的「看不见的手」的机制产生的 —— 即生物个体在追求自身利益时的（无意识）「竞争」，这种竞争最终体现为繁殖成功率的差异。这种理论重构之激进令人惊叹，要知道在此之前，这个领域一直被毫不怀疑地视为更高力量在自然界运作的主要证据。达尔文勇敢而坚定地主张只关注生物个体这一层面，尽管这一观点很少得到当时其他学者的认可，但这恰恰构成了他理论中最激进也最具特色的要素。

Efficacy. Any reasonably honest and intelligent biologist could easily understand that Darwin had identified a vera causa (or true cause) in natural selection. Thus, the debate in his time (and, to some extent, in ours as well) never centered upon the existence of natural selection as a genuine causal force in nature. Virtually all anti-Darwinian biologists accepted the reality and action of natural selection, but branded Darwin's force as a minor and negative mechanism, capable only of the headsman's or executioner's role of removing the unfit, once the fit had arisen by some other route, as yet uniden­tified. This other route, they believed, would provide the centerpiece of a "real" evolutionary theory, capable of explaining the origin of novelties. Dar­win insisted that his admittedly weak and negative force of natural selection could, nonetheless, under certain assumptions (later proved valid) about the nature of variation, act as the positive mechanism of evolutionary novelty — that is, could "create the fit" as well as eliminate the unfit — by slowly accu­mulating the positive effects of favorable variations through innumerable generations.

有效性。任何一位诚实且有见识的生物学家都能清楚地理解，Darwin 在自然选择理论中找到了一个真实的因果关系（vera causa，拉丁语，意为「真实原因」）。因此，无论是在他的年代还是在现今，科学界的争论重点从来就不是自然选择是否真实存在于自然界中。即便是那些反对达尔文理论的生物学家也承认自然选择确实存在并发挥作用，但他们认为这种作用微不足道且消极被动，只能充当「淘汰者」的角色 —— 也就是说，只能在生物已经通过某种未知途径获得适应性特征后，清除那些不适应的个体。这些学者认为，真正能解释生物新特征起源的「真正」进化理论，其核心应该是那个未知的途径。然而，Darwin 始终坚持，尽管自然选择的作用看似微弱且消极，但在特定条件下（这些关于生物变异特性的假设后来被证实是正确的），它不仅能够淘汰不适应的个体，还能够通过世代积累有利变异的方式，逐步「塑造」出适应环境的生物。这样，自然选择就成为了推动进化创新的积极力量。

Scope. Even the most favorably minded of contemporaries often admit­ted that Darwin had developed a theory capable of building up small changes (of an admittedly and locally "positive" nature as adaptations to changing environments) within a "basic type" — the equivalent, for example, of making dogs from wolves or developing edible corn from teosinte. But these critics could not grasp how such a genuine microevolutionary process could be ex­tended to produce the full panoply of taxonomic diversity and apparent "progress" in complexification of morphology through geological time. Dar­win insisted on full sufficiency in extrapolation, arguing that his micro-evolutionary mechanism, extended through the immensity of geological time, would be fully capable of generating the entire pageant of life's history, both in anatomical complexity and taxonomic diversity — and that no further causal principles would be required.

在研究范围上，即使是达尔文那个时代最支持他的科学家们也往往承认，达尔文的理论确实能够解释「基本物种类型」内的微小变化（这些变化确实是对环境改变的局部性「积极」适应）—— 比如说，将狼驯化成狗，或者把野生蒿草（teosinte）培育成我们今天食用的玉米。但这些评论者无法理解，这种确实存在的微进化（microevolution）过程如何能够延伸扩展，最终产生如此丰富的物种分类多样性，以及在漫长地质时期中生物形态逐渐复杂化的表面「进步」现象。对此，达尔文坚持认为他的理论具有完整的解释力，他主张仅靠微进化机制，在浩瀚的地质时间尺度上运作，就完全足以解释生命历史的整个演化过程，包括解剖结构的复杂化和物种分类的多样化 —— 无需引入任何其他的因果解释原理。

Because primates are visual animals, complex arguments are best portrayed or epitomized in pictorial form. The search for an optimal icon to play such a role is therefore no trivial matter (although scholars rarely grant this issue the serious attention so richly merited) — especially since the dangers of confu­sion, misplaced metaphor, and replacement of rigor with misleading "intu­ition" stand so high. I knew from the beginning of this work that I needed a suitable image for conveying the central logic of Darwinian theory. As one of my humanistic conceits, I hoped to find a historically important scientific im­age, drawn for a different reason, that might fortuitously capture the argu­ment in pictorial form. But I had no expectation of success, and assumed that I would need to commission an expressly designed figure drawn to a long list of specifications.

作为依赖视觉的生物，灵长类在理解复杂论述时最适合通过图像形式来展示和概括。因此，寻找一个理想的示意图来实现这个目的绝非小事（尽管学者们很少给予这个问题应有的重视）—— 这一点尤为重要，因为我们随时可能陷入混乱、使用不恰当的比喻，或是用貌似直观但具有误导性的「直觉」取代严谨的推理。在开始这项研究时，我就意识到需要找到一个合适的图像来阐述达尔文理论的核心逻辑。出于我的学术构想，我希望能找到一幅具有历史意义的科学图像，虽然它最初是为其他目的而创作的，但或许能巧妙地以图像方式展现我的论点。然而，我并不指望一定能成功，并做好了需要专门委托创作一幅符合详细规范的图像的准备。

The specific form of the image — its central metaphorical content, if you will — plays an important role in channeling or misdirecting our thoughts, and therefore also requires careful consideration. In the text of this book, I speak most often of a "tripod" since central Darwinian logic embodies three major propositions that I have always visualized as supports — perhaps be­cause I have never been utterly confident about this entire project, and I needed some pictorial encouragement to keep me going for twenty years. (And I much prefer tripods, which can hold up elegant objects, to buttresses, which may fly as they preserve great Gothic buildings, but which more often shore up crumbling edifices. Moreover, the image of a tripod suits my major claim particularly well — for I have argued, just above, that we should define the "essence" of a theory by an absolutely minimal set of truly necessary propositions. No structure, either of human building or of abstract form, captures this principle better than a tripod, based on its absolute minimum of three points for fully stable support in the dimensional world of our physical experience.)

图像的具体形式 —— 也就是其核心的隐喻含义 —— 在引导或误导我们思维的过程中起着重要作用，因此需要我们认真思考。在本书中，我经常使用「三脚架」这个意象，因为达尔文主义的核心逻辑包含三个主要命题，我一直将它们想象成支柱 —— 这可能是因为我始终对这整个研究项目没有完全的把握，需要这样的形象化类比来激励自己坚持二十年。（我更偏爱三脚架而非扶壁，虽然扶壁在支撑宏伟的哥特式建筑时可以呈现出优美的飞扶状，但它们更多时候是用来支撑摇摇欲坠的建筑。而且，三脚架这个意象特别契合我的核心论点 —— 我在上文中已经论证过，我们应该用最精简的必要命题集合来定义理论的「本质」。在我们生活的三维物理世界中，没有任何结构，无论是实体建筑还是抽象概念，能比三脚架更好地诠释这一原则，因为它恰恰需要最少的三个支点就能获得完全的稳定支撑。）

But organic images have always appealed more strongly, and I preferred a biological icon. If the minimal logic can be represented by a tripod pointing downward, then the same topology can be inverted into a structure growing upward. Darwin's own favorite image of the tree of life immediately sug­gested itself, and I long assumed that I would eventually settle on a botanical icon. But I also remembered Darwin's first choice for an organic metaphor or picture of branching to capture his developing views about descent with modification and the causes of life's diversity — the "coral of life" of his "B Note­book" on transmutation, kept during the 1830's as he became an evolutionist and struggled towards the theory of natural selection (see Barrett et al., 1987).

但是来自生物界的图像始终更令人着迷，我也更偏爱用生物形态作为象征符号。如果说最基本的逻辑结构可以用一个向下的三脚架来表示，那么通过简单的空间翻转，这个结构就能变成一个向上生长的形态。达尔文最钟爱的「生命之树」意象自然而然地浮现在我的脑海中，我曾长期认为自己最终会选择一个植物形态的标志。不过我也想起了达尔文最初用来展示其进化思想的另一个生物隐喻 ——「生命珊瑚」（coral of life）。这个概念出现在他 1830 年代的「B 笔记本」中，那时他正在发展其进化论思想，并逐步构建自然选择理论（参见 Barrett et al.，1987）。

As I began to write this summary chapter, I therefore aimlessly searched through images of Cnidaria from my collection of antiquarian books in paleontology. I claim no general significance whatsoever for my good fortune, but after a lifetime of failure in similar quirky quests, I was simply stunned to find a preexisting image — not altered one iota from its original form, I promise you, to suit my metaphorical purposes — that so stunningly embodied my needs, not only for a general form (an easy task), but down to the smallest de­tails of placement and potential excision of branches (the feature that I had no right or expectation to discover and then to exapt from so different an original intent).

在我开始撰写这个总结章节时，我随意浏览着我收藏的古生物学古籍中有关腔肠动物（Cnidaria）的插图。虽然这次的幸运发现并无什么特别的意义，但在经历了无数次类似的特殊搜索都以失败告终之后，我竟意外发现了一幅完美契合需求的现成图像。我可以确认，这幅图像完全保持着原貌，却奇妙地满足了我的全部要求 —— 不仅在整体形态上完全符合（这本是个容易达成的要求），甚至连分支的具体位置和可能的剪裁细节都恰到好处（这种契合程度完全出乎我的意料，因为这幅图原本是为了完全不同的目的而创作的）。

The following figure comes from the 1747 Latin version of one of the semi­nal works in the history of paleontology — the 1670 Italian treatise of the Sicilian savant and painter Agostino Scilla, ha vana speculazione disingan-nata dal senso ("Vain speculation undeceived by the senses" — Scilla's de­fense, at the outset of "the scientific revolution" of Newton's generation, for empirical methods in the study of nature, and specifically, in this treatise, for a scientific paleontology and the need to recognize fossils as remains of an­cient organisms, not as independent products of the mineral kingdom). This work, famous not only for an incisive text, but also for its beautiful plates (see Fig. 1-3), engraved by an author known primarily as an artist of substan­tial eminence, includes this figure, labeled Coralium articulatum quod copio-sissimum in rupibus et collibus Messanae reperitur ("Articulated coral, found in great abundance in the cliffs and hills of Messina").

这幅图来自一部古生物学史上具有里程碑意义的著作的 1747 年拉丁文版本。该著作最初是由西西里著名学者和画家 Agostino Scilla 于 1670 年用意大利语撰写的论文，标题为《ha vana speculazione disingan-nata dal senso》（意为「感官对空想的驳斥」）。这部作品诞生于牛顿时代科学革命的早期，Scilla 通过这部著作强调了在自然研究中采用实证方法的重要性。特别是在这篇论文中，他为科学古生物学进行辩护，指出化石是古代生物的遗迹，而不是像当时某些人认为的那样仅仅是矿物的天然产物。

这部作品不仅以其深刻的论述内容著称，更因其精美的插图（见图 1-3）而闻名。这些插图出自 Scilla 之手，他在当时更为人所知的身份是一位享有盛誉的艺术家。图中所示的这幅插图标注为 Coralium articulatum quod copiosissimum in rupibus et collibus Messanae reperitur（意为「在意大利墨西拿的悬崖和山丘中大量发现的节状珊瑚」）。

This model, and its organic features, work uncommonly well as a meta­phor for the Goldilockean position of definition by a barest minimum of truly fundamental postulates. For Scilla's coral, with its branching structure (see Fig. 1-4) — particularly as expressed in the lessening consequences of excising branches at ever higher levels nearer the top (the analogs of disconfirming theoretical features of ever more specialized and less fundamental import) — so beautifully captures the nature and operation of the intellectual structure that I defended above for specifying the essences of theories. The uncanny ap­propriateness of Scilla's coral lies in the fortuity that this particular specimen (accurately drawn from nature by Scilla, I assume, and not altered to as­sert any general point) just happens to include exactly the same number of branches (three) as my Darwinian essential structure. (They terminate at the same upper level, so I could even turn the specimen over into a tolerably unwobbly tripod!) Moreover, since this particular genus of corals grows in discrete segments, the joining points correspond ideally with my metaphor of chopping planes for excising parts of structures at various levels of impor­tance in an intellectual entity. But, most incredibly, the segmental junctions of this particular specimen just happen to occupy the exact places that I needed a priori to make my central point about lower choppings that destroy theo­ries, middle choppings that change theories in a Falconerian way (major al­terations in structure upon a preserved foundation), and upper choppings that change theories in the lesser manner of Darwin's Milanese metaphor (smaller excisions that leave the framework intact as well).

这个模型及其有机特征，作为一个通过最少的基本假设来定义的「恰到好处」位置的比喻，效果出奇地好。看看 Scilla 的珊瑚及其分支结构（见图 1-4），尤其是当我们观察到在靠近顶端处切除分支时所产生的影响会越来越小，这正好类比于那些越来越专业化且基础重要性越来越低的理论特征被否定时的情况。这种结构完美地展现了我前面所论证的关于理论本质的知识框架的特点和运作方式。

这株 Scilla 珊瑚之所以如此恰当地符合我的比喻，是源于一个偶然的巧合：这个特定的标本（我认为是 Scilla 根据自然实物精确绘制，而非为证明某个观点而修改的）恰好具有与我的达尔文主义基本结构相同的分支数量（三个）。这些分支在同样的高度终止，我甚至可以把标本倒置，变成一个相当稳定的三脚架！更有趣的是，由于这种特定属的珊瑚是以分节段的方式生长的，其节点的连接处完美地对应了我的比喻 —— 即在理论体系的不同重要层次上进行结构切分的切面。但最令人惊叹的是，这些节段的连接处恰好完美地展示了我想要阐述的核心观点：在理论演变中存在三种不同层次的「切割」。底层的切割会完全摧毁原有理论；中层的切割会以 Falconer 的方式改变理论，即在保持基础不变的前提下对结构做出重大调整；而顶层的切割则如同 Darwin 在米兰提出的比喻那样，仅仅进行小幅修改，既保持了框架的完整性，又实现了理论的改变。

1-3. The famous frontispiece from Scilla's treatise of 1670 defending the organic nature of fossils. The solid young man, representing the truth of sensory experi­ence, shows a fossil sea urchin in his right hand to a wraithlike figure represent­ing the former style of speculative thinking. With his left hand, the solid figure points to other fossils found in Sicily. The text proclaims: "Vain speculation un­deceived by the senses."

1-3. 在 Scilla 1670 年论证化石源于生物的著作中，有一幅著名的封面插图。画中，一位健硕的青年象征着感官经验带来的真理，他右手向一个虚幻的身影展示着一枚海胆化石，这个虚幻身影代表着旧时纯粹靠思辨的学术传统。这位青年的左手则指向在西西里岛发现的其他化石。插图上写着这样一句话："空谈理论终为感官所破。"

1-4. Agostino Scilla was also a celebrated painter as well as a scien­tist. The plates of his 1670 trea­tise are therefore particularly well done. This figure, representing a fossil coral that Scilla found near Messina, fortuitously (and without any alteration whatsoever), pre­sents a detailed picture of the basic logic of Darwinian theory as recog­nized in this book. See text for details.

1-4. Agostino Scilla 不仅是一位著名画家，同时也是一位科学家。正因如此，他在 1670 年发表的论文中的插图都画得极为精美。在墨西拿附近，他发现了一块化石珊瑚，并将其绘制成图。有趣的是，这幅完全没有经过任何修改的图画，恰好完整展示了达尔文理论中本书所强调的基本逻辑。具体解释请参见正文。

The central trunk (the theory of natural selection) cannot be severed, or the creature (the theory) dies. (The roots, if you will, represent sources of evi­dence; any one may be excised, if recognized as incorrect by later study, so long as enough remain to anchor the structure). This central trunk then di­vides into a limited number of major branches. These basic struts — the three branches of the Darwinian essence in this particular picture — are also so es­sential that any severing of a complete branch either kills, or so seriously compromises, the entire theory that a new name and basic structure becomes essential.

这个理论的主干（自然选择理论）就像生命体一样不能被切断，否则整个理论就会瓦解。(这个比喻中的根系就像是各种证据来源；如果后续研究证明某个证据有误，在保证整体结构稳定的前提下，可以将其移除）。从这个主干又延伸出数量有限的几个主要分支。在这个特定场景下，这三个达尔文理论核分支都至关重要 —— 如果完全切断其中任何一个分支，要么会导致整个理论的崩溃，要么会严重削弱理论的完整性，以至于我们需要为其重新命名并构建新的基本框架。

We now reach the interesting point where excisions and regraftings pre­serve the essential nature of an intellectual structure, but with two quite dif­ferent levels of change and revision, as characterized by Falconer's and Dar­win's competing metaphors for the Duomo of Milan. I would argue that a severing low on any one of the three major branches corresponds with a revi­sion profound enough to validate the more interesting Falconerian version of major revision upon a conserved foundation. (The Falconerian model is, in this sense, a Goldilockean solution itself, between the "too much" of full de­struction and the "too little" of minor cosmetic revision.) On the other hand, the severing of a subbranch of one of the three branches symbolizes a less portentous change, closer to Darwinian models for the Milanese Duomo — an alteration of important visual elements, but without change in the basic framework.

我们现在讨论一个有趣的现象：当我们对思想体系进行调整和重组时，虽然保留了其本质特征，但这种改变可以发生在两个截然不同的层次上 —— 这正如 Falconer 和 Darwin 对米兰大教堂所做的不同比喻所展示的那样。我认为，如果在三个主要分支中任何一个的底部进行改动，这种深层次的修改足以支持 Falconer 提出的那个更有趣的观点：在保持基础框架的同时进行重大革新。(从这个角度来看，Falconer 的模型本身就像童话中金发姑娘的选择一样，找到了「过犹不及」的最佳平衡点 —— 既不像完全推倒重建那样「太过激进」，也不像表面修修补补那样「太过保守」。）另一方面，如果仅仅改动三个主要分支中某一个的子分支，这种变化就相对较小，更接近 Darwin 对米兰大教堂的看法 —— 虽然改变了一些重要的视觉元素，但并未触及基本框架。

My fascination with the current state of evolutionary theory, at least as I read current developments in both logic and empirics, lies in its close con­formity to the Falconerian model — with enough continuity to make the past history of the field so informative (and so persistently, even emotionally, compelling), but with enough deep difference and intellectual fascination to stim­ulate anyone with a thirst for the intriguing mode of novelty that jars previ­ous certainty, but does not throw a field into the total anarchy of complete rebuilding (not a bad thing either, but far from the actual circumstance in this case).

从我对当前逻辑和实证研究发展的理解来看，现代进化论的发展状态令我着迷，因为它完美契合了 Falconerian 模型的特点。这个领域既保持着充分的延续性，使其历史发展显得格外有意义且始终引人入胜，又存在着足够的深层差异和令人着迷的学术特点。这些特点能够激发那些对新思想充满热情的人的兴趣。这种新颖性虽然会挑战我们既有的认知，但并不会导致整个领域需要完全重建而陷入混乱（虽然重建本身并非坏事，但这并非本例的实际情况）。







To summarize my views on the utility of such a model for the essence of Darwinian logic, I will designate three levels of potential cuts or excisions to this organic (and logical) coral of the structure of evolutionary theory, as originally formulated by Darwin in the Origin of Species, and as revised in a Falconerian way in recent decades. The most inclusive and most fundamental K-cuts (killing cuts) sever at least one of the three central principles of Dar­winian logic and thereby destroy the theory tout court. The second level of R-cuts (revision cuts) removes enough of the original form on one of the three central branches to ensure that the new (and stronger or more arborescent) branch, in regrowing from the cut, will build a theory with an intact Darwin­ian foundation, but with a general form sufficiently expanded, revised or re­constructed to present an interestingly different structure of general explana­tion — the Falconerian model for the Duomo of Milan. Finally, the third level of S-cuts (subsidiary cuts) affects only a subbranch of one of the three major branches, and therefore reformulates the general theory in interesting ways, while leaving the basic structure of explanation intact — the Darwinian model for the Duomo of Milan.

为了阐述我对这个模型在达尔文进化理论核心逻辑中的作用的看法，我将从三个层次来分析进化论理论这一结构性体系。这个理论最初由达尔文在《物种起源》中提出，并在近几十年中经过了受 Falconer 思想影响的重要修订。

第一个层次是最根本的「K-切分」（killing cuts），它会切断达尔文理论三大核心原则中的至少一个，从而从根本上动摇整个理论基础。第二个层次是「R-切分」（revision cuts），它会从三个主要理论分支中的一个上剪除相当一部分原有内容。这样做的目的是让新生长出的分支（可能更强大或更具分支性）能够在保持达尔文理论基础的同时，通过扩展、修订或重构，形成一个显著不同的理论解释框架 —— 这就像 Falconer 对米兰大教堂的重新诠释。最后一个层次是「S-切分」（subsidiary cuts），它只涉及三大主要分支之一的某个子分支，这种修改虽然会以新颖的方式重塑理论，但会完整保留基本的解释框架 —— 这更类似于达尔文对米兰大教堂的原始构想。

I wrote this book because I believe that all three pillars, branches, or tri­pod legs, representing the three fundamental principles of Darwinian central logic, have been subjected to fascinating R-cuts that have given us at least the firm outlines — for the revised structure of evolutionary explanation remains a work vigorously in progress, as only befits the nature of its subject, after all! — of a far richer and fascinatingly different theory with a retained Dar­winian core rooted in the principles of natural selection. In short, we live in the midst of a Falconerian remodeling of our growing and multiform, yet co­herently grounded, intellectual mansion.

我之所以写这本书，是因为我认识到达尔文进化论的三大核心原则 —— 可以将它们比喻为三根支柱或三个基础 —— 都经历了令人着迷的革新性突破。这些突破至少为我们勾勒出了一个全新的理论框架的轮廓。这个修订后的进化论解释体系仍在蓬勃发展中，这也正好符合其研究对象的本质特征。这个新理论虽然保留了以自然选择为核心的达尔文主义基础，却比原来更加丰富多彩，也更引人入胜。简而言之，我们正亲身经历着一场以 Falconerian 方法论为指导的知识重构过程，这个过程正在重塑我们这座日益壮大、形态多样却又基础稳固的科学殿堂。

I will not, in this chapter, detail the nature of the K-cuts that failed (thus preserving the central logic of Darwinism), the R-cuts that have succeeded in changing the structure of evolutionary theory in such interesting ways, and the S-cuts that have refurbished major rooms in particular wings of the edi­fice — for these specifications set the subject matter of all following chapters. But to provide a better opening sense of this book's argument — and to clarify the nature of the three central claims of Darwinian logic — I shall at least dis­tinguish, for each branch, the K-cuts that never prevailed (and therefore did not fell the structure) from the R-cuts that have affected each branch, and have therefore provoked our current process of building an enriched struc­ture for evolutionary theory.

在本章中，我不会详细讨论以下几种理论切入点：那些失败的 K 类切入点（K-cuts）（这些失败反而印证了达尔文主义的核心逻辑），那些成功改变了进化论理论结构的 R 类切入点（R-cuts），以及那些更新了理论体系特定领域的 S 类切入点（S-cuts）—— 因为这些具体内容将在后续章节中详细展开。不过，为了让读者更好地理解本书的论点，同时阐明达尔文主义逻辑的三个核心主张，我会至少区分说明每个分支中两种情况：一种是那些未能成功（因此未能动摇理论根基）的 K 类切入点，另一种是那些确实影响了各个分支的 R 类切入点，正是后者推动了我们目前正在进行的工作 —— 为进化论构建一个更加丰富的理论框架。

Returning to Scilla's coral (Fig. 1-4), consider the central branch as the first leg of the tripod (agency, or the claim for organismal selection as the causal locus of the basic mechanism), the left branch as the second leg (efficacy, or the claim that selection acts as the primary creative force in building evo­lutionary novelties), and the right branch as the third leg (scope, or the claim that these microevolutionary modes and processes can, by extrapola­tion through the vastness of geological time, explain the full panoply of life's changes in form and diversity).

让我们回到 Scilla 的珊瑚示意图（图 1-4）。这个图形可以类比为一个三脚支架：中央分支代表第一个支撑点，体现了「主体作用」（agency），即认为物种选择是基本进化机制的核心驱动力；左分支代表第二个支撑点，体现了「有效性」（efficacy），即自然选择是塑造进化创新的主要推动力；右分支则代表第三个支撑点，体现了「作用范围」（scope），即这些微观层面的进化模式和过程，通过漫长的地质年代积累，最终可以解释生命形态和多样性的所有演变过程。

The cut labeled K1 on Figure 1-4 would have severed the entire coral by disproving natural selection as an evolutionary force at all. The cut labeled K2 would have fully severed the second branch, leaving natural selection as a legitimate cause, but denying it any creative role, and thereby dethroning Darwinism as a major principle in explaining life's history. (We shall see, in Chapters 3–6, that such a denial of creativity underlay the most common anti-Darwinian argument in the first generations of debate.) The cut labeled К3 would have fully severed the third branch, allowing that natural selection might craft some minor changes legitimately called "creative" in a local sense, but denying that Darwin's mechanism could then be extended to explain the panoply of macroevolutionary processes, or the actual pageant of life's his­tory. The success of any one of these K-cuts would have destroyed Darwinian theory, plain and simple. None of them succeeded, and the foundation of Darwinian central logic remains intact and strong.

图 1-4 中标记为 K1 的切口试图通过完全否定自然选择作为进化动力的作用来切断整个理论体系。标记为 K2 的切口则试图切断第二个分支，虽然承认自然选择是一种合理的机制，但否认它具有任何创造性作用，这样就会让达尔文主义在解释生命历史方面失去其核心地位。（我们将在第 3-6 章看到，在早期几代的演化论争中，这种对创造性的否定正是反达尔文主义最常见的论据。）标记为 K3 的切口则试图切断第三个分支，它承认自然选择可能会在局部范围内造成一些可以称之为「创造性」的微小改变，但否认达尔文的机制能够解释宏观演化的丰富现象，或者说无法解释生命历史的盛大演进画卷。这些 K 切口中任何一个如果得逞，都会彻底摧毁达尔文理论。然而它们都未能成功，达尔文理论的核心基础至今依然完整而稳固。

In striking, and most positive, contrast, I believe that higher R-cuts — leav­ing the base of each major branch intact, but requiring a substantial regrowth and regrafting of an enlarged structure upon the retained foundation — have been successfully wielded against all three branches of Darwinian logic, as the structure of evolutionary theory developed in the last third of the 20th cen­tury (following too rigid a calcification of the original structure, a good ad­umbration of the coral metaphor!, in the hardening of the Modern Synthesis that culminated in the Darwinian centennial celebrations of 1959). On the first branch of agency, the cut labeled R1 (see Fig. 1-4) expanded Darwin's unilevel theory of organismal selection into a hierarchical model of selection acting simultaneously on several legitimate levels of Darwinian individuality (genes, cell-lineages, organisms, demes, species, and clades). I shall show in Chapters 3, 8, and 9 how the logic of this pronounced expansion builds a the­ory fascinatingly different from, and not just a smooth extension of, Darwin's single level mechanism of agency — my reason for portraying the hierarchical model as a deeply interesting R-cut rather than a more superficial S-cut.

与其他情况形成鲜明而积极的对比，我认为更高层次的理论重构（R-cuts）在达尔文理论的所有三个分支上都取得了成功。这种重构保留了每个主要分支的基础，但需要在原有基础上重新发展并构建一个更大的理论体系。这种发展出现在 20 世纪最后三十多年的演化理论研究中，此前的现代综合理论在 1959 年达尔文百年纪念活动中达到顶峰后变得过于僵化，这恰恰很像珊瑚钙化的过程！

在第一个关于选择作用机制的分支上，标记为 R1 的重构（见图 1-4）将达尔文的单一层次生物选择理论发展成为一个多层次模型。在这个新模型中，自然选择可以同时作用于多个不同的生物学层次，包括基因、细胞系、生物个体、种群、物种以及进化支系等。我将在第 3、8 和 9 章中详细说明，这种重大扩展如何建立起一个全新的理论体系，而不是简单地对达尔文单一层次机制理论的延伸。这也是为什么我将这个分层模型称为一个深远的理论重构（R-cut），而不是一个表面的修补（S-cut）的原因。

On the second branch of efficacy, the cut labeled R2 accepts the validity of Darwin's argument for creativity (by leaving the base of the branch intact), but introduces a sufficient weight of formalist thinking — via renewed appre­ciation for the enormous importance of structural, historical, and develop­mental constraint in channeling the pathways of evolution, often in highly positive ways — that the pure functionalism of a strictly Darwinian (and ex­ternalist) approach to adaptation no longer suffices to explain the channeling of phyletic directions, and the clumping and inhomogeneous population of organic morphospace. The strict Darwinian form of explanation has thereby been greatly changed and enriched, but in no way defeated. I shall discuss the historical aspect of this branch in Chapters 4 and 5, and modern reformula­tions of this R2 cut in Chapters 10 and 11.

在讨论有效性的第二个主要方向上，我们称之为 R2 的理论分界保留了达尔文关于生物创造性的基本论点，但同时引入了相当比重的形式主义思维。这种思维主要通过重新认识结构、历史和发展等制约因素在引导生物进化过程中的重要作用而体现，这些制约因素往往能产生积极的影响。因此，仅仅依靠严格的达尔文主义和外部环境决定论的纯功能主义观点，已经不足以解释生物进化方向的形成过程，以及生物形态在可能空间中的聚集和不均匀分布现象。这种观点虽然极大地改变和丰富了严格的达尔文主义解释，但并未否定其核心思想。我将在第 4 章和第 5 章探讨这一理论分支的历史背景，并在第 10 章和第 11 章讨论 R2 理论的现代诠释。

On the final branch of scope, the cut labeled R3 accepts the Darwinian contention that microevolutionary modes and principles can build grand pat­terns by cumulation through geological immensity, but rejects the argument that such extrapolations can render the entire panoply of phenomena in life's history without adding explicitly macroevolutionary modes for distinctive expression of these processes at higher tiers of time — as in the explanation of cladal trends by species sorting under punctuated equilibrium, rather than by extended adaptive anagenesis of purely organismal selection, and in the ne­cessity of titrating adaptive microevolutionary accumulation with occasional resetting of rules and patterns by catastrophically triggered mass extinctions at time's highest tier. Chapters 6 and 12 discuss historical and modern cri­tiques of Darwinian extrapolationism.

在研究范围的最后一个分支中，R3 这一类别承认达尔文的观点：微观进化机制（microevolutionary modes）和原理确实能够通过漫长的地质时期积累形成宏大的进化模式。但它反对仅仅依靠简单外推就能解释生命历史中的所有现象。相反，我们需要在更高的时间尺度上明确引入宏观进化机制。这体现在两个方面：首先，在解释进化支系的发展趋势时，应该考虑间断平衡（punctuated equilibrium）下的物种分类作用，而不是仅仅依靠生物个体选择带来的延伸适应性进化；其次，在最长的时间尺度上，需要将适应性微观进化的累积效应与由灾难性事件引发的大规模物种灭绝所导致的进化规律重置这两个过程结合起来考虑。关于达尔文主义外推理论的历史评价和现代批判，将在第 6 章和第 12 章中详细讨论。

For now, I will say little about the even higher and more superficial S-cuts of subbranches, but I will at least indicate how I construe this category by stating a hypothetical example for each branch: an S1 cut, for example, might accept the selective basis of evolutionary change in a purely mechanical sense, but then deny full force to Darwin's deliciously radical philosophical claim that all apparent "higher level" harmony arises consequentially, through the invisible hand of lower levels acting for personal reproductive success. One might, in principle, propose such a revision by arguing that a higher force, operating by an overarching principle of order, "employs" natural selection as its mechanical agent. (I speak only hypothetically here, for no such defend­able scientific hypothesis now exists, although the concept certainly remains intelligible. Explicitly theological versions don't count as science, whatever their kind or form of potential validity.) An S2 cut might be assayed by a developmental saltationist who accepted the selectionist basis of adaptive change but felt that, at a sufficient relative frequency to be counted as impor­tant, the initial steps of such changes may be larger than the pure continuationism of Darwinian selection can admit. And an S3 cut might accept the full validity of microevolutionary extrapolationism, but deny the subsidiary de­fense of progress that Darwin grafted onto this apparatus (see Chapter 6) with ecological arguments about plenitude and the priority of biotic over abiotic competition.

目前，我不会过多讨论各个分支更高层次和更表层的 S-切割，但我至少会通过为每个分支提供一个假设性的例子来说明我如何理解这个类别：

例如，S1 切割可能会从纯机械的角度接受进化变化的选择性基础，但随后会否定达尔文那个具有革命性的哲学观点的核心力量 —— 即所有表面上的「更高层次」和谐都是由追求个体繁殖成功的低层次力量（类似经济学中的「无形之手」）所产生的结果。原则上，有人可能会提出这样的修正：认为存在一种更高层次的力量，它通过某种统领性的秩序原则在运作，并「利用」自然选择作为其执行工具。（这里我只是作假设性的说明，因为目前并不存在这样可以被科学证实的假说，尽管这个概念本身是可以理解的。至于那些带有宗教神学色彩的解释，无论其具有何种形式或潜在的合理性，都不能被视为科学。）

S2 切割可能来自一位支持跳跃式进化的学者，他虽然接受适应性变化的选择论基础，但认为在相当重要的频率下，这些变化的初始步骤可能比达尔文渐进式选择理论所能接受的幅度要大得多。

而 S3 切割则可能完全接受微观进化可以推广到更大尺度的观点，但否认达尔文后来附加的进步论观点，这个观点是他通过生态学中关于生物丰富度以及生物竞争优于非生物竞争的论据来支持的（参见第 6 章）。

As a paleontologist and part-time historian of science by profession, my reading of these important R-cuts arose from a macroevolutionary perspec­tive framed largely in terms of longstanding difficulties faced by Darwinism in extending its successes for explaining small changes in palpable time into equally adequate causal accounts for broader patterns and processes in geo­logical history. I have, in this effort, also benefited from my personal study of Darwin's life and times, and especially the late 19th century debates on mech­anisms of evolution (as promulgated largely by professionals who could nei­ther fully understand nor accept the radical philosophical commitments un­derlying Darwin's view). This historical study allowed me to grasp the continuity in basic themes from Darwin's own formulation, through these foundational debates, right down to the major theoretical struggles of our own time. An appreciation of this continuity allowed me to discern and de­fine the distinctively Darwinian view of life.

作为一名专职古生物学家和业余科学史研究者，我从宏观进化（macroevolution）的角度来解读这些重要的研究断面。这种解读主要着眼于达尔文主义所面临的一个长期难题：虽然达尔文主义能够很好地解释短时间内的微小变化，但在解释地质历史中更宏观的模式和过程时却面临着困难。

在研究过程中，我得益于对达尔文其人其时的深入了解，特别是对 19 世纪末关于进化机制的争论的研究。这些争论主要来自于一些专业人士，他们既无法完全理解达尔文观点中所蕴含的革新性哲学思想，也无法完全接受这些思想。通过历史研究，我得以把握从达尔文最初的理论形成，经过这些基础性辩论，直至当代主要理论争议之间的内在联系。正是对这种思想传承的深入理解，使我能够识别并界定真正意义上的达尔文生命观。

But I recognize only too well that every strength comes paired with weaknesses. In my case, a paleontological focus leads me into relative ignorance for an equally important locus of reform in the structure of Darwinism — in­creasing knowledge of the nature of genomes and the mechanics of develop­ment. (I try to cover the outlines of important theoretical critiques from this "opposite" realm of the smallest, but the relative weightings in my text reflect my own varying competencies far more than the merits of the cases. For ex­ample, although I do discuss, and perhaps even adequately outline, the im­portance of Kimura and King's neutralist theory in questioning previous as­sumptions of adaptationist hegemony, I surely do not give an appropriate volume of attention to this enormously important subject.)

但是我也深知，任何优势都会伴随着相应的不足。就我个人而言，专注于古生物学研究的同时，也让我对达尔文主义理论体系改革中另一个同样重要的领域知之甚少 —— 那就是我们对基因组本质和发育机制的日益深入的认识。（我试图概述来自这个与古生物学相对的微观领域中重要的理论批评。但是在我的著作中，各个主题所占的比重与其实际重要性并不相称，更多地反映了我个人专业知识的局限性。举例来说，虽然我确实探讨了 Kimura 和 King 的中性理论，并可能较好地概述了它在挑战传统适应主义主导地位方面的重要性，但我显然没有对这个极其重要的课题给予足够的关注。）





Nonetheless, I hope that I have managed to present an adequate account of the coordinating themes that grant such interest and coherence to modern reformulations of the structure of evolutionary theory. Such thematic consis­tency in revision becomes possible largely because Darwin himself, in his characteristically brilliant way, tied the diverse threads of his initiating argu­ment into an overall view with a similarly tight structure — thus granting clear definition to his own commitments, and also permitting their revision in the form of an equally coherent "package." I would argue, moreover, and with­out wishing to become extravagantly hagiographical (for I wrote this book, after all, primarily to discuss a critique and revision of strict Darwinism), that our modern sense of limitations in the canonical version arises from decisions that Darwin made for tough and correct reasons in the context of his initiat­ing times — reasons that made his account the first operational theory of evolution in modern science. In particular, as Chapter 2 will discuss in detail, Darwin converted evolution from untestable speculation to doable science by breaking through the old paradox (as embedded most prominently in Lamarck's system) of contrasting a palpable force of small-scale change that could do little in extension, with a basically nonoperational (and orthogonal) mechanism of large-scale change putatively responsible for all the interesting patterns of life's history, but imperceptible and untestable from the uniformitarian study of modern organisms.

尽管如此，我希望我已经成功地阐明了一个重要观点：是什么核心思想将现代进化理论的重新诠释变得如此引人入胜且逻辑连贯。这种修订过程中体现出的思想一致性之所以成为可能，主要归功于达尔文本人。他以其特有的卓越智慧，将其开创性理论中的各个要素编织成一个结构严密的整体观点。这不仅清晰地界定了他的核心主张，同时也为后人提供了一个可以系统性修订的完整理论框架。

我还想指出一点（当然不是要过分美化达尔文，毕竟我写这本书主要是为了探讨对严格达尔文主义的批评和修订）：我们今天所认识到的经典理论的局限性，实际上源于达尔文在其开创时期基于充分且正确的理由所做出的决定 —— 正是这些决定使他的理论成为现代科学中第一个可操作的进化理论。特别是，正如第二章将详细讨论的那样，达尔文突破了一个长期存在的悖论（这一悖论在拉马克的理论体系中表现得最为明显），从而将进化研究从纯粹的推测转变为切实可行的科学。这个悖论涉及两个方面：一方面是显而易见但影响有限的微观变化力量，另一方面是一个基本上无法操作（且与前者相互独立）的宏观变化机制。后者虽然被认为是造就生命历史中所有有趣模式的原因，但从现代生物的均变论（uniformitarian）研究角度来看，却难以观察和验证。

By claiming that the small-scale mechanics of modern change could, by extension, explain all of evolution, Darwin opened the entire field to empirical study. And yet, as Hegel and so many other students of change have noted, progress in human (and other) affairs tends to spiral upwards in cycles of pro­posal (thesis), then countered by opposition (antithesis), and finally leading to a new formulation combining the best aspects of both competitors (synthe­sis). Darwin's thesis established evolution as a science, but his essential com­mitments, as expressed in the three legs of his necessary logical tripod (or the three branches of his conceptual tree or coral, as in the alternate metaphor of Fig. 1-4), eventually proved too narrow and confining, thus requiring an an­tithesis of extension and reformulation on each branch, and leading — or so this book maintains as a central thesis of its own — to a still newer and richer synthesis expressing our best current understanding of the structure of evolu­tionary theory.

Darwin（达尔文）认为当代生物变化的微观机制可以用来解释所有的进化现象，这一观点为进化研究开启了实证科学的大门。然而，正如 Hegel（黑格尔）和其他许多研究变迁规律的学者所观察到的，人类社会（以及其他领域）的发展往往遵循着螺旋式上升的规律：先有观点提出（正），继而出现对立观点（反），最终形成融合双方优点的新观点（合）。达尔文的理论确立了进化学作为一门科学的地位，但他的核心主张（如同他的逻辑推理中三个必要支柱，或如图 1-4 所示的概念树、珊瑚的三个分支）最终被证明过于局限。这就需要在每个分支上进行扩展和重新诠释，形成一种对立观点。而本书的核心论点正是：这一过程最终导向了一个更新更丰富的综合理论，这个理论体现了我们对进化论框架的最新理解。

In fact, and to repeat my summary in this different form, one might encapsulate the long argument of this book in such a Hegelian format. Pre-Darwinian concepts of evolution remained speculative and essentially nonoperational, largely because (see Chapter 3) they fell into the disabling para­dox of contrasting an effectively unknowable large-scale force of cosmic progress against an orthogonal, palpable and testable small-scale force that could generate local adaptation and diversity, but that couldn't, in principle, explain the macroevolutionary pattern of life. Then Darwin, in his thesis (also an antithesis to these earlier sterile constructions), brilliantly argued that the putative large-scale force did not exist, and that all evolution could be explained by upward extrapolation from the small-scale force, now prop­erly understood as natural selection. In a first stage of debate during the late 19th and early 20th centuries (Chapters 3–6), most critiques of Darwinism — one might designate them as a first round of ultimately destructive antithe­ses — simply denied sufficient agency, efficacy and range to natural selection, and reasserted the old claim of duality, with selection relegated to triviality, and some truly contrary force sought as the explanation for major features of evolution. Strict Darwinism eventually fended off these destructive critiques, reasserted itself in the triumphant, and initially (and generously) pluralistic form of the Modern Synthesis, but eventually calcified into a "hardened" ver­sion (Chapter 7).

实际上，如果用另一种方式重述我的总结，我们可以用黑格尔的思维方式来概括本书的核心论点。在达尔文之前，进化概念仍停留在推测阶段，基本上无法付诸实践，这主要是因为（见第 3 章）它们陷入了一个难以解决的矛盾：一方面是一个本质上无法验证的、推动宇宙进步的宏观力量，另一方面是一个显而易见、可以检验但与之相互独立的微观力量。这种微观力量虽然可以解释局部适应和多样性，但原则上无法解释生命的宏观进化模式。随后，达尔文在他的理论中（这同时也是对早期这些无效理论的反驳）巧妙地论证了所谓的宏观力量根本不存在，所有的进化现象都可以通过微观层面的力量推演而来，这种力量就是我们现在所理解的自然选择。在 19 世纪末 20 世纪初的第一阶段辩论中（第 3-6 章），对达尔文主义的大多数批评 —— 我们可以将它们视为第一轮最终被证明具有破坏性的反命题 —— 仅仅是否定了自然选择的影响力、有效性和作用范围，并重新强调了二元论的旧观点，将选择机制贬低为次要因素，转而寻求其他完全相反的力量来解释进化的主要特征。严格的达尔文主义最终战胜了这些具有破坏性的批评，并以现代综合理论的形式重新确立了自己。这种理论最初是胜利的、包容的、多元化的，但最终演变成了一个「僵化」的版本（第 7 章）。

Then, in a strikingly different, and ultimately fruitful, second round of antitheses, a renewed debate about central theoretical issues arose during the last three decades of the 20th century, and reshaped the field by recognizing that selection needed to be amplified, reformulated and invigorated by other, noncontrary (and, at most, orthogonal) causes, not rejected as wrong, or scorned as trivial (Chapters 8–12). The one long argument of this book holds that a synthesis (still much in progress) has now sufficiently coagulated from this debate to designate our best current understanding of the structure of evolutionary theory as something rich and new, with a firmly retained basis in Darwinian logic — in other words, and following the organizing and opening metaphor of this chapter, as a validation of Falconer's, rather than Darwin's, concept of the historical growth and change of Milan's cathedral.

在 20 世纪的最后三十年，一场全新且最终富有成效的争论出现了。这场关于核心理论问题的辩论重新兴起，它重塑了这一领域。人们认识到，自然选择理论需要其他互补性的（最多只是独立的）因素来丰富、重新诠释和加强，而不是将其否定为错误或贬低为无关紧要（第 8-12 章）。本书贯穿始终的核心论述认为，这场辩论已经孕育出一个新的综合理论（尽管仍在不断发展中）。这个理论代表了我们目前对进化理论结构的最佳理解，它既丰富又创新，同时也坚实地保留了达尔文思想的基础。换句话说，呼应本章开篇的比喻，这印证了 Falconer 而非 Darwin 对米兰大教堂发展演变的见解。

Ariel's telling verse in Shakespeare's The Tempest proclaims in dense metaphor:

Full fathom five thy father lies;

Of his bones are coral made;

Those are pearls that were his eyes:

Nothing of him that doth fade

But doth suffer a sea-change

Into something rich and strange.

莎士比亚《暴风雨》中，精灵 Ariel 用这样富有隐喻的诗句唱道：

深海五寻埋父身；

他的骨骼化作珊瑚；

昔日眼眸今作明珠：

他的形骸虽已消散却化作海洋永恒的篇章

变成了富有而奇特的事物。

With the exception of one possible (and originally unintended) modern reading of these images, this famous and haunting verse provides a beautiful description of both the priceless worth and intriguing modern transformation of Darwin's original theory. (For the exception, several connotations of deep burial in the sea — full fathom five — might be viewed negatively, as in "deep sixing" or going to Davy Jones's locker. But, for natural historians who read this book, and coming from an invertebrate paleontologist as author, the seafloor could not represent a more positive resting place or point of origin — and I intend to evoke only these upbeat images in citing Ariel's lines.) Other­wise, Darwin's original structure has only yielded greater treasure in cascad­ing implications and developments through the subsequent history of evolu­tionary thought — the conversion of the bones of an original outline into precious coral and pearls of current substance. Nothing of Darwin's central logic has faded or fully capsized, but his theory has been transformed, along his original lines, into something far different, far richer, and far more ade­quate to guide our understanding of nature.

这句出自莎士比亚《暴风雨》中 Ariel 的著名诗句令人难忘，它完美地描述了达尔文原始理论的无价价值及其在现代的精彩蜕变，当然除了这些意象可能存在的一种（原本并非刻意为之的）现代解读。（说到这个例外，「五英寻深」（约 9 米深）的深海埋藏可能会让人联想到一些消极的含义，比如「永远沉没」或「葬身大海」。不过，对于阅读这本书的自然历史学家来说，特别是对我这个无脊椎动物古生物学家而言，海底恰恰代表着最理想的安息之地和生命的发源地 —— 在引用 Ariel 的诗句时，我只想传达这些充满希望的意象。）此外，随着进化思想的历史发展，达尔文的原始理论框架不断衍生出更多珍贵的启示 —— 就像将原始的骨架转化为今天这些珍贵的珊瑚和明珠。达尔文的核心逻辑不仅没有丝毫褪色或被推翻，反而沿着他最初设定的方向，发展成了一个截然不同、更加丰富，也更能帮助我们理解自然界的理论体系。

The last three lines of Shakespeare's verse also appear on the tombstone of the great poet Percy Bysshe Shelley (also the author of the preface to his wife's novella, Frankenstein, which cites Erasmus Darwin in its first line of text). I believe that these words would suit, and honor, Charles Darwin just as well and just as rightly.

莎士比亚诗歌的最后三行也刻在伟大诗人 Percy Bysshe Shelley 的墓碑上（他也是《Frankenstein》序言的作者，而这本由他妻子所著的小说，在开篇第一行就引用了 Erasmus Darwin）。我认为这些文字用来纪念 Charles Darwin 同样恰如其分，意义非凡。

### 1.3 Apologia Pro Vita Sua

为我生命辩护（Apologia Pro Vita Sua)

#### A Time to Keep

留存的时光

The Preacher spoke ever so truly in writing his famous words (Ecclesiastes 3:1-7): "For every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose ... A time to break down, and a time to build up ... A time to rend, and a time to sew: a time to keep silence, and a time to speak." Evolutionary theory now stands in the happier second state of these genuine dichotomies (in part be­cause the first state had been mined to the limited extent of its utility): we live in a time for building up, for sewing together, and for speaking out.

《圣经》中的传道者曾写下这样一段充满智慧的话（传道书 3:1-7）：「凡事都有它的季节，天下万物都有它的时辰... 有拆毁的时候，也有建造的时候... 有撕裂的时候，也有缝补的时候，有保持沉默的时候，也有开口说话的时候。」如今，进化理论已经迈入了这些对立阶段中更为积极的第二阶段（这部分是因为第一阶段的价值已经被充分发掘)：我们正处在一个适合建设、融合与勇于发声的时代。

Not all times are such good times, and not all scientists win the good for­tune to live within these times of motion. For theories grow as organisms do, with periods of Sturm und Drang, long latencies of youth or ossifications of age, and some happy times of optimally productive motion in between (an­other Goldilockean phenomenon). I recently studied the life and career of E. Ray Lankester (Gould, 1999a), clearly the most talented evolutionary morphologist of the generation just after Darwin. He did "good" work and had a "good" career (see Chapter 10, pages 1069–1076 for his best theoretical efforts), but he never transcended the ordinary. Perhaps the limitation lay largely within his own abilities. However, I rather suspect that he did possess both the temperamental gumption and the requisite intellectual might — but that the tools of major empirical advance just didn't emerge in his generation, for he remained stuck in a relatively unproductive middle, as Darwin had seized the first-fruits from traditional data of natural history, and the second plucking required a resolution of genetic mechanisms.

并非所有时代都是这样的黄金时期，也并非所有科学家都有幸生活在这些充满变革的时代。因为理论的发展就像生物的成长一样，会经历动荡变革期、漫长的青春期潜伏或老年期的僵化，而在这些阶段之间，偶尔会出现一些恰到好处的高产期（这是另一个「适中原则」现象，就像金发姑娘童话中寻找最合适的事物一样）。我最近研究了 E. Ray Lankester 的生平和职业生涯（Gould，1999a），他无疑是达尔文之后那一代最有才华的进化形态学家（evolutionary morphologist）。他做出了「不错」的研究，也有着「不错」的职业生涯（详见第 10 章，第 1069-1076 页中关于他最出色的理论贡献），但他始终未能超越平凡。这种局限或许主要源于他个人能力的限制。然而，我倒是怀疑他其实具备了必要的个人魄力和智力水平 —— 只是在他那个时代，推动重大实证研究的工具尚未出现。他被困在了一个相对缺乏突破的时期：达尔文已经采摘了传统自然历史研究的第一批果实，而要进行第二轮突破，则需要首先理解遗传机制。

I felt a similar kind of frustration in 1977, after writing my first technical book, Ontogeny and Phylogeny (see Chapter 10, pages 1061–1063). I had spent the best years of a young career on a subject that I knew to be rele­vant (at a time when most of the profession had forgotten). But then defeat snatched my prize from the jaws of victory. I am proud of the book, and I do believe that it helped to focus interest on a subject that became doable soon thereafter. But I ran up against a wall right at the end — for the genetics of de­velopment clearly held the key to any rapprochement of embryology and evo­lution, and we knew effectively nothing about eukaryotic regulation. Indeed, as we could then only characterize structural genes by electrophoretic tech­niques, our major "arguments" for regulatory effects (if they even merited such a positive designation) invoked such negative evidence as the virtual identity in structural genes between chimps and humans, coupled with a fair visceral sense of extensive phenotypic disparity in anatomy and behavior — with the differences then attributed to regulatory genes that we could not, at the time, either study or even identify.

1977 年，在完成我的第一本技术著作《个体发生与系统发生》（见第 10 章，第 1061-1063 页）后，我感受到了类似的挫折感。我将年轻时期最宝贵的职业生涯投入到一个我深知重要的课题研究中（那时大多数同行都已将这个领域抛之脑后）。但就在即将成功之际，我却功亏一篑。尽管我为这本书感到自豪，也相信它确实帮助提升了人们对这个随后不久就变得可行的研究课题的关注度。但是在最后阶段我遇到了一个难以逾越的障碍 —— 发育遗传学显然是连接胚胎学和进化论的关键，而当时我们对真核生物的调控机制却几乎一无所知。事实上，在那个年代，我们只能通过电泳技术（electrophoretic techniques）来研究结构基因，我们关于调控效应的主要「论据」（如果这些证据真的称得上是论据的话）仅仅依赖于一些间接证据，比如黑猩猩和人类之间结构基因的几乎完全一致，以及我们对它们在解剖结构和行为上存在显著差异的本能认知 —— 这些差异当时被认为是由调控基因造成的，而这些基因在当时我们既无法研究也无法识别。

By sheer good fortune (abetted in minuscule ways by my own pushes and those of my paleontological colleagues), the field moved fast and I lived long enough to witness a sea change (if I may cite Ariel yet again) towards potentiation on all three major intellectual and social substrates for con­verting a subject from great promise combined with even more frustrating inoperability, into a discipline bursting with new (and often utterly surpris­ing) data that led directly to testable hypotheses about basic issues in the structure of evolutionary theory.

得益于纯粹的好运（当然也有我自己和古生物学同事们的些许推动），这个领域发展迅速。我很幸运地活到现在，得以见证了这一领域发生的根本性转变（容我再次引用 Ariel 的说法）。这种转变体现在三个主要的学术和社会层面上，让这个领域从一个充满希望但难以开展实际研究的课题，蜕变为一个充满新发现的蓬勃学科。这些新发现往往出人意料，并直接促成了许多关于进化理论基本问题的可验证假说。

Empirics. During the last third of the 20th century, new techniques and conceptualizations opened up important sources of data that challenged orthodox formulations for all three branches of essential Darwinian logic. To cite just one relevant example for each branch, theoretical development and accumulating data on punctuated equilibrium allowed us to reconceptualize species as genuine Darwinian individuals, fully competent to participate in processes of selection at their own supraorganismic (and suprademal) level — and then to rethink macroevolution as the differential success of species rather than the extended anagenesis of organismal adaptation (see Chapter 9). This validation of the species-individual aided the transformation of what had begun as a particular argument about group (or interdemic) selection into a fully generalized hierarchical theory, with good cases then documented from the genic to the cladal level (see Chapter 8).

实证研究。在 20 世纪最后三分之一时期，新的技术和概念化方法为我们开启了重要的数据来源，这些数据对达尔文进化论三个基本逻辑分支的传统解释都提出了挑战。让我们分别举一个相关例子：关于间断平衡（punctuated equilibrium）理论的发展和数据积累，使我们能够重新认识物种作为真正的达尔文个体的本质，使它们能够在高于个体生物体（和种群）的层面上完全参与自然选择过程。这让我们得以重新思考宏观进化的本质 —— 它更像是物种间的优胜劣汰，而非单个生物体逐渐适应的过程（参见第 9 章）。这种对物种个体概念的确认，推动了一个重要的理论转变：从最初关于群体选择（或群体间选择）的具体论述，发展成为一个完整的分层理论体系，并在从基因到进化枝组（cladal）的各个层面都找到了充分的证据支持（参见第 8 章）。

On the second branch of full efficacy for natural selection as an externalist and functionalist process, the stunning discoveries of extensive deep homologies across phyla separated by more than 500 million years (particularly the vertebrate homologs of arthropod Hox genes) — against explicit statements by architects of the Modern Synthesis (see p. 539) that such homologies could not exist in principle, in a world dominated by their conception of nat­ural selection — forced a rebalancing or leavening of Darwinian functionalism with previously neglected, or even vilified, formalist perspectives based on the role of historical and structural constraints in channeling directions of evolu­tionary change, and causing the great dumpings and inhomogeneities of morphospace — phenomena that had previously been attributed almost exclu­sively to functionalist forces of natural selection.

关于自然选择作为外部主义（externalist）和功能主义（functionalist）过程的完全有效性这一问题的第二个分支上，科学家们做出了一个惊人的发现：在进化上分离超过 5 亿年的不同门（phyla）之间存在大量深度同源性，特别是在脊椎动物和节肢动物的 Hox 基因之间。这一发现与现代综合理论奠基者们的明确观点相矛盾（见第 539 页），他们曾断言在由自然选择主导的世界中，这种同源性在原则上是不可能存在的。这个发现促使我们不得不重新审视达尔文的功能主义观点，将其与此前被忽视甚至诋毁的形式主义（formalist）观点进行调和。这种形式主义观点强调历史和结构约束在引导进化方向中的重要作用，并解释了为什么生物形态空间会呈现出显著的聚集现象和不均匀分布。这些现象在过去几乎完全被归因于自然选择的功能主义作用。

On the third branch of extrapolation, the discovery and relatively quick validation, beginning in 1980, of a truly catastrophic trigger for at least one great mass extinction (the K-T event of 65 million years ago), fractured the uniformitarian consensus, embraced by a century of paleontological compla­cency, that all apparent faunal overturns could be "spread out" into sufficient time for explanation by ordinary causes under plausible intensifications that would not alter conventional modes of evolution and extinction.

在科学外推研究的第三个方向上，科学家们在 1980 年发现并较快证实了一个具有毁灭性的事件触发因素。这个发现至少解释了一次重大物种大灭绝 —— 6500 万年前的白垩纪 - 第三纪灭绝事件（K-T event）。这一发现打破了古生物学界持续了近百年的渐变论（uniformitarian consensus）观点。在此之前，研究者们一直认为所有看似突然的生物群落变化都可以被「分散」到更长的时间跨度中去解释，认为这些变化只是由普通原因在逐步加强的情况下造成的，而不会对传统的生物进化和灭绝理论造成冲击。

Moreover, as we shall see, these three apparently rather different kinds of data and their attendant critiques cohere into a revised general structure for evolutionary theory — thus marking our age as a time for building up and not only as a time for breaking down.

此外，正如我们即将看到的，这三种看似迥然不同的数据形式以及随之而来的各种评判，最终汇聚形成了一个革新版的进化理论框架。这标志着我们所处的时代不仅仅是一个推陈的年代，更是一个布新的时期。

Concepts. Following the Kantian dictum that percepts without con­cepts are blind, but concepts without percepts empty, these two categories interpenetrate as "pure" data suggest novel ideas (how can one not rethink the causes of mass extinction when evidence surfaces for a bolide, 7-10 km in diameter, and packing 104 the megatonnage of all the earth's nuclear weapons combined), whereas "abstract" concepts then taxonomize the natural world in different ways, often "creating" data that had never been granted enough previous intellectual space even to be conceived (as when punctuated equilib­rium made stasis a theoretically meaningful and interesting phenomenon, and not just an embarrassing failure to detect "evolution," in its traditional definition of gradual change — and paleontologists then began active stud­ies of a subject that had previously been ignored as uninteresting, if conceptualized at all). But, speaking parochially as a student of the fossil record, I can at least say that the conceptual revolution in macroevolutionary thinking re­vitalized the field of paleobiology (even creating the name as a subdiscipline of paleontological endeavor). Whatever the varied value of different individ­ual efforts in this burgeoning field, we may at least be confident that our pro­fession will no longer be humiliated as a synecdoche for ossified boredom among the natural sciences — as Nature did in 1969 when editorializing about the salutary value of plate tectonics in revitalizing the geological sciences: "Scientists in general might be excused for assuming that most geologists are paleontologists and most paleontologists have staked out a square mile as their life's work. A revamping of the geologist's image is badly needed" (Anonymous, 1969, p. 903).

概念。按照康德的论断，感性认识（percepts）没有概念是盲目的，而概念没有感性认识则是空洞的。这两个范畴是相互渗透的：一方面，「纯粹」数据会激发新的想法。比如当我们发现了一个直径 7-10 公里的天体撞击证据，其威力相当于地球上所有核武器总当量的 10,000 倍时，我们不得不重新思考大规模灭绝的成因。另一方面，「抽象」概念则以新的方式对自然界进行分类，往往能「创造」出此前从未被重视甚至无法想象的数据。就像间断平衡理论（punctuated equilibrium）让演化停滞（stasis）成为了一个具有理论意义和研究价值的现象，而不再只是未能检测到「进化」（按照传统定义中的渐进变化）的尴尬证据。这促使古生物学家开始积极研究这个此前被忽视或完全未被概念化的主题。

作为一名化石记录研究者，我至少可以说，宏观进化（macroevolution）思维的概念革命振兴了古生物学领域，甚至创造了「古生物学」（paleobiology）这个作为古生物研究的分支学科的名称。无论这个蓬勃发展的领域中各项研究的价值有何不同，我们至少可以确信，我们的学科不会再像 1969 年《自然》（Nature）杂志社论中所说的那样，成为自然科学中死气沉沉、令人生厌的代名词。当时这篇社论在评价板块构造理论对地质科学的积极影响时写道：「科学界普遍认为大多数地质学家都是古生物学家，而大多数古生物学家一生的研究范围仅限于一平方英里的区域。地质学家的形象亟待改观。」（Anonymous，1969，第 903 页）。

The intricate and multifaceted concepts that have nuanced and altered the central logic on all three branches of Darwinism's essential postulates repre­sent ideas of broad ramification and often remarkably subtle complexity, as we vain scientists soon discovered in our fractured bubbles of burst pride — for we had been so accustomed to imagining that an evening in an armchair could conquer any merely conceptual issue, whereas we all acknowledge the substantial time and struggle that empirical problems, demanding collection and evaluation of data, often require. Yet, on these basic questions in formu­lating evolutionary theory, we often read and thought for months, and ended up more confused than when we began.

作为科学家，我们曾经都有些自负，以为只要在安乐椅上思考一个晚上就能解决任何概念性的问题。我们都知道，实证研究需要大量时间来收集和分析数据，这一点我们都心知肚明。然而在研究进化论的过程中，我们很快就发现，那些影响达尔文主义三大基本假设的复杂概念，不仅涵盖面极广，而且极其精妙。关于这些进化理论的基本问题，我们往往需要花费数月的时间来阅读和思考，但最终却常常比开始研究时更加困惑。

The general solution to such procedural dilemmas lies in a social and intellectual activity that scientists do tend to understand and practice better than colleagues in most other academic disciplines — collaboration. Far more than most colleagues, I have tended to work alone in my professional life and pub­lication. But for each of the conceptually difficult and intellectually manifold issues of reevaluation for the central logic of the three essential Darwinian postulates, I desperately needed advice, different skills, and the give and take of argument, from colleagues who complemented my limited expertise with their equally centered specialties and aptitudes for other aspects of these large and various problems. Thus, on the first leg or branch of hierarchy theory, I worked with Niles Eldredge on punctuated equilibrium, and with Elisabeth Vrba on levels of selection and sorting. On the second leg of structuralist al­ternatives to adaptationist argument, I worked with Dick Lewontin on span­drels, Elisabeth Vrba on exaptation, David Woodruff on the functional and structural morphology of Cerion, and with "the gang of four" (increased to five with the later inclusion of Jack Sepkoski) — Dave Raup, Tom Schopf, Dan Simberloff, and me — on trying to specify how many aspects of apparently or­dered phyletic patterns, heretofore confidently attributed to selection for little reason beyond the visual appearance of order itself, could plausibly be gener­ated within purely random systems. And on the third leg of extrapolationism, my earliest interests in the logic and justification of uniformitarianism in phi­losophy, and of Lyellian perspectives in the history of science, could not have developed without advice and substantial aid (but not collaborative publica­tion this time) with historians Martin Rudwick, Reijer Hooykaas, and Cecil Schneer, and with philosophers Nelson Goodman, Bonnie Hubbard, and George Geiger. (Geiger, my mentor at Antioch College, was the last student of John Dewey and played with Lou Gehrig on the Columbia University base­ball team, thus embodying both my professional and avocational interests.)

面对这样的研究困境，科学家们往往会采用一种他们比其他学科同行更擅长的方法 —— 协作研究。虽然相比多数同行，我在学术生涯中更倾向于独立工作和发表，但在重新评估达尔文三个基本假设的核心逻辑这一概念复杂且需要多方面智识的课题时，我确实迫切需要其他同事的建议、不同的专业技能以及思想交流。这些同事们的专业特长正好能够弥补我知识上的不足。

在研究的第一个方向即层级理论时，我与 Niles Eldredge 合作研究了断续平衡论（Punctuated Equilibrium），并与 Elisabeth Vrba 共同探讨了选择和分类的各个层次。在第二个研究方向，即探索适应论之外的结构主义解释时，我与 Dick Lewontin 研究了构件演化（Spandrels），与 Elisabeth Vrba 研究了功能借用（Exaptation），与 David Woodruff 一起研究了陆螺（Cerion）的功能和结构形态学。我还加入了「四人帮」（后来增加到五人，因为 Jack Sepkoski 的加入）—— 包括 Dave Raup、Tom Schopf、Dan Simberloff 和我自己。我们试图探究那些表面上呈现有序的进化模式中，有多少其实可能是随机过程产生的，而不是像之前想当然地认为都是自然选择的结果。

在第三个研究方向即外推论方面，我早期对哲学中均变论的逻辑基础，以及对莱尔在科学史上观点的兴趣，得到了多位学者的帮助。虽然没有共同发表论文，但历史学家 Martin Rudwick、Reijer Hooykaas 和 Cecil Schneer，以及哲学家 Nelson Goodman、Bonnie Hubbard 和 George Geiger 都给予了我宝贵的建议和实质性帮助。特别值得一提的是 Geiger，他是我在安提阿学院的导师，也是 John Dewey 的最后一位学生。有趣的是，他曾与 Lou Gehrig 一起在哥伦比亚大学棒球队效力，这让他完美地融合了我的学术追求和个人爱好。

In fact, and as a comment within the sociology of science, I would venture that future historians might judge the numerous seminal (and published) collaborations between evolutionary biologists and professional philosophers of science as the most unusual and informative operational aspect of the reconstruction of evolutionary theory in the late 20th century. Research scientists tend to be a philistine lot, with organismic biologists perhaps at the head of this particular pack (for we work with "big things" that we can see and un­derstand at our own scale. Thus, we suppose that we can afford to be more purely empirical in our reliance on "direct" observation, and less worried about admittedly conceptual problems of evaluating things too small or too fast to see). Most of us would scoff at the prospect of working with a profes­sional philosopher, regarding such an enterprise as, at best, a pleasant waste of time and, at worst, an admission that our own clarity of thought had be­come addled (or at least as a fear that our colleagues would so regard our in­terdisciplinary collaboration).

实际上，从科学社会学的角度来看，我敢说，未来的历史学家可能会认为，20 世纪后期重建进化理论的过程中，最不寻常且最具启发性的现象，就是进化生物学家和专业科学哲学家之间开展的众多开创性研究合作（这些合作已经发表）。研究科学家通常对其他学科缺乏深入了解，其中研究生命体的生物学家可能是这方面的典型代表。这是因为我们研究的都是肉眼可见、在人类尺度上就能理解的「大物体」，因此我们觉得可以更多地依赖「直接」观察，采用纯粹的经验主义方法，而不太需要担心那些无法直接观察到的微小或快速现象所带来的概念性问题。我们大多数人会对与专业哲学家合作的想法嗤之以鼻，认为这样做充其量不过是一种令人愉快的时间浪费，更糟糕的是，这可能暗示我们自己的思维已经不够清晰了（或者至少我们担心同事们会这样看待我们的跨学科合作）。

And yet, the conceptual problems presented by theories based on causes operating at several levels simultaneously, of effects propagated up and down, of properties emerging (or not) at higher levels, of the interaction of random and deterministic processes, and of predictable and contingent influ­ence, have proven to be so complex, and so unfamiliar to people trained in the simpler models of causal flow that have served us well for centuries (see the next section on Zeitgeist), that we have had to reach out to colleagues ex­plicitly trained in rigorous thinking about such issues. Thus, we learned, to our humbling benefit, that conceptual muddles do not necessarily resolve themselves "automatically" just because a smart person — namely one of us, trained as a scientist — finally decides to apply some raw, naive brain power to the problem. Professional training in philosophy does provide a set of tools, modes and approaches, not to mention a feeling for common dangers and fal­lacies, that few scientists (or few "smart folks" of any untrained persuasion) are likely to possess by the simple good fortune of superior raw brainpower. (We might analogize this silly and vainglorious, although regrettably com­mon, belief to the more popular idea that great athletes should be able to ex­cel at anything physical by reason of their general bodily virtue — a myth and chimaera that dramatically exploded several years ago when Michael Jordan discovered that he could not learn to hit a curve ball, just because he excelled so preeminently in basketball, and possessed the world's best athletic body in general — for he ended up barely hitting over 0.200 in a full season of minor league play. I do, however, honor and praise his persistence in staying the course and taking his lumps.)

然而，现实中存在着许多复杂的理论问题：因果关系同时在多个层面发生作用，影响在不同层级之间向上向下传递，高层次上可能会（或不会）出现新的特性，随机过程与确定性过程相互作用，还有可预测和偶然因素的影响。这些问题的复杂程度远超想象。对于那些习惯了传统简单因果模型的人来说（详见下一节关于时代精神的讨论），这些概念都十分陌生，以至于我们不得不向专门研究这些深奥问题的哲学同事求助。

这让我们谦逊地认识到：即便是我们这些受过科学训练的所谓聪明人，仅凭直觉思考也无法自然而然地理清这些概念上的混乱。事实上，哲学专业的训练确实能够提供一套特殊的思维工具、方法论和研究路径，更重要的是它能够帮助人们识别常见的逻辑陷阱和谬误。这些能力不是单纯依靠聪明才智就能获得的。

（这种情况类似于一个常见但很天真的想法：认为顶尖运动员凭借其出色的身体素质就能在任何运动项目中表现出色。这个美好的幻想在几年前被 Michael Jordan 的经历彻底打破。尽管他是篮球界的超级巨星，拥有世界顶级的运动天赋，但在尝试转战棒球时，他发现自己无法掌握击打变化球这项技术，在整个小联盟赛季中的打击率仅略高于 0.200。不过，我非常敬佩他坚持到底、勇于接受挑战的精神。）

Indeed, I know of no other substantial conceptual advance in recent science so abetted by the active collaboration of working scientists and professional philosophers (thus obviating, for once, the perennial, and justified, complaint of philosophers of science that no scientists read their journals or even en­counter their analyses). Several key achievements in modern evolutionary theory, particularly the successful resolution of conceptual difficulties in for­mulating a workable theory of hierarchical selection (rooted in concepts like emergence and simultaneous selection at several levels that our minds, with their preferences for two-valued logics, don't handle either automatically, or well at all), have appeared as joint publications of biologists and philoso­phers, including the books of Sober and Wilson, 1998, and Eldredge and Grene, 1992; and articles of Sober and Lewontin, 1982, and Mayo and Gilinsky, 1987. My own understanding of how to formulate an operational theory of hierarchical selection, and my "rescue" from a crucial conceptual error that had stymied my previous thinking (see Chapter 8, pages 656–673), emerged from joint work with Elisabeth Lloyd, a professional philosopher of science. I take great pride in our two joint articles (Lloyd and Gould, 1993; Gould and Lloyd, 1999), which, in my partisan judgment, resolve what may have been the last important impediment to the codification of a conceptually coherent and truly operational theory of hierarchical selection.

在近代科学发展史上，我从未见过其他重大的概念性突破能像这样深深受益于一线科学家和专业哲学家的积极合作。这种合作终于打破了科学哲学家们长期以来的一个合理抱怨：科学家们从不读他们的期刊，也不关注他们的研究成果。

现代进化理论中的一些关键成就，尤其是在构建层级选择理论（hierarchical selection theory）方面取得的突破，都体现了这种合作的重要性。这个理论涉及涌现性（emergence）以及多层次同步选择等复杂概念，这些对于习惯于简单非黑即白思维方式的人类大脑来说都十分困难。这些成就以生物学家和哲学家联合发表的形式出现，包括 Sober 和 Wilson 1998 年的著作，Eldredge 和 Grene 1992 年的著作，以及 Sober 和 Lewontin 1982 年的文章，Mayo 和 Gilinsky 1987 年的文章。

我个人对如何建立一个可操作的层级选择理论的认知，以及我能够克服此前一个阻碍我思维的关键概念性误区（详见第 8 章，第 656-673 页），都要归功于与科学哲学家 Elisabeth Lloyd 的合作。我非常珍视我们共同发表的两篇文章（Lloyd and Gould，1993; Gould and Lloyd，1999）。我认为这些研究成果解决了建立一个概念严密且切实可行的层级选择理论道路上的最后一个重要障碍。

Zeitgeist. Although major revisions to the structure of evolutionary theory emerged mainly from the conventional substrates of novel data and clearer concepts, we should not neglect the admittedly fuzzier, but by no means unimportant, input from a distinctive social context, or intellectual "spirit of the times" (a literal meaning of Zeitgeist) that, at the dawn of a calendrical millennium, has suffused our general academic culture with a set of loosely coherent themes and concerns far more congenial with the broad revisions here proposed within evolutionary theory than any previous set of guiding concepts or presuppositions had been. Needless to say, Zeitgeists are two edged swords of special sharpness — for either they encourage sheeplike conformity with transient ghosts of time (another literal meaning of Zeitgeist) that will soon fade into oblivion, or they open up new paths to insights that previous ages could not even have conceptualized. Any intellectual would therefore be a fool to argue that conformity with a Zeitgeist manifests any preferential correlation with scientific veracity ipso facto. Zeitgeists can only suggest or facilitate.

时代精神。虽然进化论结构的重大修正主要来自新的实验数据和更清晰的理论概念这些常规途径，但我们也不能忽视另一个虽然不那么明确但同样重要的影响因素 —— 特定的社会环境，也就是我们所说的「时代精神」（Zeitgeist）。在这个千禧年之际，这种时代精神已经让整个学术界充满了一系列相互关联的主题和关注点。这些新的思潮与进化论中提出的广泛修正比以往任何理论框架都更加吻合。毫无疑问，时代精神就像一把异常锋利的双刃剑 —— 它可能让人们盲目追随一些转瞬即逝的潮流（这也是 Zeitgeist 的另一层含义），也可能开启一些在过去完全无法想象的新视角。因此，任何学者如果认为仅仅因为符合时代精神就能证明某个观点的科学正确性，那都是很不明智的。时代精神的作用仅限于提供启发和推动发展。

Nonetheless, we would be equally foolish in our naive empiricism if we claimed that major advances in science must be entirely data driven, and that social contexts can only act as barriers to our vision of nature's factuality. Both the social and scientific world were "ready" for evolution in the mid 19th century. People of equal intelligence could neither have formulated nor owned such a concept in Newton's generation, even if some hypothetical Dar­win had then advanced such a claim (and probably ended up in Bedlam for his troubles). In Chapter 2, I shall document not only this general readiness of Western science within the Zeitgeist of Darwin's time, but also the specific so­cial impetus that Darwin gained from studying the distinctive theories (also a product of the earlier Enlightenment Zeitgeist, and not accessible before) of Adam Smith and the Scottish economists. Thus, and by analogy a century later, the altered Zeitgeist of our own time may also facilitate a fruitful reconsideration of major evolutionary concepts that still bear the originating stamp of a Victorian scientific context strongly committed to unidirectional, single-level and deterministic views of natural causality — subtly controlling con­cepts that many scientists would now label as limiting and outmoded.

然而，如果我们天真地认为科学的重大进步必须完全依赖数据，而社会背景只能阻碍我们理解自然的事实，那也是错误的。十九世纪中叶，社会和科学界已经「做好了」接受进化论的准备。在牛顿时代，即便有人提出达尔文式的理论，具备同等智慧的人也无法理解或接受这样的概念（而且可能因而被认为有精神问题）。在第二章中，我将展示不仅是达尔文时代的西方科学已经准备好迎接这些思想，还包括达尔文从研究亚当·斯密和苏格兰经济学家独特理论中获得的具体社会推动力（这些理论是早期启蒙运动精神的产物，而在此前是无法获得的）。因此，以此类推，一个世纪后，我们时代的精神气质的改变，可能也有助于重新审视那些仍然带有维多利亚时代单向、单一层次和决定论自然因果观念的重大进化概念 —— 这些概念现在被许多科学家认为是限制性和过时的。

Although the next few paragraphs will be the most vague and impressionis­tic (I trust) of the entire book, I venture these ill-formulated statements about Zeitgeist because I feel that something important lurks behind my inability to express these inchoate thoughts with precision. I argue above (page 14) that the key concerns of the three essential branches of Darwinian logic might be identified as agency, efficacy and scope of natural selection. In each of these domains, I believe, the revised structure of evolutionary theory, as presented in this book, might be characterized as expansion and revision according to a set of coordinated principles, all consonant with our altered Zeitgeist vs. the scientific spirit of Darwin's own time. The modern revision seeks to replace Darwin's unifocal theory of organismic selection with a hierarchical account (leg one); his unidirectional theory of adaptational construction in the func­tionalist mode with a more balanced interaction of these external causes, treating internal (or structural) constraints primarily as positive channels, and not merely as limitations (leg two); and his unilevel theory of micro-evolutionary extrapolation with a model of distinctive but interacting modes of change, each characteristic for its tier of time. In short, a hierarchy of inter­acting levels, each important in a distinctive way, for Darwin's single locus; an interaction of environmental outsides with organic insides for Darwin's single direction of causal flow; and a set of distinctive temporal tiers for Dar­win's attempt to situate all causality in the single microevolutionary world of our own palpable moments.

尽管接下来的几段可能是整本书中最模糊和印象式的内容（我相信如此），我还是冒险提出这些关于时代精神（Zeitgeist）的模糊陈述，因为我觉得在我无法精确表达这些初步思想的背后潜藏着一些重要的东西。我在上文（第 14 页）提到，达尔文逻辑的三个基本分支的核心关注点可能可以被归纳为自然选择的能动性、效能和范围。在我看来，在这每一个领域中，本书所提出的修订进化理论结构可以被视为通过一组协调原则进行的扩展和修订，这与我们改变的时代精神相呼应，而不再是达尔文时代的科学精神。现代修订试图用一个分层的解释（第一部分）来取代达尔文的单一有机体选择理论；用一种更均衡的外部原因相互作用来取代他在功能主义模式下单向适应性构建的理论，将内部（或结构）约束主要视为积极的渠道，而不仅仅是限制（第二部分）；并用一种不同但相互作用的变化模式模型来取代他的微观进化推演的单一层次理论，每种变化模式都具有其特定时间层次的特征。简而言之，达尔文的单一位置被一个相互作用的层次体系所取代，每个层次都以其独特方式重要；达尔文的因果流单一方向被环境外部与有机内部的相互作用所取代；而达尔文试图将所有因果关系置于我们所处的单一微观进化时刻中的努力被一组不同的时间层次所取代。

I do sense a common underlying vision behind all these proposed reforms. Strict Darwinism, although triumphant within mid 20th century evolutionary theory, embodied several broad commitments (philosophical or metatheoretical, in the technical sense of these terms), more characteristic of 19th than of 20th century thought (and, obviously, not necessarily wrong, or even to be discounted, for this reason — as nothing can be more dangerous to the prog­ress of science than winds of fashion, and we do, after all, learn some things, and develop some fruitful approaches, with validity and staying power well beyond their time of origin and initial popularity). Some aspects of Darwin's formulation broke philosophical ground in a sense quite consonant with our modern Zeitgeist of emphasis upon complexity and interaction — particularly, Darwin's focus on the interplay of chance and necessity in sources of varia­tion vs. mode of selection. Indeed, Darwin paid the usual price for such inno­vation in the failure of nearly all his colleagues, even the most intellectually acute, to grasp such a radical underlying philosophy. But, in many command­ing respects, Darwinism follows the norms of favored scientific reasoning in his time.

我确实感受到这些提议的改革背后有一个共同的基本愿景。虽然严谨的达尔文主义在 20 世纪中期的进化理论中取得了胜利，但它体现了多种广泛的承诺，更多地反映了 19 世纪而非 20 世纪的思想（当然，这并不意味着这些承诺是错误的，或者应该被忽视，因为时尚的风潮往往是科学进步的障碍。我们确实学到了一些东西，并发展了一些有效且持久的方法，超越了它们的起源和最初的流行）。达尔文的理论在哲学上开辟了新的领域，这与我们现代强调复杂性和互动的时代精神非常一致，特别是他关注变异来源中的偶然性和必然性，以及选择模式的互动。实际上，达尔文为这种创新付出了代价，即几乎所有的同事，甚至是最有智慧的同事，都未能理解这种激进的基础哲学。然而，在许多重要方面，达尔文主义遵循了他那个时代中受欢迎的科学推理规范。

The logic of Darwin's formulation rests upon several preferences in scien­tific reasoning more characteristic of his time than of ours — preferences that many scientists would now view as unduly restrictive in their designation of a privileged locus of causality, a single direction of causal flow, and a smooth continuity in resulting effects. Classical Darwinism follows standard reduc­tionist preferences in designating the lowest level then available — the organ­ism, for Darwin — as an effectively unique locus of causality (the first leg of agency). In this sense, the efforts of Williams and Dawkins (see Chapter 8) to reduce the privileged locus even further to the genic level (perforce unavail­able to Darwin) should be read as a furthering and intensification of Darwin's intent — in other words, a basically conservative adumbration of Darwin's own spirit and arguments, and not the radical conceptual revision that some have imagined.

达尔文理论的逻辑基础是几种科学推理的偏好，这些偏好在他的时代更为典型，但在我们这个时代则有所不同。许多科学家现在可能会认为，这些偏好在确定特权性的因果位置、单一的因果流动方向以及结果效果的连续性方面过于限制。经典达尔文主义遵循标准的还原主义偏好，将当时可用的最低层次 —— 对于达尔文来说是有机体 —— 指定为有效的独特因果位置（因果作用的第一步）。从这个意义上来说，Williams 和 Dawkins 的努力（见第 8 章）是将特权位置进一步降低到基因水平（达尔文时代无法实现），应被视为对达尔文意图的进一步发展和强化。换句话说，这是对达尔文精神和论点的基本保守的延续，而不是一些人所想象的激进的概念修订。

At this single level of causality, classical Darwinism then envisages a similarly privileged direction of causal flow, as information from the environment (broadly construed, of course, to include other organisms as well as physical surroundings) must impact the causal agent (organisms struggling for repro­ductive success) and be translated, by natural selection, into evolutionary change. The organism supplies raw material in the form of "random" varia­tion, but does not "push back" to direct the flow of its own alteration from inside. Darwinism, in this sense, is a functionalist theory, leading to local ad­aptation as the environment proposes and natural selection disposes. Finally, classical Darwinism completes a trio of privileged causal places and conse­quently directional flows by postulating strict continuity in results, as local selection scales smoothly through the immensity of geological time to engen­der life's history by pure extrapolation of lowest-level modes and causes.

在这种单一层次的因果关系中，经典达尔文主义设想了一种特定方向的因果流动，即环境中的信息（广义上包括其他生物和物理环境）对因果主体（为生殖成功而奋斗的生物体）产生影响，并通过自然选择转化为进化变化。生物体提供变异的原材料，虽然这些变异是「随机的」，但生物体本身并不能主动改变这种变异的方向。达尔文主义在这个意义上是一种功能主义理论，导致生物体根据环境的要求进行局部适应，由自然选择来决定最终的适应结果。最后，经典达尔文主义通过假设进化结果的连续性，形成了一套特定的因果位置和方向流动的理论框架，认为局部选择的效果可以在地质时间的漫长过程中逐步积累，通过对最低层次模式和原因的简单外推，形成生命的历史。

By contrast, the common themes behind the reformulations defended in this book all follow from serious engagement with complexity, interaction, multiple levels of causation, multidirectional flows of influence, and pluralis­tic approaches to explanation in general — a set of integrated approaches that strongly contribute to the Zeitgeist of our moment. To anticipate and make a preemptive strike against the obvious counterattack from Darwinian tradi­tionalists, these alternative themes do not substitute a "laid back, laissez-faire, anything goes" kind of sloppy tolerance for contradiction and fuzziness in argument against the genuine rigor of old-line Darwinism. The social and psychological contributions of a Zeitgeist to the origin of hypotheses bear no logical relationship to any subsequent scientific defense and validation of the same hypotheses. Moreover, on this subject of test and confirmation, I es­pouse a rigorously conventional and rather old-fashioned "realist" view that an objective factual world exists "out there," and that science can access its ways and modes. Whatever the contribution of a Victorian Zeitgeist to Darwin's thinking, or of a contemporary Zeitgeist to our revisions, the dif­ferences are testable and subject to validation or disproof by the usual arma­mentarium of scientific methods. That is, either Darwin is right and effec­tively all natural selection occurs at the organismic level (despite the logical conceivability of other levels), or the hierarchical theory is right and several levels make interestingly different and vitally important simultaneous contributions to the overall pattern of evolution. The same ordinary form of testability can be applied to any other contrast between strict Darwinism and the revised and expanded formulations defended in this book.

相反，本书中所支持的各个重述共同主题，都是基于对复杂性、互动性、多层次因果关系、多方向影响流动以及多元化解释方法的深入探讨 —— 这些综合方法构成了我们这个时代的主流思潮。为了预先应对达尔文传统主义者可能的反对，必须说明，这些替代主题并不是用一种随意和放任的态度来替代旧式达尔文主义的严谨性。时代精神对假设起源的社会和心理影响，与任何后续对这些假设的科学验证没有逻辑关系。此外，在测试和确认方面，我坚持一种严格而传统的「现实主义」观点，即客观的事实世界是存在的，科学可以揭示其运作方式。不论是维多利亚时代的精神对达尔文思想的影响，还是当代精神对我们修订内容的影响，这些差异都可以通过常规科学方法进行验证或反驳。也就是说，可能达尔文是正确的，所有自然选择都发生在生物层面（尽管逻辑上可以存在其他层次），或者分层理论是正确的，有多个层次同时对整体进化模式做出重要且不同的贡献。相同的可测试性原则也适用于严格达尔文主义与本书所支持的修订和扩展之间的其他对比。

As the most striking general contrast that might be illuminated by reference to the different Zeitgeists of Darwin's time and our own, modern revisions for each essential postulate of Darwinian logic substitute mechanics based on in­teraction for Darwin's single locus of causality and directional flow of effects. Thus, for Darwin's near exclusivity of organismic selection, we now propose a hierarchical theory with selection acting simultaneously on a rising set of levels, each characterized by distinctive, but equally well-defined, Darwinian individuals within a genealogical hierarchy of gene, cell-lineage, organism, deme, species, and clade. The results of evolution then emerge from complex, but eminently knowable, interactions among these potent levels, and do not simply flow out and up from a unique causal locus of organismal selection.

要比较达尔文时代和我们这个时代的思想差异，最明显的一点是：现代科学对达尔文逻辑的基本假设进行了修订，用基于互动的机制取代了达尔文所强调的单一因果关系和效应的单向流动。达尔文强调的是有机体选择的独特性，而现代科学提出了一种层级理论，认为选择作用在多个层级上进行。这些层级包括基因、细胞谱系、有机体、种群、物种和谱系，每个层级都有独特但明确的达尔文个体。进化的结果是这些不同层级之间复杂而可理解的相互作用的产物，而不只是单一有机体选择的结果。

A similar substitution of interaction for directional flow then pervades the second branch of selection's efficacy, as Darwin's functionalist formulation — with unidirectional flow from an external environment to an isotropic or­ganic substrate that supplies "random" raw material but imposes no direc­tional vector of its own to "push back" from internal sources of constraint — yields to a truly interactive theory of balance between the functionalist Dar­winian "outside" of natural selection generated by environmental pressures, and a formalist "inside" of strong, interesting and positive constraints gen­erated by specific past histories and timeless structural principles. Finally, on the third and last branch of selection's range, the single and control­ling microevolutionary locus of Darwinian causality yields to a multileveled model of tiers of time, with a unified set of processes working in distinctive and characteristic ways at each scale, from allelic substitution in observable years to catastrophic decimation of global biotas. Thus, and in summary, for the unifocal and noninteractive Darwinian models of exclusively organismal selection, causal flow from an environmental outside to an organismal in­side, and a microevolutionary locus for mechanisms of change that smoothly extrapolate to all scales, we substitute a hierarchical selectionist theory of numerous interacting levels, a balanced and bidirectional flow of causal­ity between external selection and internal constraint (interaction of func­tionalist and structuralist perspectives), and causal interaction among tiers of time.

在选择效力的第二个分支中，我们用交互作用替代了定向流动。达尔文的功能主义理论认为，环境对有机体的影响是单向的，环境提供「随机」的原材料，而有机体本身不施加反向的约束力。然而，这个理论逐渐演变为一种交互理论，强调自然选择的「外部」作用与由历史和结构原则产生的「内部」约束之间的平衡。最后，在选择范围的第三个分支中，达尔文的微观进化理论被一个多层次的时间模型所取代。这个模型在不同的时间尺度上以独特的方式运作，从短时间内的等位基因替换到长时间内全球生物群体的剧变。因此，总结来说，传统的达尔文模型强调单一的、非交互的生物体选择，以及从环境到生物体的单向因果流动，而现在我们用一个多层次的选择理论所取代，这个理论强调外部选择与内部约束之间的双向因果流动，以及时间层次之间的因果交互。

Among the many consequences of these interactionist reformulations, punctuational rather than continuationist models of change (with stronger structuralist components inevitably buttressing the punctuational versions) may emerge as the most prominent and most interesting. The Darwinian me­chanics of functionalism yield an expectation of continuously improving lo­cal adaptation, with longterm stability representing the achievement of an optimum. But interactionist and multi-leveled models of causality reconcep­tualize stasis as a balance, actively maintained among potentially competing forces at numerous levels, with change then regarded as exceptional rather than intrinsically ticking most of the time, and punctuational rather than smoothly continuous when it does occur (representing the relatively quick transition that often accompanies a rebalancing of forces).

在重新思考互动论的过程中，断续变化模型相比持续变化模型可能更为突出和有趣。这些模型通常伴随着更强的结构主义成分来支持断续版本。根据功能主义的达尔文机制，我们可以预期局部适应会不断改善，长期稳定则意味着达到了最优状态。然而，互动论和多层次因果模型将「停滞」视为在多个层次上维持平衡的结果，这种平衡是不同力量之间的竞争所造成的。因此，变化被认为是偶发的，而非在大多数时间内自动发生的。当变化确实出现时，它往往是断续的，而不是平滑连续的，这通常反映了力量重新平衡时的快速过渡。

To end this admittedly vague section with the punch of paradox (and even with a soundbite), I would simply note the almost delicious irony that the for­mulation of a hierarchical theory of selection — the central concept of this book, and invoking a non-vernacular meaning of hierarchy in the purely structural sense of rising levels of inclusivity — engenders, as its most impor­tant consequence, the destruction of a different and more familiar meaning of hierarchy: that is, the hierarchy of relative value and importance embod­ied in Darwin's privileging of organismic selection as the ultimate source of evolutionary change at all scales. Thus, a structural and descriptive hierarchy of equally effective causal levels undermines a more conventional hierarchy of relative importance rooted in Darwin's exclusive emphasis on the micro-evolutionary mechanics of organismal selection. And so, this structuralist view of nature's order enriches the structure of evolutionary theory — carry­ing the difference between strict Darwinism and our current understanding through more than enough metatheoretical space to fashion a Falconerian, not merely a Darwinian, rebuilding and extension for our edifice of coherent explanation.

为了通过悖论的方式，再加上一些引人注目的语句来结束这个相对模糊的部分，我想简单地指出一个让人感到有趣的讽刺：层级选择理论是本书的核心概念，其定义上的层级是指包容性逐级上升的结构。然而，这个理论的一个重要结果却是破坏了另一种更常见的层级概念：即达尔文将生物选择视为所有尺度上进化变化的最终来源所体现的相对价值和重要性。因此，一个同等有效的因果层级的结构性和描述性层级削弱了一个更为传统的层级，这个传统层级基于达尔文对生物选择微观进化机制的强调。因此，自然秩序的这种结构主义观点丰富了进化理论的结构，使得我们能够在严格的达尔文主义和当前的理解之间，利用足够的理论空间，构建一个不仅仅是达尔文式的，而是法尔科纳式的解释结构的重建和扩展。

#### A Personal Odyssey

个人的旅程

For reasons beyond mere self-indulgence or egotism, I believe that defenders of such general theories about large realms of nature owe their readers some explanation for the personal bases and ontogeny of their choices — for at this level of abstraction, no theory can claim derivation by simple logical or em­pirical necessity from observed results, and all commitments, however well defended among alternative possibilities, will also be influenced by authorial preferences of a more contingent nature that must then be narrated in order to be understood. Moreover, and in this particular case, the structure of this book includes a set of vigorously idiosyncratic features that, if not acknowl­edged and justified, might obscure the far more important raison d'etre for its composition: the presentation of a tight brief for substantial reformulation in the structure of evolutionary theory, with all threads of revision conceptually united into an argument of different thrust and form, but still sufficiently con­tinuous with its original Darwinian base to remain within the same intellec­tual lineage and logic.

并非出于自我沉醉或自负，我认为那些捍卫自然界大领域的一般理论的人，有责任向读者解释他们选择这些理论的个人背景和成长历程。因为在如此高的抽象层次上，没有理论能仅仅依靠观察结果的简单逻辑或经验必然性来推导出来。所有的理论承诺，即便在不同的可能性中得到了充分的支持，也会受到作者个人偏好的影响。这些偏好是偶然的，必须被讲述才能被理解。此外，在这种情况下，本书的结构包含了一些独特的特征，如果不加以承认和解释，可能会掩盖其编写的更重要目的：也就是对进化理论结构进行重大重构的论述。这些修改的线索在概念上被整合成一个不同的论点，虽然形式和驱动力各异，但仍然与原始的达尔文理论保持足够的连续性，从而属于同一智力传承和逻辑体系。

Two aspects of my idiosyncratic procedures require explicit commentary here because, at least as my intention, they should reinforce this book's cen­tral argument for coherence (logical, historical and empirical) of the revised and general structure of evolutionary theory, and not further the opposite, al­beit customary, function of such "confessional" writing — namely, to slake authorial egos, fight old battles, and relate twice-told tales to one's own ad­vantage (although I claim no immunity from these all too human foibles).

在这里，我需要明确说明我独特方法中的两个方面，因为它们旨在加强本书关于进化理论修订和整体结构的逻辑性、历史性和经验性连贯性的核心论点。相反，我并不想让这成为一种常见的「自白」写作，借此迎合作者自我、重提旧争议或是将重复的故事对自己有利地再讲一遍。尽管如此，我并不否认自己也可能有这样的弱点。

This book will be published in the Spring of 2002, an auspicious and palindromic year just one step out of the starting gate for a new millennium. At the same time, and fortuitously, my 10th and last volume of monthly es­says in Natural History Magazine, written without a single break from Janu­ary 1974 to January 2001, will also appear in print. In an eerie coincidence (with no meaning that I can discern), my first technical book, Ontogeny and Phylogeny, appeared exactly 25 years before, in 1977, also at the same time as my first book of Natural History essays, Ever Since Darwin. This odd and twofold simultaneous appearance, 25 years apart, of my best youthful efforts in the contrasting (but not really conceptually different) realms of technical and popular science, and then of my best shots from years of greater maturity in the same two realms, has forced me to think long and hard about the meaning of continuity, commitment and personal perspective.

这本书将在 2002 年春天出版，这是一个吉祥的年份，也是新千年的开始。同时，我连续撰写了近三十年的第 10 本也是最后一本《自然历史》杂志随笔集（从 1974 年 1 月到 2001 年 1 月没有中断）也将面世。巧合的是，我的第一本技术书籍《个体发育与系统发育》恰好在 1977 年出版，并且和我第一本《自然历史》随笔集《自达尔文以来》同时问世。这样奇妙的巧合，25 年后又发生了一次，让我不得不认真思考关于连续性、承诺和个人视角的含义。

My popular volumes fall into the explicit and well recognized category of essays, a literary genre defined, ever since Montaigne's initiating 16th century efforts, as the presentation of general material from an explicitly personal and opinionated point of view — although the best essays (literally meaning "attempts," after all) tend to be forthright in their expression of opinions, generous (or at least fair) to other views, and honest in their effort to specify the basis of authorial preferences. On the other hand, technical treatises in science do not generally receive such a license for explicitly personal expres­sion. I believe that this convention in technical writing has been both harmful and more than a bit deceptive. Science, done perforce by ordinary human beings, expressing ordinary motives and foibles of the species, cannot be grasped as an enterprise without some acknowledgment of personal dimen­sions in preferences and decisions — for, although a final product may display logical coherence, other decisions, leading to other formulations of equally tight structure, could have been followed, and we do need to know why an author proceeded as he did if we wish to achieve our best understanding of his accomplishments, including the general worth of his conclusions.

我的一些受欢迎的著作属于明确且公认的散文类别。这种文学体裁，自从 16 世纪由蒙田开创以来，被定义为从个人和主观的角度来呈现材料。尽管散文字面上意为「尝试」，但优秀的散文往往直率地表达观点，对其他观点持宽容（或至少公正）的态度，并诚实地说明作者偏好的基础。相比之下，科学的技术论文通常没有这样明确个人表达的自由。我认为，这种在技术写作中的惯例既有害又有些误导性。科学是由普通人来完成的，表现出他们通常的动机和人性的弱点。如果不承认在偏好和决策中存在的个人因素，就无法全面理解科学这个事业。尽管最终的研究成果可能展现逻辑上的一致性，但也可能有其他决策导致同样严谨的结构。因此，如果我们想深入理解作者的成就，包括他结论的价值，就需要了解作者为何做出这样的选择。

Logical coherence may remain formally separate from ontogenetic con­struction, or psychological origin, but a full understanding of form does re­quire some insight into intention and working procedure. Perhaps some pre­sentations of broad theories in the history of science — Newton's Principia comes immediately to mind — remain virtually free of personal statement (sometimes making them, as in this case, virtually unreadable thereby). But most comprehensive works, in all fields of science, from Galileo's Dialogo to Darwin's Origin, gain stylistic strength and logical power by their suffu­sion with honorable statements about authorial intents, purposes, prejudices, and preferences. I cannot think of a single major book in natural history — from Buffon's Histoire naturelle and Cuvier's Ossemens fossiles to Simpson's Tempo and Mode, and Mayr's Animal Species — that does not include such extensive personal information, either in explicit sections, or inserted by-the-by throughout. (Even so abstract a presentation as R. A. Fisher's Genetical Theory of Natural Selection gains greatly in comprehension through its long and final, if in retrospect regrettable, section on the author's idiosyncratic eugenical views about human improvement.) I have included personal discus­sion throughout this text, but let me also devote a few explicit pages to the two points that I regard as most crucial to understanding the general argu­ment through (or despite) conscious idiosyncrasies in my presentation.

逻辑的连贯性虽然可能与个体发育的形成过程或心理起源保持形式上的分离，但要完全理解其形式，确实需要对作者的意图和工作方法有所了解。在科学史上，有些广泛的理论呈现 —— 例如牛顿的《原理》—— 几乎没有作者的个人陈述（这有时反而使这些作品难以阅读）。然而，许多科学领域的综合性著作，从伽利略的《对话》到达尔文的《物种起源》，常常因为融入了关于作者意图、目的、偏好等的个人陈述而增强了它们的风格和逻辑力量。我很难想象有哪本重要的自然历史书籍没有包含这样的个人信息，无论是以明确的章节形式，还是在书中随意插入。这些书包括布丰的《自然史》、居维叶的《化石骨骼》、辛普森的《速度与模式》以及梅尔的《动物种类》。即便是像 R. A. Fisher 的《自然选择的遗传理论》这种较为抽象的作品，也因为其关于人类改进的独特优生观点的长篇讨论而在理解上得到了很大帮助。本文中，我也贯穿了个人的讨论，接下来我将用几页篇幅明确讨论两个我认为对于理解整体论点至关重要的方面，尽管这些是我在呈现时有意识的独特之处。

History

Many technical treatises in science begin with a short section on previous his­tory of work in the field — usually written in the hagiographical mode to de­pict prior history as a march towards final truths revealed in the current vol­ume. Sometimes, authors get a bit carried away, and these historical sections expand into substantial parts of the final book. Lest anyone make the false in­ference that my full first half of history arose in this haphazard and initially unintended way, I hasten to assure readers that my final result was my inten­tion from the start.

许多科学技术论文在开头会有一个简短部分，介绍该领域的历史工作 —— 通常用理想化的方式，将过去的历史描述为通向当前书中揭示的最终真理的进程。有时，作者可能会稍显过度，这些历史部分就会扩展成整本书的重要内容。为避免有人误以为我在书的前半部分的历史是以随意且最初无意的方式产生的，我要明确向读者保证，这一结果从一开始就是我的初衷。

For several reasons, I always conceived this book as a smooth joining of two halves, roughly equal in length and importance. First, and ontogenetically, I had written my earlier technical book, Ontogeny and Phylogeny, in this admittedly unusual manner — and I remain pleased with both the distinctiveness and the efficacy of the result. Second, I believe that the history of evo­lutionary thought, and probably of any other subject imbued with such im­portance to our lives and to our understanding of nature, constitutes an epic tale of fascinating, and mostly honorable, people engaged in a great struggle to comprehend something very deep and very difficult. Thus, such histories capture a bit of the best in us (also of the worst, but all human endeavors so conspire) — a bit, moreover, that cannot be expressed in any other way. We re­ally do need to honor the temporal substrate of our current understanding, not only as a guide to our continuing efforts, but also as a moral obligation to our forebears.

出于多种原因，我一直将这本书视为两个部分的自然结合，这两个部分在篇幅和重要性上大致相当。首先，从发展的角度来说，我的早期技术著作《个体发生与系统发生》就是以这种不寻常的方式写成的，我对其独特性和效果仍然感到满意。其次，我认为进化思想的历史，以及任何对我们生活和对自然理解有重大影响的主题，都是一部引人入胜的史诗。在这部史诗中，许多值得敬佩的人们为理解一些深奥而复杂的问题而努力。因此，这样的历史展现了我们身上最好的一面（当然也有不足之处，但所有人类的努力都是如此）。我们确实需要尊重我们当前理解的时间背景，这不仅为我们的持续努力提供指导，也是一种对先辈的道德责任。

But a third and practical reason trumps all others. Although I would not state such a claim as a generality for all scientific analyses, in this particular case I do not see how the structure of evolutionary theory can be resolved and the appropriate weights of relative importance assigned to the different com­ponents thereof, absent such a historical perspective. (Would it not be odd to claim, in any case, that the quintessential science for resolving the nature of life's history can itself be understood as a pristine construction, a fully-formed conceptual entity drawn intact from some analog of Zeus's brow, rather than an "organic" structure of ideas with its own ontogeny and history?)

但是，有一个非常现实的理由比其他理由更重要。虽然我不会说这种观点适用于所有的科学分析，但在这个特定的例子中，没有历史视角，我无法理解如何解决进化理论的结构问题，并对其不同组成部分的重要性进行合理的权重分配。（毕竟，声称用于理解生命历史的核心科学可以被视为一个纯粹而完整的构造，如同从宙斯的头脑中完全形成，这难道不奇怪吗？这比喻的是一个自然而然生长并具有自身发展历程的「有机」思想结构。）

To give one example at the largest and at the smallest scales of my argu­ment, I don't know how I could have properly defended my identification and explication of the threefold essence of Darwinian logic without documenting the history of theoretical debate in order to tease out the components that have always been most troubling, most central, and most directive. A pure description of the theory's abstract logic simply will not suffice. To epitomize, I have identified these essential components on three basic grounds: that logic compels (Chapter 2), that history validates (Chapters 3–7), and that current debate reaffirms (Chapters 8–12). The middle term of this epitome unites the end members; I cannot present a coherent or compelling defense without this linkage. The three issues of agency, efficacy and scope build the Darwinian essence both because the logical structure of the theory so dictates, and because the history and current utility of the theory so document.

为了在我论点中展示最大和最小尺度的例子，我必须通过记录理论辩论的历史，来揭示那些一直以来最具争议、最为核心以及最具指导意义的要素，才能有效地解释和捍卫达尔文逻辑的三重本质。仅仅对理论抽象逻辑的描述是不够的。总结来说，我是基于三个基本点来识别这些关键成分的：逻辑的必然性（第二章）、历史的验证（第三到第七章）、以及当前辩论的再次确认（第八到第十二章）。这个总结中的中间环节将前后联系在一起；没有这个纽带，我的辩护将无法连贯或令人信服。代理性、效能和范围这三个问题构成了达尔文的核心要素，既因为理论的逻辑结构如此要求，也因为其历史和当前的实用性得到了证明。

To complement this most general statement with just one example of the utility of historical analysis at the smaller scale of details, I offer the following case as the strongest argument for my central claim that Darwin's brave at­tempt to construct a single-level, exclusively organismic theory of natural se­lection must fail in principle, and that all selectionists must eventually own a hierarchical model. What better evidence can we cite than the historical dem­onstration (see Chapters 3 and 5 for details) that each of the only three foundational thinkers who truly understood the logic of selectionism — August Weismann, Hugo de Vries, and Charles Darwin himself — tried mightily to make the single-level version work as a fully sufficient explanation for evolu­tion. And each failed, after intense intellectual struggle, and for fascinatingly different reasons documented later in the book — Darwin for explaining di­versity by reluctant resort to species selection; Weismann for a strongest ini­tial commitment to a single level, and an eventual recognition of full hierar­chy as the most important and distinctive conclusion of his later career (by his own judgment); and de Vries for reconciling his largely psychological fealty to Darwin as his intellectual hero, with his clearly non-Darwinian account of the origin of species and the explanation of trends (including an explicit coin­ing of the term "species selection" for explaining cladal patterns).

为了举例说明历史分析在更细节层面上的重要性，我提供以下案例来支持我的中心论点：达尔文尝试建立一个仅依靠单层次个体生物的自然选择理论，这在原则上是行不通的，所有的选择论者最终都需要接受一个多层级的模型。最有力的证据是，历史上有三位真正理解选择论逻辑的思想家 —— August Weismann、Hugo de Vries 和 Charles Darwin —— 都曾努力尝试用单层次理论来完整解释进化。结果，他们都未能成功，尽管他们进行了深入的思考，且每个人失败的原因都各不相同（详见本书的第 3 章和第 5 章）。达尔文因为不得不依赖物种选择来解释生物多样性而感到无奈；Weismann 则从最初坚定的单层次信念，到后来认识到多层级体系才是他职业生涯中最重要的结论；而 de Vries 则在心理上敬仰达尔文为智识英雄，却在物种起源和发展趋势的解释上，发展出明显不同于达尔文的观点，并首次提出「物种选择」这一术语来解释生物分类模式。

One might cite various truisms telling us that people ignorant of history will be condemned to repeat its errors. But I would rather re-express this ac­curate and rueful observation in a more positive manner by illustrating the power of historical analysis to aid both our current understanding and the depth of our appreciation for the intellectual importance of our enterprise. Finally, and to loosen the rein on personal bravado that I usually try to hold at least somewhat in check, no scholar should impose a project of this length upon his colleagues unless he believes that some quirk of special skill or expe­rience permits him to proceed in a unique manner that may offer some insight to others. In my case, and only by history's fortune of no immediate competi­tion in a small field, I may be able to combine two areas of professional com­petence not otherwise conjoined among current evolutionists. I am not a credentialed historian of science, but I believe that I have done sufficient work in this field (with sufficient understanding of the difference between the Whiggish dilettantism of most enthusiastic amateurs, and the rigorous meth­ods applied by serious scholars) to qualify as adequately knowledgeable. (At least I can read all the major works in their original languages, and I stay close to the "internalist" style of analysis that people who understand the logic and history of theories, but cannot claim truly professional expertise in the "externalist" factors of general social and historical context, can usefully pursue.) Meanwhile I am, for my sins, a lifelong and active professional pale­ontologist, a commitment that began at age five as love at first sight with a di­nosaur skeleton.

有人可能会引用一些常见的说法，指出对历史的无知会导致重蹈覆辙。然而，我更愿意用一种积极的方式来表达这一观点，通过展示历史分析的力量来提升我们当前的理解和对我们事业的智力重要性的欣赏。最后，尽管我通常尽量克制自己的自负，但我认为，除非一个学者相信自己拥有独特的技能或经验，否则不应将如此庞大的项目强加给同事。我的情况是，由于领域小而没有直接竞争，我可能能够结合当前进化论者中未曾结合的两个专业领域。我并不是一位认证的科学史学家，但我相信自己在这一领域做了足够的研究，并且理解业余爱好者的肤浅与严肃学者的严格方法之间的区别。（至少我能阅读所有主要作品的原文，并且我倾向于使用「内在主义」分析风格，这适合那些理解理论逻辑和历史，但在社会和历史背景的「外在主义」因素上不具备专业知识的人。）同时，我是一位终身从事专业古生物学研究的人，这种热爱可以追溯到我五岁时对恐龙骨架的一见钟情。

Many historians possess deeper knowledge and understanding of their immediate subject than I could ever hope to acquire, but none enjoy enough intimacy with the world of science (knowing its norms in their bones, and its quirks and foibles in their daily experience) to link this expertise to contem­porary debates about causes of evolution. Many more scientists hold superb credentials as participants in current debates, but do not know the historical background. As I hope I demonstrated by practical utility in The Mismeasure of Man (Gould, 1981a), a small and particular — but I think quite impor­tant — intellectual space exists, almost entirely unoccupied, for people who can use historical knowledge to enlighten (not merely to footnote or to pret­tify) current scientific debates, and who can then apply a professional's "feel" for the doing of science to grasp the technical complexities of past debates in a useful manner inaccessible to historians (who have therefore misinter­preted, in significant ways, some important incidents and trends in their sub­ject). I only hope that I have not been wrong in believing that my devotion of a lifetime's enthusiasm to both pursuits might make my efforts useful, in a distinctive way, to my colleagues.

许多历史学家对他们所研究的具体课题有着深厚的知识和理解，但很少有人对科学领域有深入的接触。也就是在日常生活中，没有人能真正了解科学的规范、特点和弱点，因此难以将这种专业知识与当代有关进化原因的辩论结合起来。另一方面，许多科学家在当前的辩论中拥有卓越的资历，但他们对历史背景知之甚少。正如我在《人的误测》（Gould，1981a）中所展示的那样，我认为有一个几乎无人涉足但非常重要的领域：利用历史知识来启发当前的科学辩论，而不仅仅是做注释或装饰。通过这种方式，可以用一种历史学家难以达到的方式，理解过去辩论中的技术复杂性，因为历史学家可能会在一些重要事件和趋势上产生误解。我希望自己在这两个领域的终生努力，能够以独特的方式为我的同事们提供帮助。

Theory

理论

I admire my friend Oliver Sacks extravagantly as a writer, and I could never hope to match him in general quality or human compassion. He once said something that touched me deeply, despite my continuing firm disagreement with his claim (while acknowledging the validity of the single statement rele­vant to the present context). Oliver said that he envied me because, although we had both staked out a large and generous subject for our writing (he on the human mind, me on evolution), I had enjoyed the privilege of devising and developing a general theory that allowed me to coordinate all my work into a coherent and distinctive body, whereas he had only written descrip­tively and aimlessly, albeit with some insight, because no similar central focus underlay his work. I replied that he had surely sold himself short, because he had been beguiled by conventional views about the nature and limits of what may legitimately be called a central scientific theory — and that he certainly held such an organizing concept in his attempt to reintroduce the venerable "case study method" of attention to irreducible peculiarities of individual pa­tients in the practice of cure and healing in medicine. Thus, I argued, he held a central theory about the importance of individuality and contingency in gen­eral medical theory, just as I and others had stressed the centrality of histori­cal contingency in any theoretical analysis and understanding of evolution and its actual results.

我对朋友 Oliver Sacks 的写作才华赞赏有加，人性关怀和写作质量方面我自愧不如。他曾说过一句令我感动的话，尽管我并不完全同意他的观点（但承认在当前背景下的相关性）。Oliver 说他羡慕我，因为我们都选择了一个宏大的主题进行写作（他研究人类心灵，我研究进化），而我有幸能够创建和发展一种理论，把我的所有工作整合成一个连贯而独特的体系。他则认为自己只是凭借洞察力进行描述性的写作，没有类似的核心理论支撑。我告诉他，他低估了自己，因为他被传统观念限制住了，认为只有某种形式的科学理论才能被称为中心理论。而实际上，他在尝试重新引入古老的「案例研究法」时，已经形成了一种理论，强调个别患者在医学中不可忽视的独特性。因此，他的工作实际上是围绕个性和偶然性的重要性展开的，就像我们在进化理论中强调历史偶然性的重要性一样。

Oliver saw the theory of punctuated equilibrium itself, which I developed with Niles Eldredge and discuss at inordinate length in Chapter 9, as my coordinating centerpiece, and I would not deny this statement. But punctuated equilibrium stands for a larger and coherent set of mostly iconoclastic con­cerns, and I must present some intellectual autobiography to explain the rea­sons and the comings together, as best I understand them myself — hence my rip-off of Cardinal Newman's famous title for the best similar effort ever made, albeit in a maximally different domain. In his Apologia Pro Vita Sua (an apology for one's own life), Newman intends the operative word as I do, in its original and positive meaning, not in the currently more popular nega­tive sense — "something said or written in defense or justification of what ap­pears to others to be wrong or of what may be liable to disapprobation" (per Webster's).

Oliver 将我与 Niles Eldredge 共同提出并在第 9 章中详细讨论的间断平衡理论视为我的核心理论。对此我并不否认。然而，间断平衡不仅仅是一个理论，它代表了一系列更为广泛且多为反传统的思考方式。为了更好地解释这些思考及其形成过程，我需要提供一些个人的学术背景。因此，我借用了 Cardinal Newman 的著名标题，尽管这是在完全不同的领域。Newman 在《Apologia Pro Vita Sua》（为自己的生活辩护）中使用的「辩护」一词，其原意是正面的，而不是如今常见的负面含义，即「为那些看似错误或可能遭受批评的事物进行辩护或辩解」。这个解释摘自韦氏词典。

As my first two scientific commitments, I fell in love with paleontology when I met Tyrannosaurus in the Museum of Natural History at age five, and with evolution at age 11, when I read G. G. Simpson's The Meaning of Evolu­tion, with great excitement but minimal comprehension, after my parents, as members of a book club for folks with intellectual interests but little eco­nomic opportunity or formal credentials, forgot to send back the "we don't want anything this month" card, and received the book they would never have ordered (but that I begged them to keep because I saw the little stick fig­ures of dinosaurs on the dust jacket). Thus, from day one, my developing pro­fessional interests united paleontology and evolution. For some reason still unclear to me, I always found the theory of how evolution works more fasci­nating than the realized pageant of its paleontological results, and my major interest therefore always focused upon principles of macroevolution.* I did come to understand the vague feelings of dissatisfaction (despite Simpson's attempt to resolve them in an orthodox way by incorporating paleontology within the Modern Synthesis) that some paleontologists have always felt with the Darwinian premise that microevolutionary mechanics could construct their entire show just by accumulating incremental results through geological immensity.

在我最初的两个科学兴趣中，五岁时我在自然历史博物馆看到暴龙后，便爱上了古生物学；而在 11 岁时，我阅读了 G. G. Simpson 的《进化的意义》，虽然理解有限，却充满了兴奋。我的父母是一个为有智力兴趣但经济条件有限的人们设立的读书俱乐部的成员，因为忘记退回「不想要本月书籍」的卡片，意外收到这本他们原本不会订购的书（但因为封面上有小恐龙图案，我请求他们留下这本书）。因此，从一开始，我的专业兴趣就结合了古生物学和进化论。不知为何，我一直对进化如何运作的理论比其古生物学结果更感兴趣，因此主要关注宏观进化的原则。我开始理解一些古生物学家对达尔文理论的不满，即仅通过微观进化机制的增量积累来解释整个地质演化过程，尽管 Simpson 试图通过将古生物学纳入现代综合理论来解决这些问题。

As I began my professional preparation for a career in paleontology, this vague dissatisfaction coagulated into two operational foci of discontent. First (and with Niles Eldredge, for we worried this subject virtually to death as graduate students), I became deeply troubled by the Darwinian convention that attributed all non-gradualistic literal appearances to imperfections of the geological record. This traditional argument contained no logical holes, but the practical consequences struck me as unacceptable (especially at the out­set of a career, full of enthusiasm for empirical work, and trained in statis­tical techniques that would permit the discernment of small evolutionary changes). For, by the conventional rationale, the study of microevolution be­came virtually nonoperational in paleontology — as one almost never found this anticipated form of gradual change up geological sections, and one there­fore had to interpret the vastly predominant signal of stasis and geologically abrupt appearance as a sign of the record's imperfection, and therefore as no empirical guide to the nature of evolution. Second, I became increasingly dis­turbed that, at the higher level of evolutionary trends within clades, the ma­jority of well documented examples (reduction of stipe number in graptolites, increasing symmetry of crinoidal cups, growing complexity of ammonoid su­tures, for example) had never been adequately explained in the terms de­manded by Darwinian convention — that is, as adaptive improvements of constituent organisms in anagenetic sequences. Most so-called explana­tions amounted to little more than what Lewontin and I, following Kipling, would later call "just-so stories," or plausible claims without tested evidence, whereas other prominent trends couldn't even generate a plausible story in adaptationist terms at all.

在我开始为古生物学的职业生涯做准备时，我的模糊不满逐渐凝聚成了两个具体的困扰。首先（与 Niles Eldredge 一同探讨过，因为在研究生期间我们几乎把这个问题讨论到极致），我对达尔文主义的传统观念深感不安，即认为所有非渐进性变化都是由于地质记录的不完整造成的。虽然这一传统论点在逻辑上无懈可击，但其实际后果让我难以接受（尤其是在职业生涯开始时，我对实证研究充满热情，并接受过统计技术训练以识别微小的进化变化）。因为根据传统的解释，微观进化的研究在古生物学中几乎无法进行 —— 由于在地质层中几乎找不到这种预期的渐进变化，因此必须将大多数停滞和地质突现现象解释为记录的缺陷，从而无法作为理解进化本质的实证依据。其次，我越来越困扰的是，在更高层次的谱系进化趋势上，许多有据可查的例子（如笔石柄数的减少、海百合杯的对称性增加、菊石缝合线的复杂性增加）从未被充分解释为达尔文主义所要求的那种适应性进步 —— 即作为变异序列中生物体的适应性改进。许多所谓的解释只是我们后来受 Kipling 启发，与 Lewontin 一起称为「随便说说的故事」，即未经验证的合理说法，而其他显著趋势甚至无法在适应主义的框架下提出合理的解释。

As Eldredge and I devised punctuated equilibrium, I did use the theory to resolve these two puzzles to my satisfaction, and each resolution, when finally generalized and further developed, led to my two major critiques of the first two branches of the essential triad of Darwinian central logic — so Oliver Sacks's identification of punctuated equilibrium as central to my theoretical world holds, although more as a starting point than as a coordinating focus. By accepting the geologically abrupt appearance and subsequent extended stasis of species as a fair description of an evolutionary reality, and not only as a sign of the poverty of paleontological data, we soon recognized that spe­cies met all criteria for definition and operation as genuine Darwinian indi­viduals in the higher-level domain of macroevolution — and this insight (by complex routes discussed in Chapter 9) led us to concepts of species selection in particular and, eventually, to the full hierarchical model of selection as an interesting theoretical challenge and contrast to Darwinian convictions about the exclusivity of organismal selection. In this way, punctuated equilibrium led to the reformulation proposed herein for the first branch of essential Dar­winian logic.

在 Eldredge 和我共同提出间断平衡理论时，我确实用这一理论解决了两个难题，并对解决方案感到满意。这些解决方案在被概括和发展后，导致了我对达尔文中心逻辑基本三元组的前两个分支提出重要批评。因此，Oliver Sacks 所说的间断平衡是我理论世界的核心是正确的，尽管它更像是一个起点而非核心焦点。

我们接受了物种在地质历史中突然出现并长期停滞的现象，认为这是一种进化现实的合理描述，而不仅仅是古生物学数据不足的体现。通过这一认识，我们发现物种完全具备成为宏观进化中真正达尔文个体的标准。这一见解，通过第 9 章中讨论的复杂路径，特别引出了物种选择的概念，并最终发展成为完整的选择层级模型。这对达尔文关于生物体选择的独特性信念提出了有趣的理论挑战。

间断平衡因此促成了我们对达尔文基本逻辑第一个分支的重新表述。

Meanwhile, in trying to understand the nature of stasis, we initially fo­cused (largely in error, I now believe) upon internal constraints, as vaguely represented by various concepts of "homeostasis," and as exemplified in the model of Galton's polyhedron (see Chapter 4). These thoughts led me to extend my doubts about adaptation and the sufficiency of functionalist mechanisms in general — especially in conjunction with my old worries about paleontological failures to explain cladal trends along traditional adapta­tionist lines. Thus, these aspects of punctuated equilibrium strongly contrib­uted to my developing critiques of adaptationism and purely functional me­chanics on the second branch of essential Darwinian logic (although other arguments struck me as even more important, as discussed below).

与此同时，在试图理解停滞的本质时，我们最初将注意力放在了内部约束上（我现在认为这是一个很大的错误）。这些约束模糊地表现为「稳态」的各种概念，并在 Galton 的多面体模型中得到了体现（参见第 4 章）。这些思考让我对适应性和功能主义机制是否足够产生了怀疑，特别是结合我之前对古生物学未能按照传统适应主义路线解释类群趋势的担忧。因此，这些关于间断平衡的观点极大地推动了我对适应主义和单纯功能机制的批评（尽管在我看来，还有其他更重要的论点，如下所述）。

Nonetheless, and despite the centrality of punctuated equilibrium in developing a broader critique of conventional Darwinism, my sources extended outward into a diverse and quirky network of concerns that seemed, to me and at first, isolated and uncoordinated, and that only later congealed into a coherent critique. For this curious, almost paradoxical, reason, I have be­come even more convinced that the elements of my overall critique hang to­gether, for I never sensed the connections when I initially identified the com­ponents as, individually, the most challenging and intriguing items I had encountered in my study of evolution. When one accumulates a set of things only for their independent appeals, with no inkling that any common intellec­tual ground underlies the apparent miscellany, then one can only gain con­fidence in the "reality" of a conceptual basis discerned only later for the cohe­sion. I would never argue that this critique of strict Darwinism gains any higher probability of truth value for initially infecting me in such an uncoor­dinated and mindless way. But I would assert that a genuinely coherent and general alternative formulation must exist "out there" in the philosophical universe of intellectual possibilities — whatever its empirical validity — if its isolated components could coagulate, and be discerned and selected, so un­consciously.

尽管断续平衡理论在批判传统达尔文主义中占据中心位置，但我获取资料的过程却涉及到一个多样化且看似杂乱无章的主题网络。起初，这些主题在我看来是孤立且无序的，只有在后来才逐渐形成一个连贯的批判体系。正是由于这种奇特甚至是矛盾的原因，我更加相信我批判中的各个元素是相互关联的，因为当我最初把它们识别为我在进化研究中遇到的最具挑战性和吸引力的项目时，并没有意识到它们之间的联系。当一个人仅仅因为这些事物各自独立的吸引力而进行收集，而没有察觉到其背后可能存在的共同智力基础时，只有在后来发现这些事物内在的连贯性时，才能对这种概念基础的「真实性」产生信心。我并不认为这种对严格达尔文主义的批判因为最初以无序和无意识的方式影响了我而更接近真实。但我会认为，在哲学可能性的智力世界中，必然存在一种真正连贯且普遍的替代理论 —— 无论其经验有效性如何 —— 如果它的孤立元素能够在无意识中自发地凝聚并被识别和选择。

If I may make a somewhat far-fetched analogy to my favorite Victorian novel, Daniel Deronda (the last effort of Darwin's friend George Eliot), the hero of this story, a Jew raised in a Christian family with no knowledge of his ethnic origins, becomes, as an adult, drawn to a set of apparently inde­pendent activities with no coordinating theme beyond their relationship, en­tirely unknown to Deronda at the time of his initial fascination, to Jewish history and customs. Eventually, he recognizes the unifying theme behind such apparent diversity, and learns the truth of his own genetic background. (I forgive Eliot for this basically silly fable of genealogical determinism be­cause her philosemitic motives, however naive and a bit condescending, shine forth so clearly in the surrounding antisemitic darkness of her times.) But I do feel, to complete the analogy, rather like a modern, if only culturally or psy­chologically predisposed, Deronda who gathered the elements of a coherent critique solely because he loved each item individually — and only later sensed an underlying unity, which therefore cannot be chimaerical, but may claim some logical existence prior to any conscious formulation on my part.

如果我可以把我最喜欢的维多利亚时代小说《丹尼尔·德隆达》作为一个有些牵强的类比，这部小说是达尔文的朋友乔治·艾略特的最后一部作品。故事的主人公是一位犹太人，他在一个完全不知道自己种族背景的基督教家庭中长大。成年后，他对一系列看似独立的活动产生了兴趣，而这些活动除了与犹太历史和习俗的关系外，没有其他协调主题。在他最初被吸引时，这些关系对德隆达来说是完全未知的。最终，他意识到这些多样化活动背后的统一主题，并了解了自己基因背景的真相。（我原谅艾略特这个基本上荒谬的家族决定论寓言，因为她的亲犹太动机，尽管显得幼稚且有些居高临下，却在她那个时代反犹太的黑暗中如此清晰地闪耀着。）为了完成这个类比，我确实感到自己更像一个现代的，仅仅是在文化或心理上倾向的德隆达，只因为热爱每一个独立的项目而集结了一个连贯批评的要素 —— 而且只是后来才感受到其中的潜在统一性，因此这种统一性并非虚构，而是在我意识到之前就已经存在某种逻辑上的联系。

In fact, the case for an external and objective coherence of this alternative view of evolution seems even stronger to me because I gathered the indepen­dent items not only in ignorance of their coordination, but also at a time when I held a conscious and conventional view of Darwinian evolution that would have actively denied their critical unity and meaning. I fledged in sci­ence as a firm adaptationist, utterly beguiled by the absolutist beauty (no doubt, my own simplistic reading of a more subtle, albeit truly hardened, Modern Synthesis) of asserting, a la Cain and other ecological geneticists of the British school, that all aspects of organismal phenotypes, even the most trivial nuances, could be fully explained as adaptations built by natural selec­tion.

事实上，我认为这种对进化的另类观点在外部和客观上更具一致性。这是因为我在不知情的情况下收集了这些独立的证据，当时我还持有传统的达尔文进化论，这种观念会主动否认这些证据的关键统一性和意义。在科学领域，我起初是一个坚定的适应主义者，完全被一种绝对的美感所吸引。这种美感源自我对现代综合理论的简单理解，类似于 Cain 和其他英国生态遗传学家的观点，他们认为生物体的所有特征，甚至是最微小的差异，都可以被视为自然选择的结果。






I remember two incidents of juvenilia with profound embarrassment to­day: First, an undergraduate evening bull session with the smartest physics major at Antioch College, as his skepticism evoked my stronger insistence that our science matched his in reductionistic rigor because "we" now knew for certain that natural selection built everything for optimal advantage, thus making evolution as quantifiable and predictive as classical physics. Second, as a somewhat more sophisticated, but still beguiled, assistant professor, I re­member my profound feeling of sadness and disappointment, nearly amount­ing to an emotional sense of betrayal, upon learning that an anthropological colleague favored drift as the probable reason for apparently trivial genetic differences among isolated groups of Papua-New Guinea peoples. I remem­ber remonstrating with him as follows: Of course your argument conforms to logic and empirical possibility, and I admit that we have no proof either way. But your results are also consistent with selection — and our panselectionist paradigm has forged a theory of such beauty and elegant simplicity that one should never favor exceptions for their mere plausibility, but only for docu­mented necessity. (I recall this discussion with special force because my emo­tional feelings were so strong, and my disappointment in his "unnecessary apostasy" so keen, even though I knew that neither of us had the empirical "goods.") Finally, if I could, in a species of Devil's bargain, wipe any of my publications off the face of the earth and out of all memory, I would gladly nominate my unfortunately rather popular review article on "Evolutionary paleontology and the science of form" (Gould, 1970a) — a ringing paean to selectionist absolutism, buttressed by the literary barbarism that a "quantifunctional" paleontology, combining the best of biometric and mechanical analyses, could prove panadaptationism even for fossils that could not be run through the hoops of actual experiments.

我至今仍对年轻时的两次鲁莽行为感到深深的尴尬：第一次是在安提阿克学院的一次夜间讨论会上，与最聪明的物理专业学生交流。当时他的怀疑激起了我更强烈的坚持，我认为我们的科学在还原论的严谨性上可以与他的匹敌，因为「我们」坚信自然选择是为了获得最佳优势而构建的，这使得进化可以像经典物理学一样被量化和预测。第二次是当我作为一个稍微成熟但依旧容易被迷惑的助理教授时，得知一位人类学同事认为基因漂变（drift）是巴布亚新几内亚孤立群体中微小遗传差异的可能原因时，我感到深深的悲伤和失望，几乎有一种被背叛的情感。我记得我曾这样反驳他：你的论点确实符合逻辑和经验上的可能性，我承认我们没有确凿的证据支持任何一方。但是，你的结果也可能与自然选择一致 —— 我们所坚持的泛选择论范式已经形成了一个美丽而简单的理论体系，不应仅仅因为其可能性而偏向例外，除非有确凿的必要证据。我对这次讨论印象深刻，因为我情感上非常强烈，对他所谓的「多余的离经叛道」感到失望，尽管我知道我们都没有确凿的「证据」。最后，如果可以选择，我愿意通过某种「魔鬼的交易」将我任何一篇出版物从地球上抹去，以及从所有记忆中消除，我会毫不犹豫地提名我那篇不幸相当受欢迎的评论文章《进化古生物学与形式科学》（Gould，1970a）—— 这是一篇对选择论绝对主义的热情颂歌，支持着一种「数量功能」古生物学的文学表达，结合了最佳的生物统计和机械分析，甚至可以证明那些无法通过实验考验的化石的泛适应主义。

Against this orthodox background — or, rather, within it and quite unconsciously for many years — I worked piecemeal, producing a set of separate and continually accreting revisionary items along each of the branches of Darwinian central logic, until I realized that a "Platonic" something "up there" in ideological space could coordinate all these critiques and fascinations into a revised general theory with a retained Darwinian base.

在这样的正统背景中，或者更确切地说，在多年未曾意识到的情况下，我逐步进行零星的研究，沿着达尔文逻辑的各个分支，逐渐形成了一系列独立而不断增加的修正项目。直到我意识到，在理论上有一个「柏拉图式」的概念可以将所有这些批评和兴趣整合为一个基于达尔文理论的修订版普遍理论。

The first branch of levels in selection proceeded rather directly and linearly because the generality flowed so clearly from punctuated equilibrium itself, once Eldredge and I finally worked through the implications and extensions of our own formulations (Eldredge and Gould, 1972). Steve Stanley (1975) and Elisabeth Vrba (1980) helped to show us what we had missed in rami­fications leading from the phenomenology of stasis and geologically abrupt appearance, to recognizing species as genuine Darwinian individuals, to des­ignating species as, therefore and potentially, the basic individuals of macro-evolution (comparable with the role of the organism in microevolution), to the validity of species selection, and eventually to the full hierarchical model and its profound departure from the exclusively organismal accounts of con­ventional Darwinism (or the even more reduced and equally monistic genic versions of Williams and Dawkins) — see Vrba and Gould, 1986. Finally, by adopting the interactor rather than the replicator approach to defining selec­tion, and by recognizing emergent fitness, rather than emergent characters, as the proper criterion for identifying higher-level selection (Lloyd and Gould, 1993; Gould and Lloyd, 1999), I think that we finally reached, by a circuitous route around many stumbling blocks of my previous stupidity, a consistent and truly operational theory of hierarchical selection (see Chapter 8).

选择过程的第一个层次相对简单明了，这是因为一旦 Eldredge 和我解决了我们自己提出的标点平衡理论的含义和扩展，其普遍性就显现得非常清晰（Eldredge 和 Gould，1972）。Steve Stanley（1975）和 Elisabeth Vrba（1980）帮助我们认识到，从物种在地质学上突然出现和长期稳定的现象学，到把物种视为真正的达尔文个体，这是一个重要的转变。这使我们能够将物种视为宏观进化中的基本单位，就像微观进化中生物体的角色一样，并验证了物种选择的有效性。最终，这引导我们形成了一个完整的层次模型，这与传统的达尔文主义（或 Williams 和 Dawkins 的单一基因版本）中仅以生物体为中心的观点有着深刻的区别（见 Vrba 和 Gould，1986）。最后，通过采用「相互作用者」而非「复制者」的方法来定义选择，并将新出现的适应性作为识别高级别选择的标准（Lloyd 和 Gould，1993；Gould 和 Lloyd，1999），我认为我们最终通过克服许多先前的障碍，达到了一个一致且真正可行的层次选择理论（见第 8 章）。

I must also confess to some preconditioning beyond punctuated equilib­rium. I had admired Wynne-Edwards's pluck (1962) from the start, even though I agreed with Williams's (1966) trenchant criticisms of his particular defenses for group selection, rooted in the ability of populations to regulate their own numbers in the interests of group advantage. Still, I felt, for no rea­son beyond vague intuition, that group selection made logical sense and might well find other domains and formulations of greater validity — a feeling that has now been cashed out by modern reformulations of evolutionary the­ory (see especially Wilson and Sober, 1998, and Chapters 8 and 9 herein).

我必须承认，除了「间断平衡」理论之外，我还有一些先入为主的看法。从一开始，我就很钦佩 Wynne-Edwards 的勇气（1962），尽管我同意 Williams（1966）对他的群体选择理论的尖锐批评。Wynne-Edwards 的理论认为，种群可以为了群体的利益而调节自身的数量。尽管如此，我凭借一种模糊的直觉，认为群体选择在逻辑上是有道理的，并且可能会在其他领域和理论形式中显示出更大的有效性。现代进化理论的重新表述已经验证了这种感觉（特别参见 Wilson 和 Sober，1998，以及本文的第 8 和第 9 章）。

My odyssey on the second branch of balancing internal constraint with external adaptation in understanding the patterning and creative population of novel places in evolutionary morphospace followed a much more com­plex, meandering and diverse set of pathways. As an undergraduate, I loved D'Arcy Thompson's Growth and Form (1917; see Gould, 1971b, for my first "literary" paper), and wrote a senior thesis on his theory of morphology. But I thought that I admired the book only for its incomparable prose, and I at­tacked the anti-Darwinian (and structuralist) components of his theory un­mercifully. I then took up allometry for my first empirical studies, somehow fascinated by structural constraint and correlation of growth, but thinking all the while that my task must center on a restoration of adaptationist themes to this "holdout" bastion of formalist thought — particularly the achievement of biomechanical optima consistent with the Galilean principle of decreasing surface/volume ratios with increasing size in isometric forms. I remain proud of my first review article, dedicated to this subject (Gould, 1966), written when I was still a graduate student, but I am now embarrassed by the fervor of my adaptationist convictions.

我在探索如何在进化形态空间中理解新环境的模式和创造性种群时，经历了一段复杂而多样的旅程。大学期间，我非常喜欢 D'Arcy Thompson 的《成长与形式》（1917；见 Gould，1971b，这是我最初的「文学」论文之一），并在此基础上完成了一篇关于他形态学理论的毕业论文。当时我认为自己只是欣赏这本书的文采，因此对其中反达尔文主义和结构主义的观点进行了严厉批判。接下来，我对异速生长的研究产生了兴趣，这种研究涉及结构约束和生长的相关性，虽然我一直认为自己的任务是将适应论的主题重新引入到这种形式主义的理论中，尤其是实现与伽利略关于等距形式中尺寸增大时表面 / 体积比减少的原则相一致的生物力学最佳状态。我至今仍为自己在研究生时期撰写的关于这一主题的评论文章（Gould，1966）感到自豪，但现在回想起来，对自己当时对适应论的坚定信念感到有些尴尬。

I emphasized allometric analysis, now in a directly multivariate reformulation, in my first set of empirical studies on the Bermudian pulmonate snail Poecilozonites (see especially Gould, 1969 — the published version of my Ph.D. dissertation). And yet, of all the long and largely adaptationist treatises in this series, and for some reason that I could not identify at the time, the conclusion that I reached with most satisfaction, and that I somehow re­garded as most theoretically innovative (without knowing why), resided in a short, and otherwise insignificant, article that I wrote for a specialized pale-ontological journal on a case of convergence produced by structural necessity, given modes of coiling and allometry in this genus, rather than by selectionist honing (for some cases rested upon ecophenotypic expression, others on paedomorphosis, and still others on gradual change that could be read as conventionally adaptive): "Precise but fortuitous convergence in Pleistocene land snails" (Gould, 1971c).

在我对百慕大陆生肺螺 Poecilozonites 的第一组实证研究中，我强调了异速生长分析，并采用了一种新的多变量分析方法（详见 Gould，1969—— 这是我博士论文的出版版本）。然而，在这一系列主要以适应论为主的冗长论文中，有一个让我感到特别满意的结论。出于某种当时我无法识别的原因，我认为这一结论最具理论创新性。这个结论发表在一篇我为古生物学专刊撰写的文章中，这篇文章简短且在其他方面似乎无足轻重。文章讨论了一种由于结构上的必然性而产生的趋同现象，这种现象是由这个属的螺旋方式和异速生长导致的，而不是通过选择论的作用（因为有些案例是生态表型表达，另一些是幼态持续，还有一些是可以解读为传统适应的渐变）：这就是「更新世陆地蜗牛中的精确但偶然的趋同」（Gould，1971c）。

Five disparate reasons underlie my more explicit recognition, during the 1970's and early 1980's, of the importance and theoretical interest (and iconoclasm versus Darwinian traditions) of nonadaptationist themes rooted in structural and historical constraint. First, I stood under the dome of San Marco during a meeting in Venice and then wrote a notorious paper with Dick Lewontin on the subject of spandrels, or nonadaptive sequelae of prior structural decisions (Gould and Lewontin, 1979 — see Chapter 11, pp. 1246–1258). Second, I recognized, with Elisabeth Vrba, that the lexicon of evolu­tionary biology possessed no term for the evidently important phenomenon of structures coopted for utility from different sources of origin (including nonadaptive spandrels), and not directly built as adaptations for their cur­rent function. We therefore devised the term "exaptation" (Gould and Vrba, 1982) and explored its implications for structuralist revisions to pure Dar­winian functionalism. Third, I worked with a group of paleontological colleagues (Raup et al, 1973; Raup and Gould, 1974; Gould et al., 1977) to develop more rigorous criteria for identifying the signals that required selec­tionist, rather than stochastic, explanation of apparent order in phyletic pat­terns. This work left me humbled by the insight that our brains seek pattern, while our cultures favor particular kinds of stories for explaining these pat­terns — thus imposing a powerful bias for ascribing conventional determinis­tic causes, particularly adaptationist scenarios in our Darwinian traditions, to patterns well within the range of expected outcomes in purely stochastic sys­tems. This work sobered me against such a priori preferences for adaptation­ist solutions, so often based upon plausible stories about results, rather than rigorous documentation of mechanisms.

在 20 世纪 70 年代和 80 年代初，我更加清晰地认识到非适应性主题的重要性及其理论趣味，这与达尔文传统相对立，并根植于结构和历史的制约因素。这种认识源于五个不同的原因。首先，在一次威尼斯会议期间，我站在圣马可大教堂的穹顶下，之后与 Dick Lewontin 合写了一篇广为人知的论文，讨论建筑结构中的「拱肩」现象，即先前结构决策的非适应性结果（Gould and Lewontin，1979 — 见第 11 章，第 1246-1258 页）。其次，我与 Elisabeth Vrba 发现，进化生物学中缺乏一个术语来描述一种重要现象：某些结构被从不同来源（包括非适应性拱肩）借用来发挥功能，而不是直接为其当前功能而设计。因此，我们创造了「exaptation」（借用适应）这个术语（Gould and Vrba，1982），并探讨其对单纯达尔文功能主义的结构主义修正的影响。第三，我与一组古生物学同事合作（Raup et al，1973; Raup and Gould，1974; Gould et al.，1977），制定了更严格的标准，以识别哪些表观顺序需要选择性解释，而非随机过程解释。这项工作让我意识到，我们的大脑天然倾向于寻找模式，而我们的文化则偏向于用特定的故事来解释这些模式 —— 这导致我们倾向于将常规的决定性原因，尤其是我们在达尔文传统中习惯的适应性情景，归因于其实可能只是随机系统中预期结果的现象。这项工作让我警觉到，仅仅基于合理的故事而非严格证据的适应性解释的潜在偏见。

Fourth, and most importantly, I read the great European structuralist literatures in writing my book on Ontogeny and Phylogeny (Gould, 1977b). I don't see how anyone could read, from Goethe and Geoffroy down through Severtzov, Remane and Riedl, without developing some appreciation for the plausibility, or at least for the sheer intellectual power, of morphological ex­planations outside the domain of Darwinian functionalism — although my resulting book, for the last time in my career, stuck closely to selectionist or­thodoxy, while describing these alternatives in an accurate and sympathetic manner. Fifth, my growing unhappiness with the speculative character of many adaptationist scenarios increased when, starting in the mid 1970's, the growing vernacular (and some of the technical) literature on sociobiology touted conclusions that struck me as implausible, and that also (in some cases) ran counter to my political and social beliefs as well.

第四，最重要的是，我在撰写《个体发生与系统发生》（Ontogeny and Phylogeny）一书时，阅读了伟大的欧洲结构主义著作（Gould，1977b）。我很难想象，有人能读过从歌德（Goethe）和杰弗罗伊（Geoffroy）到塞沃尔佐夫（Severtzov)、雷曼（Remane）和里德尔（Riedl）的作品后，不对超越达尔文功能主义的形态学解释的合理性，或至少是其智力上的魅力，产生一些欣赏之情。尽管如此，我最终的这本书在我职业生涯中最后一次紧密依附于选择论的正统学说，但仍准确而同情地描述了这些替代方案。第五，自 1970 年代中期开始，随着社会生物学的流行文献（以及一些技术文献）的增多，这些文献中一些结论让我觉得难以置信，并且（在某些情况下）也与我的政治和社会信仰相悖，我对许多适应论情景的推测性特征的不满也在增加。

Personal distaste, needless to say, bears no necessary relationship to scien­tific validity. After all, what could be more unpleasant, but also more fac­tually undeniable, than personal mortality? But when distasteful conclusions gain popularity by appealing to supposedly scientific support, and when this "support" rests upon little more than favored speculation in an orthodox mode of increasingly dubious status, then popular misuse can legitimately sharpen a scientist's sense of unhappiness with the flawed theoretical basis be­hind a particular misuse. In any case, I trust that this compendium of reasons will dispel Cain's (1979) hurtful assertion that Lewontin, I, and other evolu­tionists who questioned early forms of sociobiology by developing a general critique of adaptationism, had acted cynically, and even anti-scientifically, in opposing biological theories that we knew to be true because we disliked their political implications for explaining human behavior. My own growing doubts about adaptationism arose from several roots, mostly paleontological, with any displeasure about sociobiology serving as a late and minor spur to further examination and synthesis.

个人的反感情绪显然与科学的有效性无关。毕竟，个人的死亡虽令人不快，却是无法否认的事实。然而，当一些让人不悦的结论通过所谓的科学支持逐渐流行，而这种支持仅仅依赖于在正统模式中受欢迎但地位可疑的推测时，这种流行的误用合理地加深了科学家对其背后不完善理论基础的不满。在这种情况下，我相信，这些理由可以消除 Cain（1979）的指责。他曾断言，Lewontin、我和其他一些通过对适应主义进行批判来质疑早期社会生物学的进化论者，因为不喜欢这些理论在人类行为解释上带来的政治影响，所以采取了玩世不恭甚至反科学的立场。其实，我对适应主义的怀疑主要源于多个方面，尤其是古生物学，而对社会生物学的不满只是促使我进一步研究和综合的一个次要因素。

I then tried to apply my general critique of pure Darwinian functionalism, and my conviction that important and positive constraints could be actively identified by quantitative morphometric study (and not merely passively in­ferred from failures of adaptationist scenarios) in my work on "covariance sets" in the growth, variation, and evolution of the West Indian pulmonate Cerion (Gould, 1984b and c), a snail that encompasses its maximal diver­sity in overt form among populations within a constraining set of pervasive allometries in growth. I discuss some of this work in my text on the empirical validation of positive constraint (see Chapter 10, pages 1045–1051).

然后，我尝试将我对纯粹达尔文功能主义的普遍批评应用于我的研究，并相信通过定量形态测量研究，可以积极识别重要的约束条件，而不仅仅是从适应失败的情景中被动推断出来。我在研究西印度肺螺 Cerion 的「协方差集合」时，探讨了这些蜗牛在成长过程中受到的普遍比例增长约束下，各个种群中形态的最大多样性表现（Gould，1984b 和 c）。在我的著作中，我讨论了这项工作的一些内容，特别是关于积极约束的实证验证（参见第 10 章，第 1045-1051 页）。

My doubts on the third branch of extrapolationism and uniformity began even earlier, and in a more inchoate way, but then gained expression in my ef­forts in the history of science, and not so much in my direct empirical work — hence, in part, the reduced attention devoted to this theme (Chapters 6 and 12) compared with the first two branches of selection's agency and efficacy. On a fieldtrip in my freshman geology course, my professor took us to a trav­ertine mound and argued that the deposit must be about 11,000 years old because he had measured the current rate of accumulation and then extrapo­lated back to a beginning. When I asked how he could assume such con­stancy of rate, he replied that the fundamental rule of geological inference, something called "the principle of uniformitarianism" permitted such infer­ences because we must regard the laws of nature as constant if we wish to reach any scientific conclusions about the past. This argument struck me as logically incorrect, and I pledged myself to making a rigorous analysis of the reasons.

我对外推主义和均一性第三分支的质疑其实由来已久，虽然起初比较模糊，但在我从事科学史研究时逐渐明晰，而不是通过直接的实证研究 —— 因此，相较于选择的作用与效能这两个主题（第 6 和第 12 章），我对它的关注有所减少。在我大学一年级的地质学实地考察中，教授带我们去看一个石灰华丘，他认为沉积物大约有 11,000 年的历史，因为他测量了当前的积累速度，并推断出起始时间。当我问他如何假定积累速率是恒定的时，他回答说，地质推论的基本原则，即「均变论原则」，允许这样推断，因为如果我们想对过去得出科学结论，就必须假设自然法则是恒定的。我觉得这一论点在逻辑上不太对劲，于是决心进行深入分析。

As a joint major in geology and philosophy, I studied this issue throughout my undergraduate years, producing a paper entitled "Hume and uniform­itarianism" that eventually transmogrified into my first publication (Gould, 1965), "Is uniformitarianism necessary?" (Norman Newell, my graduate ad­visor, urged me to send the paper to Science where, as I learned to my amuse­ment much later, my future "boss" at Harvard, the senior paleontology pro­fessor Bernie Kummel, rejected it roundly as a reviewer. Properly humbled — although I still regard his reasons as ill founded — I then sent the paper to a specialty journal in geology.)

我在本科阶段主修地质学和哲学，并一直研究这一问题。在此期间，我撰写了一篇题为《休谟与均变论》的论文，后来演变为我 1965 年的第一篇出版物《均变论是必要的吗？》。我的研究生导师 Norman Newell 鼓励我将论文投稿到《科学》杂志。令我后来颇为好笑的是，我未来的「老板」—— 哈佛大学的高级古生物学教授 Bernie Kummel，作为审稿人，严厉拒绝了这篇论文。这让我认识到了自己的不足，尽管我仍然认为他的拒绝理由并不充分。于是，我将论文投到了一本地质学专业期刊。

May I share one shameful memory of this otherwise iconoclastic first paper, from which I still draw some pride? In my undergraduate work on this theme, I made a personal discovery (as others did independently) that became impor­tant in late 20th-century studies of the history of geology. I had been schooled in the conventional view that the catastrophists (aka "bad guys") had in­voked supernatural sources of paroxysmal dynamics in order to compress the earth's history into the strictures of biblical chronology. I read and reread all the classical texts of late 18th and early 19th century catastrophism in their original languages — and I could find no claim for supernatural influences upon the history of the earth. In fact, the catastrophists seemed to be advanc­ing the opposite claim that we should base our causal conclusions upon a lit­eral reading of the empirical record, whereas the uniformitarians (aka "good guys") seemed to be arguing, in an opposing claim less congenial with the ste­reotypical empiricism of science, that we must make hypothetical inferences about the gradualistic mechanics that a woefully imperfect record does not permit us to observe directly.

能否允许我分享一个关于这篇具有标志性意义的论文的羞愧回忆呢？即便如此，我仍为此感到些许自豪。在我本科阶段研究这一主题时，我个人发现了一项重要成果（与其他人的独立发现类似），后来在 20 世纪末的地质学历史研究中变得重要。过去，我被教育要相信传统观点，即灾变论者（被称为「坏人」）为了将地球历史压缩到圣经年代学的框架内，曾诉诸超自然的剧变动力学。然而，当我用原文阅读并反复研读 18 世纪末和 19 世纪初的灾变论经典文本时，却找不到任何关于超自然影响地球历史的论述。事实上，灾变论者似乎主张我们应基于对经验记录的字面解读来进行因果分析，而均变论者（被称为「好人」）则提出相反的观点，认为我们必须对那些无法直接观察到的渐进机制进行假设推理，这一观点与科学的经验主义刻板印象不太一致。

But, although I had developed and presented an iconoclastic exegesis of Lyell, I simply lacked the courage to state so general a claim for inverting the standard view about uniformitarians and catastrophists. I assumed that I must be wrong, and that I must have misunderstood catastrophism because I had not read enough, or could not comprehend the subtleties at this fledgling state of a career. So I scoured the catastrophist literature again until I found a quote from William Buckland (both a leading divine and the first reader in ge­ology at Oxford) that could be interpreted as a defense of supernaturalism. I cited the quotation (Gould, 1965, p. 223) and stuck to convention on this broader issue, while presenting an original analysis of multiple meanings — some valid (like the invariance of law) and some invalid (like my professor's claim for constancy in range of rates) — subsumed by Lyell under the singular description of "uniformity" in nature.

然而，尽管我已经对莱尔的观点提出了一种全新的解释，但我还是缺乏勇气去挑战关于均变论者和灾变论者的传统看法。我觉得自己可能有误解，可能是因为阅读不够广泛，或者在职业生涯的早期阶段无法理解其中的细微之处。于是，我再次仔细研究了灾变论的文献，直到找到 William Buckland 的一句话（他是著名神学家和牛津大学第一位地质学讲师），这句话可以用来支持超自然主义。我引用了这句话（Gould，1965，p. 223），并在这个更广泛的问题上沿袭传统观点，同时提出了对「自然的一致性」这一概念的多重解释 —— 其中一些是合理的（比如法律的不变性），而另一些则不太合理（如我教授所说的速率范围恒定性）。

This work led me, partly from shame at my initial cowardice, and as others reassessed the scientific character of catastrophism, to a more general analysis of the potential validity of catastrophic claims, and particularly to an under­standing of how assumptions of gradualism had so stymied and constrained our comprehension of the earth's much richer history. These ideas forced me to question the necessary basis for Darwin's key assumption that observable, small-scale processes of microevolution could, by extension through the im­mensity of geological time, explain all patterns in the history of life — namely, the Lyellian belief in uniformity of rate (one of the invalid meanings of the hy­brid concept of uniformitarianism). This exegesis led to a technical book about concepts of time and direction in geology (Gould, 1987b), to an en­larged view that encouraged the development of punctuated equilibrium, and to a position of cautious favor towards such truly catastrophic proposals as the Alvarez theory of mass extinction by extraterrestrial impact — a concept ridiculed by nearly all other paleontologists when first proposed (Alvarez et a\., 1980), but now affirmed for the K-T event, and accepted as an empirical basis for expanding our range of scientifically legitimate hypotheses beyond the smooth extrapolationism demanded by this third branch of Darwinian central logic.

我因为最初的怯懦感到些许羞愧，并且随着其他人对灾变论的科学性质进行重新评估，我开始更广泛地分析灾变理论的潜在可信度，特别是渐变假设如何限制了我们对地球丰富历史的理解。这些思考让我质疑达尔文的一个关键假设，即小规模的微进化过程可以通过漫长的地质时间解释生命历史中的所有模式。这一假设基于莱尔所信奉的速率一致性（这是均变论中被误解的一个方面）。这种反思促使我撰写了一本关于地质学中时间和方向概念的技术书（Gould，1987b），并扩展了我的视野，推动了间断平衡理论的发展。我也开始对如阿尔瓦雷斯提出的由外星撞击导致的大灭绝理论持谨慎支持的态度 —— 尽管这一理论在最初提出时几乎遭到了所有古生物学家的嘲笑（Alvarez et al.，1980），但现在它已被确认用于解释 K-T 事件，并成为我们拓展科学假设范围的经验基础，而不是仅限于达尔文学说第三分支所要求的平滑外推。

In addition to these disparate accretions of revisionism on the three branches of Darwinian central logic, one further domain — my studies in the history of evolutionary thought — served as a sine qua поп for wresting a co­herent critique from such an inchoate jumble of disparate items. Above all, if I had not studied Darwin's persona and social context so intensely, I doubt that I would ever have understood the motivations and consistencies — also the idiosyncrasies of time, place and manner — behind the abstract grandeur of his view of life. History, as I argued before (see p. 35), must not be dis­missed as a humanistic frill upon the adamantine solidity of "real" science, but must be embraced as the coordinating context for any broad view of the logic and reasoning behind a subject so close to the bone of human concern as the science of life's nature and structure. (Of the two greatest revolutions in scientific thought, Darwin surely trumps Copernicus in raw emotional im­pact, if only because the older transition spoke mainly of real estate, and the later of essence.)

在达尔文中心逻辑的三个分支上进行各种不同的修正之外，我在进化思想史上的研究是从这样一堆杂乱无章的材料中提炼出连贯批判的关键。特别是，如果我没有如此深入地研究达尔文的个性及其社会背景，我很难理解他对生命的宏伟抽象背后的动机和一致性，以及与时间、地点和方式相关的独特性。如我之前所述（见第 35 页），历史不应被视为所谓「真正」科学的附属人文装饰，而应作为协调背景，帮助我们全面理解生命的性质和结构这一与人类息息相关的科学背后的逻辑和推理。在科学思想的两次重大革命中，达尔文无疑在情感影响力上超过了哥白尼，因为前者涉及的是人类的本质，而后者主要讨论的是地理位置。

Some of my historical writing appeared in the standard professional litera­ture, particularly my thesis about the "hardening" of the Modern Synthesis (Gould, 1980e, 1982a, 1983b), a trend (but also, in part, a drift) towards a stricter and less pluralistic Darwinism. Several full-time historians of science then affirmed this hypothesis (Provine, 1986; Beatty, 1988; Smocovitis, 1996). But much of the historical analysis behind the basic argument of this book had its roots (in my consciousness at least) in the 300 consecutive monthly essays that I wrote from 1974 to 2001 in the popular forum of Nat­ural History magazine, where I tried to develop a distinctive style of "mini in­tellectual biography" in essay form — attempts to epitomize the key ideas of a professional career in a biographic context, and within the strictures of a few thousand words. By thus forcing myself to emphasize essentials and to discard peripherals (while always searching out the truly lovely details that best exemplify any abstraction), I think that I came to understand the ma­jor ideological contrasts between the defining features of Darwinian theory and the centerpieces of alternative views. In this format, I first studied such structuralist alternatives as Goethe's theory of the archetypal leaf, Geoffroy's hypothesis on the vertebral underpinning of all animals, and on dorsoventral inversion of arthropods and vertebrates, and Owen's uncharacteristic English support for this continental view of life. I also developed immense sympathy for the beauty and raw intellectual power of various alternatives, even if I eventually found them wanting in empirical terms. And I came to understand the partial validity, and even the moral suasion, in certain proposals unfairly ridiculed by history's later victors — as in reconsidering the great hippocam­pus debate between Huxley and Owen, and recognizing how Owen used his (ultimately false) view in the service of racial egalitarianism, while Huxley misused his (ultimately correct) interpretation in a fallacious defense of tradi­tional racial ranking.

我有一些历史写作发表在专业文献中，尤其是关于现代综合理论「硬化」现象的论文（Gould，1980e，1982a，1983b）。这个现象指的是向更加严格和单一的达尔文主义转变的趋势（部分来说也是一种自然的演变）。之后，一些全职的科学史学家也支持了这一观点（Provine，1986; Beatty，1988; Smocovitis，1996）。不过，本书基本论点的许多历史分析，其实可以追溯到我在 1974 年到 2001 年间为《自然历史》杂志撰写的连续 300 篇月度文章中。在这个大众平台上，我努力发展了一种独特的「迷你知识传记」风格 —— 尝试在传记的背景下，用几千字的篇幅总结一个职业生涯的核心思想。通过这种方式，我必须强调关键要点，摒弃次要内容（同时寻找最能体现抽象概念的精彩细节）。我认为，这让我能更好地理解达尔文理论的核心特征与各种替代理论之间的主要思想对比。在这种格式下，我首先研究了像歌德的原型叶理论、Geoffroy 关于所有动物脊椎支撑的假设，以及节肢动物和脊椎动物的背腹反转，和 Owen 对这种大陆生命观的支持。我对这些替代理论的美感和强大的智力吸引力感到钦佩，即使最终在实证上发现其不足。我也开始理解某些提议的部分有效性，甚至是道德说服力，这些提议在历史后来的胜利者中被不公正地嘲笑。例如，重新思考 Huxley 和 Owen 之间关于海马体的争论，认识到 Owen 如何将他（虽然错误的）观点用于支持种族平等，而 Huxley 则错误地利用他（虽然正确的）解释来捍卫传统的种族等级制度。

Finally, my general love of history in the broadest sense spilled over into my empirical work as I began to explore the role of history's great theoretical theme in my empirical work as well — contingency, or the tendency of com­plex systems with substantial stochastic components, and intricate nonlinear interactions among components, to be unpredictable in principle from full knowledge of antecedent conditions, but fully explainable after time's actual unfoldings. This work led to two books on the pageant of life's history (Gould, 1989c; Gould, 1996a). Although this book, by contrast, treats general theory and its broad results (pattern vs. pageant in the terms of this text), rather than contingency and the explanation of life's particulars, the science of contingency must ultimately be integrated with the more conventional sci­ence of general theory as explored in this book — for we shall thus attain our best possible understanding of both pattern and pageant, and their different attributes and predictabilities. The closing section of the book (pp. 1332–1343 of Chapter 12) offers some suggestions for these future efforts.

我对历史的深厚热爱逐渐影响到我的实证研究，我开始研究历史中重要理论主题在研究中的作用 —— 偶然性。偶然性指的是具有复杂随机成分的复杂系统以及其组件之间错综复杂的非线性互动，这些系统在原则上难以通过已有条件来预测，但随着时间的推移，它们的变化过程可以被完全解释。这一研究引发了我撰写两本关于生命历史的书籍（Gould，1989c; Gould，1996a）。虽然这本书主要探讨一般理论及其广泛结果（即本书所说的「模式」对比「场面」），而不是偶然性与生命细节的解释，但最终必须将偶然性的科学与本书中探讨的一般理论科学结合起来 —— 这样我们才能更好地理解「模式」和「场面」及其各自的特性和可预测性。在书的最后部分（第 12 章，第 1332-1343 页），我提出了一些关于未来研究方向的建议。

When I ask myself how all these disparate thoughts and items fell together into the one long argument of this book, I can only cite — and I don't know how else to put this — my love of Darwin and the power of his genius. Only he could have presented such a fecund framework of a fully consistent theory, so radical in form, so complete in logic, and so expansive in implication. No other early evolutionary thinker ever developed such a rich and comprehen­sive starting point. From this inception, I only had to explicate the full origi­nal version, tease out the central elements and commitments, and discuss the subsequent history of debate and revision for these essential features, culmi­nating in a consistent reformulation of the full corpus in a helpful way that leaves Darwin's foundation intact while constructing a larger edifice of in­terestingly different form thereupon. Clearly I do not honor Darwin by hagiography, if only because such obsequious efforts would make any honest character cringe (and would surely cause Darwin to spin in his grave, thus up­setting both the tourists in Westminster Abbey and the adjacent bones of Isaac Newton). I honor Darwin's struggles as much as his successes, and I fo­cus on his few weaknesses as entry points for needed revision — his acknowledged failure to solve the "problem of diversity," or his special pleading for progress in the absence of any explicit rationale from the operation of his central mechanism of natural selection.

当我思考这些不同的想法和内容是如何汇聚成这本书中一长篇的论述时，我只能说，这是由于我对达尔文的热爱以及他非凡的天赋。只有他才能提出这样一个富有成果的框架，一个形式前卫、逻辑完整、意义深远的理论。没有其他早期的进化论思想家能发展出如此丰富而全面的起点。从这个起点出发，我只需阐明完整的原始版本，提炼出核心要素和承诺，并探讨这些基本特征在后续争论和修订中的历史，最终在保留达尔文基础的同时，以一种有益的方式重新构建一个形式更大且有趣的建筑。显然，我不是通过歌颂来表达对达尔文的敬意，因为这样的奉承只会让任何诚实的人感到不安（这也一定会让达尔文感到不安，从而打扰到西敏寺大教堂的游客和旁边牛顿的遗骸）。我同样重视达尔文的奋斗和他的成功，并且我将注意力放在他的少数弱点上，作为进行必要修订的切入点 —— 他承认未能解决「多样性的问题」，或者他在没有任何明确理由的情况下特别主张进步来源于他自然选择的核心机制的运作。

As a final comment, if this section has violated the norms of scientific discourse (at least in our contemporary world, although not in Darwin's age) by the liberty that I have taken in explicating personal motives, errors and cor­rections, at least I have shown how we all grope upward from initial stupid­ity, and how we would never be able to climb without the help and collabora­tion of innumerable colleagues, all engaged in the intensely social enterprise called modern science. I experienced no eureka moment in developing the long argument of this book. I forged the chain link by link, from initial pos­session of a few separate items that I didn't even appreciate as pieces of a sin­gle chain, or of any chain at all. I made my linkages one by one, and then of­ten cut the segments apart, in order to refashion the totality in a different order. So many people helped me along the way — from long dead antecedents by their wise words to younger colleagues by their wisecracks — that I must view this outcome as a social project, even though I, the most arrogant of lite­rati, insisted on writing every word. Perhaps I can best express my profound thanks to the members of such an intellectual collectivity by stating, in the most literal sense, that this book would not exist without their aid and sufferance. My formal dedication to my two dearest and closest paleontological collaborators in this effort to formulate macroevolutionary theory records the worthy apex of an extensive pyramid. Scientists fight and squabble as all folks do (and I have scarcely avoided a substantial documentation thereof in this book). But we are, in general, a reasonably honorable lot, and we do em­brace a tendency to help each other because we really do revel in the under­standing of nature's facts and ways — and most of us will even trade some per­sonal acclaim for the goal of faster and firmer learning. For all the tensions and unhappinesses in any life, I can at least say, with all my heart, that I chose to work in the best of all enterprises at the best of all possible times. May our contingent future only improve this matrix for my successors.

作为最后的评论，如果我在这一部分中因为自由地阐述个人动机、错误和修正而违反了当代科学交流的规范（尽管在达尔文时代这并不被视为违规），至少我展示了我们如何从最初的无知中摸索前进，并且在没有无数同事帮助与合作的情况下，我们不可能取得进展。这些同事都参与了现代科学这项高度社会化的事业。在撰写这本书的过程中，我没有经历过灵光一现的时刻。我是通过一点一点地将零散的信息连接起来，才构建出整个论点的。起初，我手中只有一些孤立的观点，甚至没有意识到它们属于同一个体系。我逐步将这些观点联系起来，但常常需要重新调整这些联系的顺序。许多人在这个过程中帮助了我 —— 从已故前辈的智慧之言到年轻同事的妙语。因此，我必须将这本书视为一个集体的成果，尽管我这个有些自负的作家，坚持亲自撰写每一个字。或许，我可以用最直接的方式表达对这个知识集体的深切感谢：如果没有他们的支持和包容，这本书是不可能完成的。我正式将这本书献给我在宏观进化理论研究中最亲爱和最亲密的古生物学合作者们，他们是这个庞大合作网络的巅峰。尽管科学家们也像其他人一样会有争执（在这本书中我几乎没有回避记录这些），但我们总体上还是一个值得尊敬的群体。我们确实倾向于互相帮助，因为我们真正享受理解自然奥秘的过程 —— 大多数人甚至愿意为了更快、更深入的学习而牺牲一些个人荣誉。尽管生活中充满了紧张和不如意，我可以满怀信心地说，我选择了在所有可能的最佳时机，投身于最伟大的事业。希望未来能继续优化这个环境，让后继者受益。

### 1.4 Epitomes for a Long Development

#### Levels of Potential Originality

Most of this book can be described as extensive narration of work already done, and ideas already expounded elsewhere. But no one should write at such length merely to organize the conventional material of a field, and without an original structure, or a set of unconventional ideas, to propose. I wrote The Structure of Evolutionary Theory because I felt that I had fol­lowed a sufficiently idiosyncratic procedure to devise a sufficiently novel the­oretical structure that then yielded a sufficient number of original insights on specific matters to qualify as a justification for spending so many years of a career, and daring to ask readers for such a non-trivial chunk of their at­tention.

这本书的大部分内容是对已有研究和思想的详细叙述。然而，仅仅为了整理某一领域的常规内容而写一本书是没有意义的，除非能提出一个独特的结构或一套非常规的想法。我之所以写《进化理论的结构》，是因为我认为自己采用了一种独特的方法，构建了一个新颖的理论结构，并在具体问题上提出了许多原创见解。这些成就足以证明我多年努力的价值，并值得读者给予认真的关注。

As implied by the foregoing sentence, I think that whatever originality this work possesses might best be conceptualized at three levels of basic structure, primary justifications for the major components of theory, and specific in­sights or discoveries then developed under the aegis of this structure and the­ory. At the first level of basic structure, I believe that three features of organi­zation set the novelty of presentation:

如前文所提，我认为这项工作的独特性可以从三个层面来理解：基本结构、理论主要组成部分的核心理由，以及在该结构和理论指导下发展的具体见解或发现。在第一个层面上，我认为组织的三个特征体现了其表现的新颖性：

1 Developing an exegesis of essential components in the logic of Darwin­ian theory, as expressed in the agency, efficacy, and scope of selection as an evolutionary mechanism (Chapter 2).

阐述达尔文理论逻辑中的基本组成部分，尤其是在选择作为进化机制的代理性、效力和范围方面（第 2 章）。

2 Explicating the history of evolutionary thought as a complex and ex­tended debate about these essential components, developed negatively at first by early evolutionists who sought alternative formulations to Darwinism (Chapters 3–6), and then positively in our times by scientists who recognized the need for extensive revisions and expansions that would build an enlarged structure upon a Darwinian foundation, rather than uproot the theoretical core of selectionism (Chapters 7–12).

2 进化思想史是一场围绕基本要素的复杂且漫长的讨论。最初，早期的进化论者对达尔文主义提出了质疑，试图寻找替代的理论（第 3-6 章）。而到了现代，科学家们意识到，有必要在达尔文主义的基础上进行全面的修订和扩展，以构建一个更大的理论框架，而非推翻选择论的核心理论（第 7-12 章）。

3 Formulating an expanded theory that introduces substantial revisions on each branch of Darwinian central logic, but builds, in its ensemble, a coher­ently enlarged structure with a retained Darwinian base — moving from Dar­win's single level of agency to a hierarchical theory of selection on the first branch; balancing positive sources of internal constraint (for both structural and historical reasons) with the conventional externalism of natural selection on the second branch; and recognizing the disparate inputs of various tiers of time, rather than trying to explain all phylogenetic mechanics by uniformitarian extrapolation from microevolutionary processes, on the third branch.

3 我们提出了一个扩展的理论，对达尔文中心逻辑的每个分支进行了实质性的修订，同时作为一个整体仍保留了达尔文的基础。首先，在第一个分支中，我们从达尔文的单一代理层次转变为选择的层次化理论。其次，在第二个分支中，我们在自然选择的传统外部性中，加入了内部约束的积极因素，这些约束源于结构和历史原因。最后，在第三个分支中，我们认识到不同时间层次输入的差异性，而不是简单地通过微观进化过程的均变论来解释所有的系统发育机制。

At the second level of validation for proposed revisions in the structure of evolutionary theory, I have tried to develop broad arguments and empirical justifications for major changes and expansions on each of the three branches of Darwinian central logic. On the first branch of agency, the theory of punc­tuated equilibrium itself, initially formulated by Niles Eldedge and me, estab­lishes the species as a true and potent Darwinian individual, and grants a minimal guarantee of descriptive independence to macroevolution by requir­ing a treatment of trends as the differential success of stable species rather than the adaptive anagenesis of lineages by accumulated and extrapolated organismal selection alone. Beyond punctuated equilibrium, the general ra­tionale for a hierarchical theory of selection, as presented here through the interactor approach based on emergent fitnesses at higher levels, may estab­lish a complete (and tolerably novel) framework not only for grasping the consistent logic of hierarchical selection, but also for viewing each level as po­tent in its own distinctive way, and for recognizing the totality of evolution­ary outcomes as a realized balance among these potencies, and not as the achieved optimality of a single causal locus — a substantial difference from Darwinian traditions for conceiving the dynamics of evolutionary change. In working through the differences among levels — see Chapter 8, pp. 714–744 — I was particularly struck by the surprising, but accurate and challeng­ing, analogies (Lamarckian inheritance at the organismal level with adaptive anagenesis at the species level, for example); and by the different modes of equally effective change implied by disparate structural reasons for the estab­lishment of individuality at various levels (particularly, the domination of se­lection over drift and drive at the organismal level vs. the potent balance among all three mechanisms at the species level).

在对进化理论结构提出修订的第二阶段验证中，我尝试为达尔文中心逻辑的三个分支提出广泛的论点和实证依据。在第一个关于自主性（agency）的分支中，由 Niles Eldedge 和我最初提出的间断平衡理论，将物种确立为一个真实且强有力的达尔文个体，并通过要求将进化趋势视为稳定物种的差异性成功，而不是仅靠生物选择的积累和推演来进行适应性渐进，从而为宏观进化提供了基本的独立描述保障。除了间断平衡之外，本书通过基于在更高层次上出现的适应能力（emergent fitness）的交互体（interactor）方法，提出了一种选择的层级理论的通用原理。这个框架不仅帮助我们理解层级选择的一致逻辑，也让我们看到每个层级都以其独特的方式发挥作用，并将进化结果视为这些作用力之间的平衡，而非单一原因的最佳化 —— 这与达尔文传统对进化动态的理解有本质性的区别。在探讨不同层级的差异时（详见第 8 章，第 714–744 页），我尤其被一些令人惊讶但准确且具有挑战性的类比所吸引，如生物层面的拉马克遗传与物种层面的适应性渐进的类比；以及由于在各层级上确立个体性而导致的同样有效变化的不同模式（尤其是生物层级上的选择对漂移与驱动的支配，与物种层级上这三者之间的平衡的不同）。

On the second branch of efficacy, I have tried to make the most comprehensive case yet advanced for internal constraint as a positive director and channeler of evolutionary change, and not only as a negative brake upon pure Darwinian functionalism. I proceed by explicating two conceptually different forms of constraint — structural constraints as consequences of physical prin­ciples, and historical constraints as channels from particular pasts. I argue that each category challenges a different central tenet of Darwinism — struc­tural constraint by establishing a substantial space for non-selectionist origin of important evolutionary features, and historical constraint for explaining the markedly inhomogeneous filling of morphospace as flow down ancient internal channels of deep homology, and not primarily as a mapping of adap­tive design upon current ecological landscapes. Beyond any novelty in this general formulation, I have attempted to develop a conceptual space, and to establish practical criteria, for the identification of non-adaptive sequelae (spandrels), the evolutionary importance of their later cooptation for utility (exaptation), and the importance of such reservoirs of potential (exaptive pools) in explicating the important concept of "evolvability" in structural rather than purely adaptational terms.

关于有效性的第二个方面，我尝试提出一个全面的论点，探讨内部约束如何积极引导和促进进化变化，而不仅仅是对纯粹达尔文功能主义的制约。我通过阐述两种不同的约束形式来分析这个问题：源于物理原理的结构约束，以及由特定历史路径形成的历史约束。我认为，每种约束形式都挑战了达尔文主义的不同核心原则。结构约束为重要进化特征的非选择性起源提供了空间，而历史约束通过解释形态空间的不均匀填充，展示了源于深层同源性的古老内部通道的流动，而不是简单地反映当前生态环境的适应性设计。除了这种新颖的表述之外，我还试图构建一个概念框架，并建立实际标准，以识别非适应性结果（例如拱形结构）、它们被后续实用化（适应外）的进化重要性，以及这些潜力储备（适应外池）在理解「可进化性」这一重要概念时，从结构而非纯粹适应性角度的意义。

On the third branch of scope, my contribution cannot claim much novelty, if only because I have not worked professionally in this area of paleontological research. But I do explicate, perhaps more fully than before, both the historical and conceptual reasons for regarding catastrophic mass extinction, and catastrophic mechanics in general (within their limited scope of validity), not as anti-selectionist per se, but rather as fracturing the extrapolationist premise of Darwinian central logic, and requiring that substantial aspects of phyletic pattern be explained as interaction between temporal extensions of microevolution and different processes that only become visible and effective at higher tiers of time. I try to resolve "the paradox of the first tier" (the em­pirical failure of Darwin's logically airtight argument for a vector of progress) by arguing that punctuated equilibrium at the second tier of phyletic trends, and mass extinction at the third tier of faunal overturn, impose enough of their own, distinctive and different, patterning to forestall the domination or pure imprint of extrapolated microevolutionary results upon the general pag­eant of life's history.

在第三个研究领域，我的贡献并没有太大的创新性，主要是因为我在这个古生物学方向上没有进行过专业的研究工作。然而，我确实比以往更全面地解释了历史和概念上的原因，说明为何将灾难性大灭绝和灾难性机制（在其有限的适用范围内）视为非反选择主义，而是作为打破达尔文核心逻辑的外推假设。这要求我们将系统发育模式的重要方面解释为微进化的时间延伸与那些只有在更长时间尺度上才显现和有效的不同过程之间的互动。我尝试解决「第一层次悖论」（即达尔文关于进步趋势的逻辑严密论证在经验上失败）的方式，是通过论证在第二层次的系统发育趋势间断平衡和第三层次的动物群大灭绝中，施加了其自身足够独特且不同的模式，这样可以防止外推的微进化结果在生命历史的整体进程中占据绝对主导地位或留下纯粹的印记。

Finally, at the third level of those lovely details (where both God and the devil dwell, and where, ultimately, both the joy and power of science reside), I trust that any originality I have introduced at "higher" levels of theoretical structure gains primary expression and utility in the resolution of previously puzzling details, and in the identification of "little things" that had escaped previous notice or explicit examination.

最后，在细节的第三个层次上（那里既是细节之处，又是科学乐趣和力量的所在），我相信我在理论结构较高层次引入的任何原创性，首先会表现在解决那些曾经令人困惑的细节上，并识别出那些过去未被关注或明确研究的小事。

For example, most original analyses and discoveries in the historical first half of this book flow directly from my organizing theme of identifying essen­tial components in Darwinian logic, and then tracing both the early attempts to defeat, and our later efforts to modify and expand them through time. I was thus able to discover and identify Darwin's major encounter with higher level selection not in his recognized discussion of group selection for human altruism, but in his previously unexplicated admission of species selection to resolve the problem of diversity (see Chapter 3, pp. 246–250). In this case, I "lucked out" through an odd reason for previous ignorance of such an im­portant textual revision — for Darwin omitted this material in his compressed and hasty discussion of diversity in Chapter 4 of the Origin (on this subject, the only Darwinian source generally known to professional biologists, who would immediately highlight the importance of any acknowledgment of spe­cies selection). But Darwin agonized over levels of selection at explicit length in the unpublished "long version" that only saw the light of printed day in 1975 (Stauffer, 1975), and that virtually no practicing biologist has ever read (whereas historians of science who do study this longer text usually lack suf­ficient knowledge of the technical debate about levels of selection to under­stand the meaning of Darwin's passages or to appreciate their import).

例如，本书前半部分的大多数原创分析和发现，都是基于我对达尔文逻辑基本要素的识别，并追踪早期对这些逻辑的挑战及我们后来对其进行修改和扩展的过程。因此，我能够发现达尔文与高层次选择的主要关联，不是在他著名的人类利他主义的群体选择讨论中，而是在他未曾详细解释过的关于物种选择如何解决多样性问题的承认中（见第 3 章，第 246-250 页）。在这方面，我由于一个奇怪的原因而「走运」—— 达尔文在《物种起源》第 4 章中关于多样性的简短论述中遗漏了这些重要内容（在这个主题上，专业生物学家一般只了解达尔文的这一部分，他们会立即注意到任何关于物种选择的承认的重要性）。然而，达尔文在未发表的「长版」中曾详细讨论过选择的不同层次，这个版本直到 1975 年才出版（Stauffer，1975），几乎没有生物学家阅读过。而研究这篇长文的科学史学家通常又缺乏对选择层次技术争论的充分了解，难以理解达尔文段落的意义或体会其重要性。

The same context led me to appreciate the previously unanalyzed development of a full hierarchical model by Weismann in his later works (Chapter 3, pp. 223–224), a formulation that Weismann himself identified as the most important theoretical achievement of his later career. Previous historians had written about his much longer and earlier explications of lower level selection (germinal selection in his terms), if only in the context of modern reductionistic breakdowns of Darwinism to selection among "selfish genes." But they had missed his later reversal and expansion to a full hierarchical model, despite Weismann's own emphasis. Similarly, de Vries's clear understanding of Darwinian logic had also been ignored because de Vries, as an opponent of the efficacy of Darwinian organismal selection (a painful decision for him, given his psychological fealty to Darwin, also explored herein), applied the logic to higher levels, and even devised the term "species selection" (Chapter 5, pp. 446–451) — a concept and coining previously entirely unremarked by historians (much to the embarrassment of scientists, including yours truly, who coined and explicated the same term much later in full expectation of pristine originality!).

在相同的背景下，我注意到 Weismann 在其后期作品中发展出一个完整的层次模型。这个模型之前未被分析，而 Weismann 自己认为这是他后期职业生涯中最重要的理论成就（第 3 章，第 223–224 页）。过去的历史学家们曾讨论过他早期关于低层选择（即他所称的胚芽选择）的详细解释，但这些讨论主要局限于现代将达尔文主义简化为「自私基因」选择的视角。然而，他们忽视了 Weismann 后来的转变及其向完整层次模型的扩展，尽管 Weismann 本人对此给予了重视。同样地，de Vries 对达尔文逻辑的深刻理解也未被充分注意。尽管他反对达尔文的有机体选择（这一立场对他来说是艰难的，因为他对达尔文有深厚的心理忠诚，这在本文中也有所探讨），他将达尔文的逻辑应用于更高层次，并创造了「物种选择」一词（第 5 章，第 446–451 页）—— 这一概念和术语之前完全未被历史学家注意到。这让包括我在内的科学家感到尴尬，因为我们后来才创造并解释了这个术语，并以为是全新的原创！

Similarly, my sense of the logic in conflicts between constraint and adapta­tion (or internal vs. external, or formal vs. functional approaches) on the second branch helped me to pinpoint, or to make sense of, several important historical events and arguments that have not been properly treated or under­stood. Historians of science had not previously discussed orthogenetic theo­ries in this fairest light, and had not distinguished the very different formula­tions of Hyatt, Eimer, and Whitman in terms of their increasingly greater willingness to accommodate Darwinian themes as well (see Chapter 5). The same framework allowed me to identify the crucial importance, and brilliant epitomization, of this issue in the final paragraphs of Chapter 6 ("Difficulties on Theory") in Darwin's Origin, a significance that had not been highlighted before.

我对第二个分支中约束与适应（或内部与外部，或形式与功能方法）之间冲突逻辑的理解，帮助我识别出一些重要的历史事件和论点，这些事件和论点以前并没有得到恰当的处理或理解。科学史学家过去没有从最公正的角度讨论过正向进化理论，也没有区分 Hyatt、Eimer 和 Whitman 各自在逐步接受达尔文思想时的不同观点（参见第 5 章）。同样的分析框架让我发现，在达尔文的《物种起源》第 6 章（「理论的困难」）的最后几段中，这个问题的重要性和精彩总结，这是之前未被充分强调的。

I also traced the dichotomy of anglophonic preferences for functionalist accounts vs. continental leanings towards formalism back through the evo­lutionary reconstruction of the argument in the mid 19th century into the creationist formulations of Paley vs. Agassiz (Chapter 4), thus illustrating a pedigree for this fundamental issue in morphology that evolution may have recast in causal terms, but did not budge in basic commitments to the mean­ing of morphology. Among the little tidbits that emerge from such analy­ses, I even discovered that Darwin borrowed his clearest admission of co-opted utility from non-adaptive origins (unfused skull sutures in mammalian neonates, essential for passage through the birth canal, but also existing in birds and reptiles born from more capacious eggs) from the longer and more nuanced descriptions of Richard Owen, Britain's anomalous defender of for­malism.

我追溯了英语国家偏好功能主义解释，而大陆地区倾向于形式主义的历史，这种分歧可以追溯到 19 世纪中期的进化论重构，尤其是创世论者 Paley 与 Agassiz 的表述（第 4 章）。这说明了形态学中一个基本问题的历史渊源，虽然进化论可能在因果关系上重新定义了这个问题，但在形态学意义上的基本立场上并没有改变。通过这样的分析，我甚至发现达尔文清楚地承认了一种观点，即某些结构最初可能并非为了当前的用途而进化出来（例如哺乳动物新生儿的未融合颅缝对通过产道至关重要，但这种结构也存在于从更宽大蛋中出生的鸟类和爬行动物中）。这一观点实际上源自英国学者 Richard Owen 对形式主义更长且更为细致的描述。

I also included some historical analyses in the book's second half on mod­ern advances because I thought they could make an original contribution to arguments usually developed only in contemporary terms and findings. I have already mentioned my analysis of how the initial pluralism of the Modern Synthesis (embracing any mode of change consistent with known genetic mechanisms) hardened through subsequent editions of the founding volumes into pronounced preferences for adaptationist accounts framed only in terms of natural selection (Chapter 7). In addition, I think that my reexhumation of the debate between Falconer and Darwin on fossil elephants provides a good introduction to punctuated equilibrium (Chapter 9, pp. 745–749). The largely unknown paradox of Lankester's original definition of homoplasy as a category of homology, rather than in the opposite status held by the term to­day, provides the best entry I could devise for understanding the vital, but lit­tle appreciated and rarely acknowledged, theoretical differences between par­allelism and convergence. In the absence of this context and distinction, the key importance of evo-devo and the discovery of deep homology among dis­tant phyla cannot properly be grasped as a challenge and expansion of Dar­winian expectations (Chapter 10).

在书的后半部分，我加入了一些关于现代进展的历史分析，因为我认为这些分析可以为通常仅限于当代术语和发现的论点提供新的视角。我提到过，现代综合理论最初是多元化的，接受任何与已知遗传机制一致的变更模式，但随着创始文献的不断修订，它逐渐倾向于仅通过自然选择来解释适应现象（第 7 章）。此外，我重新审视了 Falconer 和 Darwin 关于化石大象的争论，这为间断平衡理论提供了一个很好的切入点（第 9 章，第 745-749 页）。Lankester 最初将同源性定义为同源的一种类型，这一悖论提供了理解平行演化和趋同演化之间重要理论差异的最佳途径，这些差异常常被忽视。没有这样的背景和区别，我们很难将 evo-devo 的重要性和在远缘生物门类中发现的深层同源性视为对达尔文预期的挑战和拓展（第 10 章）。

I hope that my sympathetic portrayal of D'Arcy Thompson's theory of form (Chapter 11), despite my general disagreement with his argument, will help colleagues to understand the thrust and potential power of this unusual formulation of structuralist constraint on external grounds of universal phys­ics. Although I am chagrined that I discovered Nietzsche's account of the dis­tinction between current utility and historical origin so late in my work, I know no better introduction — from one of history's greatest philosophers to boot, and in his analysis of morality, not of any scientific subject — to the the­oretical importance of spandrels and exaptation in the rebalancing of con­straint and adaptation within evolutionary theory (Chapter 11, pp. 1214–1218). In a final historical analysis of the second part, I think that Dar­win's own rationale for progress (Chapter 12, pp. 1296–1303), rooted not in the mechanics of natural selection itself, but in an ecological argument for extrapolation of biotic competition through time in a perpetually crowded world — an aspect of Darwin's thought that has very rarely been appreciated, formulated or discussed by historians — provided the best context I could de­vise for understanding why catastrophic mass extinction in particular, and non-extrapolation through tiers of time in general, play such havoc with Dar­win's need for uniformity on the third branch of his essential logic.

我希望我对 D'Arcy Thompson 形态学理论（第 11 章）的同情的描述，尽管我总体上不同意他的论点，能帮助同事们理解这种基于普遍物理学外部基础的结构主义约束的非同寻常结构的要点和潜在力量。尽管我很懊恼自己在研究中如此晚才发现尼采关于当前效用和历史起源区分的描述，但我不知道有比这更好的介绍 —— 而且这是历史上最伟大的哲学家之一在分析道德时提出的，而非任何科学主题 —— 对在进化理论中约束和适应之间再平衡的重要性，即拱顶和适应的理论重要性（第 11 章，第 1214-1218 页）。

在第二部分的最后历史分析中，我认为达尔文对进步的合理性（第 12 章，第 1296-1303 页）并非根植于自然选择机制本身，而是基于一种生态学论点，即在持续拥挤的世界中生物竞争随着时间推移的外推。这是达尔文思想中很少被历史学家欣赏、形式化或讨论的一个方面，它为理解为何灾难性的大规模物种灭绝特别是，以及一般的时间层次的非外推，给达尔文在其基本逻辑的第三分支上的一致性需求带来如此大的混乱，提供了我能设想的最佳背景。

The original claims in the book's second half on modern reformulations of evolutionary theory rest, necessarily and primarily, on theoretical insights and unusual conceptual parsings, rather than on novel data — if only be­cause custom dictates that my extensive empirical documentation be pre­sented in "review" format by collating published studies in support or refuta­tion of general themes under discussion. But I have sometimes presented existing data in novel contexts — as in my analysis of the proper category for understanding the exaptive value of genes lost by founder drift in establish­ing the social cohesion (albeit transient) that has made the Argentine ant Linepithema humile such a successful invader of non-native Californian habi­tats (Chapter 11, pp. 1282–1284). I have also cited my own empirical studies, previously published but original in the more conventional sense, to support important pieces of more general arguments, including validation of punctu­ated equilibrium by dissection of a single bedding plane to reveal transition by absolute age dating of individual shells (Goodfriend and Gould, 1996), the "employment" of constraint by selection to yield several adaptive features by one heterochronic change in a case of neoteny in Gryphaea (Jones and Gould, 1999), and the explanation of most ordered geographic variation within a major subregion of Cerion as consequences of allometric correlations in growth (Gould, 1984b).

在书的下半部分，我关于现代进化理论重构的论点主要依赖于理论见解和独特的概念解析，而不是新数据。这是因为传统上，我需要通过「综述」的形式，将已发表的研究汇编起来，以支持或反驳所讨论的主题。不过，我有时会在新的情境中呈现已有的数据。比如，我分析了因奠基者漂移失去的基因在建立阿根廷蚁（Linepithema humile）社会凝聚（尽管是暂时的）中的适应性价值，这种社会凝聚使得它们成功入侵了非原生的加利福尼亚栖息地（第 11 章，第 1282–1284 页）。此外，我还引用了自己以前发表的实证研究，这些研究在传统意义上是原创的，用于支持一些更为普遍的论点。例如，通过对单一沉积层的解剖和对个别贝壳的绝对年代测定，验证间断平衡（Goodfriend 和 Gould，1996）；通过选择对限制的运用，在 Gryphaea 的一种幼态持续现象中，通过一个异时性变化产生多个适应性特征（Jones 和 Gould，1999）；以及解释 Cerion 的一个主要子区域内的多数有序地理变异是生长中异速相关的结果（Gould，1984b）。

I tried (and utterly failed) to compose a selective listing, as provided above for the book's historical half, for original ideas about theoretical details devel­oped in revising the three branches of Darwinian central logic in the book's second half on modern reformulations of evolutionary theory. I ripped up several attempts that read like the hodge-podge of a random laundry list rather than the ordered "sweet places" on a logical continuum. These high­lights, I finally recognized, have little meaning outside the broader context of a linearly developing argument for each branch, and I will therefore make a second attempt, within the more detailed epitome of the next and final sec­tion of this chapter, to designate the points that struck me with the force of "aha," or that conveyed a hint of deeper, surprising, or more radical implica­tions for reasons that I couldn't quite fathom directly, but that tickled my in­tuition at the edge of that wonderful, if elongate, German word: Finger — spitzengefuhl, or feeling at the tip of one's finger. Most inchoate excitements of this sort lead to nowhere but foolishness and waste of time, but every once in a while, the following of one's nose catches a whiff of novelty. At least we must trust ourselves enough to try — and not take ourselves so seriously that we forget to laugh at our more frequent and inevitable stumbles.

我试图为书的历史部分编写一个精选清单，用于总结书的后半部分在现代进化理论重述中修订达尔文核心逻辑三个分支的理论细节。然而，我多次尝试都失败了，结果看起来更像是一个杂乱无章的清单，而不是一个有序的逻辑发展过程。我意识到这些亮点离开了每个分支的系统发展背景几乎没有意义。因此，我将在本章最后一部分更详细地总结时，再次尝试指出那些令我感到「啊哈」的时刻，或者那些暗示更深层次、令人惊讶或激进含义的点。这些点虽然我无法直接理解，但却触动了我的直觉，就像那个德语词「Finger — spitzengefuhl」所描述的那样：指尖的感觉。尽管大多数这样的模糊兴奋往往无果而终，只是浪费时间，但有时跟随直觉会发现新的东西。至少，我们要相信自己，尝试一下 —— 同时也不要太过认真，以至于忘记笑对我们那些频繁且不可避免的错误。

#### An Abstract of One Long Argument

I have insisted, borrowing Darwin's famous line in my arrogance, that this "whole volume is one long argument," flowing logically and sequentially from a clear beginning in Darwin's Origin to our current reformulations of evolutionary theory. But this structural thread of Ariadne can easily become lost in the labyrinth of my tendencies to expatiate on little factual gems, or to follow the thoughts of leading scientists into small, if lovely, byways of their mental complexities. Hence, I need to present summaries and epitomes as guidelines.

我一直坚持地认为，借用达尔文的名言，这「整本书构成了一场长篇辩论」，从达尔文《物种起源》的清晰起点，逻辑连贯地延伸到我们对进化论的现代重新诠释。然而，这种如亚里阿德涅之线般的结构主线，常常在我倾向于详细探讨小的事实亮点，或随领先科学家深入其思想复杂性的小径时走失。因此，我需要提供一些摘要和概要来作为指引。

Long books, like large bureaucracies, can easily get bogged down in a ba­roque layering of summary within summary. The United States House of Representatives has a Committee on Committees (I kid you not), undoubt­edly embellished with subcommittees thereof. And we must not forget Jona­than Swift's famous verse on the fractality of growing triviality in scholarly commentary:

长篇书籍和庞大的官僚机构有相似之处，容易被繁琐的层层总结所困扰。美国众议院甚至设有一个名为「委员会的委员会」的组织（这可不是玩笑），而且还可能设有许多下属的小委员会。我们也不能忘记乔纳森·斯威夫特那句著名的诗句，形象地描绘了学术评论中不断增长的琐碎性。

So, naturalists observe, a flea

Hath smaller fleas that on him prey;

自然主义者指出，一只跳蚤上还有更小的跳蚤在捕食它；

And these have smaller still to bite 'em

And so proceed ad infinitum.

而这些小生物又会被更小的生物咬住如此循环往复，直至无穷。

Thus every poet, in his kind,

Is bit by him that comes behind.

因此，每位诗人，总会被后来者超越。

I wrote, on page 13, that this book includes three levels of embedding for this long argument — the summary in this chapter, the epitome of Darwin in Chapter 2, and the development of the totality. Now, and most sheepishly, I add two more, for a fractal total of five — the listed abstract, in pure "book order," of this section, and (God help us) the epitome of this epitome, pre­sented now to introduce and guide the list.

我在第 13 页提到，这本书为这个冗长的论述设计了三个层次的嵌入 —— 包括本章的总结，第二章中关于达尔文的概要，以及整体的展开。而现在，我需要再加两个层次，总共有五个层次 —— 即按照「书籍顺序」列出的本节摘要，以及当前呈现的这个概要的进一步概述，用于引导和解释这个列表。

I develop my argument throughout this book by asserting, first, that the central logic of Darwinism can be depicted as a branching tree with three ma­jor limbs devoted to selection's agency, efficacy and scope. Second, that Dar­win, despite his heroic and explicit efforts, could not fully "cash out" his the­ory in terms of the stated commitments on each branch — and that he had to allow crucial exceptions, or at least express substantial fears, in each domain (admitting species selection to resolve the problem of diversity; permitting an uncomfortably large role for formalist correlations of growth as compromis­ers of strict adaptationism; expressing worry that mass extinction, if more than an artifact of an imperfect fossil record, would derail the extrapolationist premise of his system). Third, that the subsequent history of evolution­ary debate has focused so strongly upon the key claims of these three essential branches that we may use engagement with them as a primary criterion for distinguishing the central from the secondary when we need to gauge the im­portance of challenges to the Darwinian consensus. Fourth, that we should not be surprised by the prominence of these three themes, for they embody (in their biological specificity) the broadest underlying issues in scientific expla­nation, and in the nature of change and history: levels of structure and causal­ity, rates of alteration, directions of causal flow, the possibility of causal uni­fication by reduction to the lowest level vs. autonomy and interaction of irreducible levels, punctuational vs. gradual change, causal and temporal tier­ing vs. smooth extrapolation. Fifth, that the most interesting and impor­tant debates in our contemporary science continue to engage the same three themes, thus requiring the vista of history to appreciate the continuity and logical ordering that extends right back to Darwinian beginnings. Sixth, that our best modern understanding of the structure of evolutionary theory has re­versed the harmful dichotomization of earlier debates (Darwinian fealty vs. destructive attempts to trivialize or overturn the mechanism of selection) by confronting the same inadequacies of strict Darwinism, but this time intro­ducing important additions and revised formulations that preserve the Dar­winian foundation, but build a theory of substantial expansion and novelty upon a retained selectionist core.

在这本书中，我逐步展开论证，提出以下几点：首先，达尔文主义的核心逻辑可以被形象地看作是一棵分枝的树，三个主要分支分别涉及选择的主体、效能和范围。其次，尽管达尔文做出了巨大而明确的努力，他无法在每个分支上完全实现他的理论 —— 他不得不在各个领域中允许关键的例外，或者至少表达了相当大的担忧。例如，他承认物种选择以解决多样性问题；允许形式主义生长相关性在适应主义中扮演重要角色；对大规模灭绝的担忧，如果这不仅仅是化石记录不完整的结果，将会破坏其理论的外推基础。第三，后来的进化辩论历史如此强烈地关注于这三个关键主张，以至于当我们需要评估对达尔文共识的挑战重要性时，可以将与它们的交锋作为区分核心与次要的主要标准。第四，这三个主题的突出地位并不令人意外，因为它们在特定的生物学背景中反映了科学解释的最基本问题，以及变化与历史的本质：结构和因果关系的层次，变化的速度，因果关系的方向，是通过简化到最低层次来实现因果统一，还是强调不可简化层次的自主性和互动性；是断续变化还是渐进变化；是因果关系和时间的分层还是平滑的外推。第五，现代科学中最有趣和重要的辩论仍然围绕这三个主题展开，因此我们需要历史视角来理解这种从达尔文开始的连续性和逻辑顺序。第六，我们对进化理论结构的现代理解已经逆转了早期辩论中的有害二分法（即对达尔文忠诚与试图琐碎化或推翻选择机制的破坏性尝试），通过面对严格达尔文主义的不足之处，同时引入重要的补充和修订的表述，这些表述保留了达尔文主义的基础，但在保留的选择主义核心上构建了一个具有实质性扩展和创新的理论。

This logic and development may be defended as tolerably impersonal and universal, but any book of this length and complexity, and of so idiosyncratic a style and structure, must also own its authorial singularities. The Structure of Evolutionary Theory emerges, first of all, from my professional focus as a paleontologist and a student of macroevolution, defined, as explained on page 38, as descriptive phenomenology prior to any decision about the need for distinctive theory (my view) or the possibility of full subsumption un­der microevolutionary principles (the view of Darwin and the Modern Syn­thesis). The contingency of history guarantees that any body of theory will underdetermine important details, and even general flows, in the realized pageant of life's phylogeny on Earth — and such a claim for nontheoretical independence of macroevolution generates no dispute, even between rigid reductionists who grant no separate theoretical space to macroevolution, and biologists, like myself, who envisage an important role for distinctive macroevolutionary theory within an expanded and reformulated Darwinian view of life.

这种逻辑和发展可以被认为是相当客观和普遍的，但任何一本这样长且复杂的书，尤其是风格和结构如此独特的作品，也必须承认其作者的独到之处。《进化论的结构》首先源自我作为古生物学家和宏观进化研究者的专业兴趣，如第 38 页所述，宏观进化被定义为在决定是否需要独特理论（我的观点）或完全归入微观进化原则的可能性（达尔文和现代综合的观点）之前的一种描述性现象学。历史的偶然性意味着，任何理论体系都难以完全解释地球上生命进化过程中出现的重要细节，甚至整体趋势。即便是那些不认为宏观进化需要独立理论空间的严格化约论者，也不会对宏观进化的理论独立性产生争议。而像我这样的生物学家则认为，在扩展和重构的达尔文生命观中，宏观进化理论具有重要作用。

In his description of the reductionist view of classical Darwinism — his own opinion in positive support, not a simplistic caricature in opposition — Hoffman (1989, p. 39) writes: "The neodarwinian paradigm therefore asserts that this history of life at all levels — including and even beyond the level of speciation and species extinction events, embracing all macroevolutionary phenomena — is fully accounted for by the processes that operate within pop­ulations and species." I dedicate my book to refuting this traditional claim, and to advocating a helpful role for an independent set of macroevolutionary principles that expand, reformulate, operate in harmony with, or (at most) work orthogonally as additions to, the extrapolated, and persistently relevant (but not exclusive, or even dominant) forces of Darwinian microevolution.

在描述他所支持的经典达尔文主义的还原论观点时，Hoffman（1989，p. 39）写道：「新达尔文主义范式主张，生命历史在各个层面上的一切，包括物种的形成与灭绝，以及所有宏观进化现象，都可以通过种群和物种内部的过程来完全解释。」我的书旨在挑战这一传统观点，并倡导一套独立的宏观进化原则。这些原则是对达尔文微观进化力量的补充和调整，与之协调运作，或者在某些情况下，作为独立的补充存在。

This perspective of synergy confutes the contrary, and ultimately destruc­tive, attempts by late 19th and early 20th century macroevolutionists to de­velop substitute mechanisms that would disprove or trivialize Darwinism, and that spread such a pall of suspicion over the important search for non-reductionistic and expansive evolutionary theories — a most unfortunate (if historically understandable) trend that stifled, for several generations, the unification and fruitful expansion of evolutionary theory to all levels and temporal tiers of biology. Thus, for example, my attempt to develop a specia-tional theory of macroevolution (Chapters 8 and 9), with species treated as irreducible Darwinian individuals playing causal roles analogous to those oc­cupied by organisms in Darwinian microevolution, represents an extension of Darwinian styles of explanation to another hierarchical level of analysis (with interestingly different causal twists and resulting patterns), not a refuta­tion of natural selection from an alien realm. (Such a speciational theory, however, does counter Hoffman's reductionistic claim of full theoretical suf­ficiency for "processes that operate within populations and species" — for, given the stasis of species under punctuated equilibrium, such macroevolu­tionary patterns originate by higher-order sorting among stable species, and not primarily by processes occurring anagenetically within the lifetime of these higher-level Darwinian individuals.) Similarly, the different rules of cat­astrophic mass extinctions require additions to the extrapolated Darwinian and microevolutionary causes of phyletic patterns, but do not refute or deny the relevance of conventional uniformitarian accretions through geological time. (In fact, a more comprehensive theory that seeks to integrate the rela­tive strengths, and interestingly disparate effects, of such different levels and forms of continuationist vs. catastrophic causality offers greater richness to Darwinian perspectives as both underpinnings and important contributors to a larger totality.)

这种协同的视角反驳了 19 世纪末和 20 世纪初宏观进化论者试图通过其他机制来否定或简化达尔文进化理论的观点。这种观点在历史上虽然可以理解，但它给非还原主义和扩展进化理论的重要探索蒙上了怀疑的阴影，阻碍了几代人对于进化理论在生物学各个层次及时间层级上的统一和扩展。因此，例如，我试图提出一种宏观进化的物种理论（第 8 章和第 9 章），将物种看作不可分割的达尔文个体，承担类似于达尔文微观进化中生物体的因果角色。这种方法将达尔文的解释风格扩展到了另一个层次的分析（带有不同的因果变化和结果模式），而不是从外部领域反驳自然选择。（然而，这种物种理论确实反驳了霍夫曼关于「在种群和物种内运行的过程」具有完全理论充足性的还原主义主张 —— 因为在间断平衡（punctuated equilibrium）下，物种的停滞状态表明，这种宏观进化模式主要是通过稳定物种间的高层次排序产生，而不是仅通过这些高层次达尔文个体生命周期内的变化过程产生。）同样，灾难性大规模灭绝的特殊规则需要补充传统达尔文和微观进化的原因来解释谱系模式，但并不否定或排除通过地质时间累积的相关性。（事实上，一个更全面的理论试图结合这些不同层次和形式的持续性与灾难性因果关系的相对强度及效果，从而为达尔文视角增添了丰富性，成为一个更大整体的重要基础和贡献者。）

A second authorial input must arise from the distinctive ontogeny of past work. The Structure of Evolutionary Theory occupies a much broader terri­tory than my first lengthy technical book of an earlier career, Ontogeny and Phylogeny (1977b). The motivating conceit of the first book rested upon my choice of a much smaller compass defined by a much clearer tradition of definition and research. I thought — thus my designation of this strategy as a conceit — that I could quote, in extenso and from original sources, every im­portant statement, from von Baer and before to de Beer and after, on the rela­tionship between development and evolution. This potential for comprehen­siveness brought me much pleasure and operational motivation.

第二个作者的观点源于过去工作的独特发展历史。《进化论结构》所涵盖的领域比我职业生涯早期的第一本长篇技术书《个体发育与系统发育》（1977b）要广泛得多。第一本书的动机设想是基于我选择的一个较小的范围，这个范围有着更明确的定义和研究传统。我曾想 —— 因此将这一策略称为设想 —— 可以详尽地引用并直接从原始资料中引用每一个重要的声明，这些声明从冯·贝尔及之前到德·比尔及之后，探讨了发育与进化之间的关系。这种全面性的可能性给了我很多乐趣和动力。

In fact, I soon realized that I could not succeed, even within this limited sphere — and I therefore punted shamelessly in the final result. I did manage to quote every important passage on the theoretical relationship between these central subjects of biology, but I passed, nearly completely, on the actual use of these putative relationships in specific proposals for phylogenetic recon­structions. And, as all historians of science and practitioners of evolutionary biology know, this genre of "phylogenizing" represented by far (at least by weight) the dominant expression of this theoretical rubric in the technical lit­erature. I would, by the way, defend my decision as entirely reasonable and proper, and not merely as practically necessary, because these specific phylo­genetic invocations made effectively no contribution to the development of evolutionary theory — my central concern in the book — and remained both speculative and transient to boot. But I do remember the humbling experi­ence of realizing that a truly full coverage could only represent a pipe dream, if applied to any important subject in a vigorous domain of research!

事实上，我很快意识到，即便在这个有限的领域，我也无法取得成功 —— 因此在最终结果中，我毫不羞愧地选择放弃。我确实设法引用了关于生物学这些核心主题之间理论关系的每一个重要段落，但几乎完全跳过了将这些假定关系用于具体系统发育重建方案的实际应用。而众所周知，在科学史学家和进化生物学研究者看来，这种「系统发育化」的写作风格在技术文献中无疑是这种理论框架的主要表达形式。顺便说一下，我想为我的决定辩护一下，认为这是完全合理且适当的，而不仅仅是出于实际的需要，因为这些具体的系统发育引用实际上对进化理论的发展没有贡献 —— 这是我在书中的核心关注点 —— 而且这些引用仍然是推测性的且短暂的。不过，我确实记得意识到，如果要对任何重要的研究领域进行真正全面的覆盖，那将只是一个幻想，这让我感到受挫！

My personal love of such thoroughness (with the necessary trade-off of limitation in domain) posed a substantial problem when I decided to expand my range from ontogeny and phylogeny to the structure of evolutionary the­ory. Of all genres in scholarship, I stand most strongly out of personal sympa­thy with broad-brush views that attempt to encompass entire fields (the his­tory of philosophy from Plato to Pogo, or of transportation from Noah to NASA) in a breathless summary paragraph for each of many thousand inci­dents. Even the most honorable efforts by great scholars — former Librarian of Congress Daniel Boorstin's The Explorers, for instance — make me cringe for simplistic legends repeated and interesting complexities omitted. At some level, truly important and subtle themes can only be misrepresented by such a strategy.

我个人对这种彻底性的喜爱（尽管这意味着在领域上有所限制）在我决定将研究范围从个体发育和系统发育扩展到进化理论结构时，成为了一个很大的难题。在所有学术类型中，我最不认同的是那些试图用概括性的视角来总结整个领域的观点，比如从柏拉图到波哥的哲学史，或从诺亚到 NASA 的交通史，这些观点常常将成千上万个事件简化成一个草率的总结段落。即使是像前美国国会图书馆馆长 Daniel Boorstin 的《探索者》这样出色的学术作品，也让我觉得不安，因为它们往往重复简单化的传说，而忽略了有趣的复杂性。在某种程度上，重要而微妙的主题往往在这种简化的策略下被误导。

But how then to treat the structure of evolutionary theory in a reputable, even an enlightening, way? Surely we cannot abandon all hope for writing honorably about such broad subjects simply because the genre of comprehen­sive listing by executive summary must propagate more mythology and mis­information than intrigue or understanding. As a personal solution to this crucial scholarly dilemma, and in developing the distinctive strategy of this book, I employed a device that I learned by doing, through many years of composing essays — a genre that I pursued by writing comprehensive personal treatments of small details, fully documentable in the space available, but also conveying important and general principles in their cascading implica­tions. I vowed that I would try to encompass the structure of evolutionary theory in its proper intellectual richness, but that I would do so by exhaustive treatment of well chosen exemplifying details, not by rapid summaries of in­adequate bits and pieces catalogued for all relevant participants.

那么，如何以一种既能获得尊重又能启发人心的方式来对待进化理论的结构呢？我们不能因为全面总结的写作方式可能传播更多的神话和错误信息，就放弃对这样广泛主题进行严谨写作的希望。为了解决这一关键的学术问题，并在本书中发展一种独特的策略，我采用了一种在多年写作文章中学到的方法 —— 通过对小细节的全面、个性化的处理，在有限的篇幅内充分记录，同时传达其带来的重要和普遍的原则。我立志要在智力上充分展现进化理论的结构，但我会通过详尽分析精心挑选的细节来实现，而不是通过快速总结所有相关参与者的零碎信息。

Under this premise, the central task then evolves (if I may use such a metaphor) into an extended exercise in discrimination. The solution may be la­beled as elitist, but how else can selection in intellectual history be under­taken? One must choose the best and the brightest, the movers and shakers by the sieve of history's harsh judgment (and not by the transiency of immedi­ate popularity) — and let their subtle and detailed formulations stand as a se­ries of episodes, each conveyed by an essay of adequate coverage. Luckily, the history of evolutionary thought — as one of the truly thrilling and expansive subjects of our mental lives — has attracted some of the most brilliant and fas­cinating doers and thinkers of intellectual history. Thus, we are blessed with more than adequate material to light the pathway of this particular odyssey in science. Luckily too, the founding figure of Darwin himself established such a clear basis of brave commitment that I could characterize, and then trace down to our own times, an essential logic that has defined and directed one of the most important and wide-ranging debates in the history of science into a coherent structure, ripe for treatment by my favored method of full coverage for the few truly central items (by knowing them through their fruits and logics, and by leaving less important, if gaudy, swatches gently aside in order to devote adequate attention to essential threads).

在这种情况下，核心任务就像是一个长期的筛选过程。尽管这种方法可能显得有些精英主义，但在知识历史中，我们如何进行选择呢？我们必须通过历史的严苛标准（而不是短暂的流行）来挑选出最优秀、最聪明的人物和推动者 —— 让他们的精妙而详细的阐释成为一系列故事，每个故事都由一篇全面的文章来呈现。幸运的是，作为我们思想生活中真正激动人心且广阔的主题之一，进化思想的历史吸引了一些知识历史上最聪明和最迷人的实践者和思想家。因此，我们有足够的素材来照亮这段科学旅程的道路。同时，达尔文作为这一领域的开创者，以其坚定的承诺为我们奠定了明确的基础，使我能够描绘并追溯到我们这个时代，形成一个定义并引导科学史上最重要、最广泛讨论之一的基本逻辑结构。这使得我可以用全面覆盖的方法，着重于少数真正核心的项目（通过了解他们的成果和逻辑，并将次要的部分轻轻放在一边），以便专注于关键的线索。

A third, and final, authorial distinction — my treatment of history and my integration of the history of science with contemporary research on evolu­tionary theory — emerges directly from this strategy of coverage in depth for a small subset of essential items and episodes. My historical treatments tend to resolve themselves into a set of mini intellectual biographies (as exemplified and defended on page 46) for almost all the central players in the history of Darwinian traditions in evolutionary thought. I can only hope that this pecu­liar kind of intellectual comprehensiveness will strike some readers as enlight­ening for the "quick entree" thus provided into the essential work of the peo­ple who led, and the concepts that defined, the history of the greatest and most consequential revolution in the history of biological science. (In most cases — a Goethe, Cuvier, Weismann, de Vries, Fisher or Simpson, for exam­ple — I chose people for their intrinsic and transcendent excellence. In fewer instances — an Eimer or Hyatt as proponents of orthogenesis, for example — I selected eminently worthy scientists not as great general thinkers, but as best exponents of a distinctive approach to an important subject in the history of debate on essentials of evolutionary theory.)

第三个，也是最后一个作者的独特之处在于我如何处理历史，并将科学史与现代进化理论研究结合起来。这一方法来源于我对少数重要事件和项目的深度研究策略。在处理历史时，我往往会为达尔文传统进化思想史上的核心人物撰写一系列小型知识传记（如第 46 页所展示和辩护的那样）。我希望这种独特的知识全面性能够对一些读者有所启发，使他们能快速了解引领和定义了生物科学史上这场伟大且具有深远影响的革命的人物和概念。（在大多数情况下，例如歌德、居维叶、魏斯曼、德弗里斯、费舍尔或辛普森，我选择这些人物是因为他们的卓越贡献。在少数情况下，例如正向发生论支持者艾默尔或海厄特，我选择了非常有价值的科学家，他们不是作为伟大的整体思想家，而是因为他们在进化理论历史辩论中独特的方法。）

A few figures in history have been so prescient in their principal contribu­tion, and so acute and broad-ranging in their general perceptions, that they define (or at least intrude upon) almost any major piece of a comprehensive discussion (A. N. Whitehead famously remarked, for example, that all philosophy might be regarded as a footnote to Plato). Evolutionary biology pos­sesses the great good fortune to embrace such a figure — Charles Darwin, of course — at the center of its origin and subsequent history. Thus, Darwin emerges again and again, often controlling the logic of discussion, through­out this book — in his own full foundational exegesis (Chapter 2); but then, in later chapters, as the principal subject, and best possible exemplification, of other important subbranches on all three boughs of his essential logic (his re­luctant acceptance of higher levels of selection in Chapter 3; his formalist contrast to his own functionalism in stressing "correlations of growth" in Chapter 4; his views on direction and progress in the history of life in Chapter 6, and, even in the book's second half on modern developments, for his dis­cussion of discordance between historical origin and current utility as a point of departure for my treatment of exaptation in Chapter 11, and his attempt to underplay and undermine mass extinction as an introduction to my cri­tique of uniformitarianism and extrapolationism in the final Chapter 12). Who could ask for a more attractive and effective coordinating "device" to tie the disparate strands of such an otherwise disorderly enterprise together than the genial and brilliant persona of the man who first gave real substance to the grandeur in this view of life?

历史上有一些人物，他们的主要贡献极具前瞻性，且对事物的总体认知敏锐而广泛，以至于他们几乎影响了每一次全面讨论的重要部分。A. N. Whitehead 曾著名地指出，所有哲学都可以看作是柏拉图的注脚。进化生物学非常幸运地拥有这样一位人物 —— 查尔斯·达尔文，他位于这一领域的起源和后续发展历史的中心。因此，达尔文在整本书中多次出现，常常主导讨论的逻辑。他在第 2 章中有完整的基础阐述；在后面的章节中，他成为主要话题，并且是其基本逻辑三个分支中其他重要子分支的最佳例证。例如，他在第 3 章中勉强接受更高层次的选择；在第 4 章中，他强调「生长的相关性」，将形式主义与他自己的功能主义对比；在第 6 章中，他探讨生命历史中的方向和进步。甚至在书的后半部分关于现代发展的讨论中，他对历史起源与当前实用性不一致的观点为我在第 11 章中探讨适应提供了基础，而他对大灭绝的轻描淡写成为了我在最后第 12 章中批判均变论和外推主义的导引。这样的一个人物，赋予生命观以伟大的实质，他的睿智和魅力成为了将这些本来无序的线索结合在一起的最佳「纽带」。

Whatever my dubiety about the role and efficacy of abstracts (too often, as we would all admit in honest moments, our only contact with a work that we nonetheless then feel free to criticize in full assurance of our rectitude), I can­not deny that a work of this length, imbued moreover with a tendency to pen­etrate byways along a basic route that seems (at least to this author) ade­quately linear and logical, demands some attempt to list its principal claims in textual order. Hence, I now impose upon you the following abstract:

虽然我对摘要的作用和效果持有怀疑态度（诚实地说，我们常常只是通过摘要了解一项工作，但这并不妨碍我们自信地对其进行全面评论），但我不得不承认，这样一篇篇幅较长且在看似线性和逻辑清晰的主线中深入细节的作品，确实需要按文本顺序列出其主要论点。因此，我现在为您提供以下摘要：

Chapter 2: An exegesis of the origin

1 All major pre-Darwinian evolutionary theories, Lamarck's in particu­lar, contrasted a primary force of linear progress with a distinctly secondary and disturbing force of adaptation that drew lineages off a main line into par­ticular and specialized relationships with immediate environments. In his most radical intellectual move, expressing both the transforming depth and the conceptual originality of the theory of natural selection, Darwin denied the existence of a primary progressive force, while promoting the lateral force of adaptation to near exclusivity. In so privileging uniformitarian extrapola­tion as an explanatory device, Darwin imbued natural selection, the lateral force, with sufficient power to generate evolutionary change at all scales by accumulating tiny adaptive increments through the immensity of geological time.

第 2 章：起源的阐释

1 在达尔文之前，所有主要的进化理论，尤其是拉马克的理论，将一种线性进步的主要力量与一种次要且扰乱的适应力量进行了对比。这种适应力量使得生物谱系偏离主线，形成与其直接环境的特定关系。在达尔文最激进的思想创新中，他否认了主要进步力量的存在，几乎完全侧重于适应的横向力量。这体现了自然选择理论的深刻变革性和创新性。通过这种偏重于解释的均一性外推方法，达尔文赋予自然选择足够的能力，能够在漫长的地质时间内，通过微小的适应性变化累积，产生各个层面的进化变化。

2 The Origin of Species exceeds all other scientific "classics" of past centu­ries in immediate and continued relevance to the basic theoretical formula­tions and debates of current practitioners. Careful exegesis of Darwin's logic and intentions, through textual analysis of the Origin, therefore assumes un­usual importance for the contemporary practice of science (not to mention its undeniable historical value in se).

《物种起源》比过去几个世纪的所有其他科学「经典」更贴近和影响着当前科学家的基本理论和争论。因此，通过文本分析深入研究达尔文的逻辑和意图，对于当代科学实践来说具有极其重要的意义，当然，它自身也具有无可争议的历史价值。

3 Darwin famously characterized the Origin as "one long argument" without explicitly stating "for what?" Assumptions about the focus of this long argument have ranged from the restrictively narrow (for natural selec­tion, or even for evolution) to the overly broad (for application of the most general hypotheticodeductive model in scientific argument, as Ghiselin has claimed). I take a middle position and characterize the "long argument" as an attempt to establish a methodological approach and intellectual foundation for rigorous analysis in historical science — a foundation that could then be used to validate evolution.

达尔文曾著名地称《物种起源》为「一场漫长的论证」，但他并没有明确说明这场论证的具体内容。人们对这场漫长论证重点的假设各不相同，有人认为是极其狭隘的自然选择，甚至仅仅是进化，也有人像 Ghiselin 那样，认为它涉及科学论证中最一般的假设演绎模型的应用。我持一种中间立场，认为这场「漫长的论证」旨在为历史科学的严格分析建立一种方法论和智力基础，这种基础可以用来验证进化理论。

4 The "long argument" for historical science operates at two poles — methodological and theoretical. The methodological pole includes a set of procedures for making strong inferences about phyletic history from data of an imperfect record that cannot, in any case, "see" past causes directly, but can only draw conclusions from preserved results of these causes. Darwin devel­ops four general procedures, all based on one of the three essential premises of his theory's central logic: the explanation of large-scale results by extrapo­lation from short-term processes. In order of decreasing information avail­able for making the required inference, these four procedures include: (1) ex­trapolation to longer times and effects of evolutionary changes actually observed in historic times (usually by analogy to domestication and horticul­ture); (2) exemplification and ordering of several phenomena as sequential stages of a single historical process (fringing reefs, barrier reefs and atolls as stages in the formation of coral reefs by subsidence of central islands, for ex­ample); (3) inference of history as the only conceivable coordinating explana­tion for a large set of otherwise disparate observations (consilience); and (4) inference of history from single objects based on quirks, oddities and imper­fections that must denote pathways of prior change.

历史科学的「长论证」在方法论和理论两个方面展开。在方法论方面，涉及一套程序，用于从记录不完整的数据中对系统发生历史进行有力推断。虽然这些记录无法直接观察到过去的原因，但可以从其保留下来的结果中得出结论。达尔文发展了四种通用程序，这些程序都基于他的理论的中心逻辑之一：通过从短期过程推断出大规模结果。按照可用信息量递减的顺序，这四种程序包括：首先，通过类比驯化和园艺，将历史时期实际观察到的进化变化推断至更长的时间和效果；其次，将多个现象作为单一历史过程的连续阶段进行实例化和排序，例如，边缘礁、堡礁和环礁是通过中央岛屿下沉形成珊瑚礁的不同阶段；然后，将历史推断为对一大组原本各异的观察结果进行协调解释的唯一可行方案；最后，根据物体的特性、奇异性和缺陷，从中推断出其历史变化路径。

5 The theoretical pole rests upon the three essential components of Darwinian logic: (1) agency, or organismal struggle as the appropriate (and nearly exclusive) level of operation for natural selection; (2) efficacy, or natu­ral selection as the creative force of evolutionary change (with complexly co­ordinated sequelae of inferred principles about the nature of variation, and of commitments to gradualism and adaptationism as foci of evolutionary analy­sis); and (3) scope, or extrapolationism (as described in point 4 just above). The logical coordination of these commitments, and their establishment as a brilliantly coherent and intellectually radical theory of evolution, can best be understood by recognizing that Darwin transferred the paradoxical argument of Adam Smith's economics into biology (best organization for the general polity arising as a side consequence of permitting individuals to struggle for Aemselves alone) in order to devise a mechanism — natural selection — that would acknowledge Paley's phenomenology (the good design of organisms said harmony of ecosystems), while inverting its causal basis in the most radical of all conceivable ways (explaining the central phenomenon of adaptation by historical evolution rather than by immediate creation, and recognizing nature's sensible order as a side consequence of unfettered struggle among individuals, rather than a sign of divine intent and benevolence).

理论的核心建立在达尔文逻辑的三个基本组成部分上：(1）个体作用，即生物个体的斗争是自然选择作用的主要（几乎是唯一的）层面；(2）效能，即自然选择作为驱动进化变化的创造性力量（包括对变异特点的复杂协调原则，以及对渐进主义和适应主义作为进化分析重点的承诺）；(3）范围，即外推理论（如第 4 点所述）。理解这些理论承诺如何逻辑地相互协调，并构成一个辉煌且激进的进化理论，最好的方法是意识到达尔文将亚当·斯密经济学中的悖论转移到了生物学中：即通过允许个体为自身利益而斗争，最终导致了一个更好的整体组织。达尔文设计的自然选择机制，承认了佩利的现象学（即生物体的精良设计和生态系统的和谐），同时从根本上颠覆了其因果基础：通过历史进化而非即时创造解释适应的中心现象，并认为自然的秩序是个体之间自由竞争的结果，而不是神圣意图的体现。

6 The first theme of agency: Darwin's commitment to the organismal level as the effectively exclusive locus of natural selection occupies a more central, and truly defining, role than most historians and evolutionists have recog­nized. Invocation of this most reductionistic locus then available (in igno­rance of the mechanism of inheritance) embodies the intellectual radicalism of Darwin's theory — using Adam Smith to overturn Paley, and holding that all higher-order harmony, previously attributed to divine intention, arises only as a side-consequence of selfish "struggle" for personal advantage at the lowest organismal level. Darwin devoted far more of the Origin to defending this organismal locus than most exegetes have acknowledged, particularly in centering his only two chapters on specific difficulties in natural selection (7 on Instinct and 8 on Hybridism) to resolutions provided by insistence upon organismal agency — explaining the establishment of adaptive sterile castes in social insects by selection upon queens as individuals, and resolving sterility in interspecific crosses as an unselected sequel of differences accumulated by organismal selection in each of two isolated populations, rather than as a di­rect result of higher-level species selection, as Wallace affirmed and as Darwin strove mightily and consciously to avoid. We can also trace his struggle to af­firm organismal exclusivity in his reluctances, underplayings and walling off (as unique and unrepeated elsewhere in nature) of the one exception (for hu­man altruism) that the logic of his system forced upon his preferences.

第一个关于能动性的主题是：达尔文坚持认为生物体层面是自然选择的唯一有效场所，这一观点比大多数历史学家和进化论者意识到的更为核心和决定性。当时由于不了解遗传机制，他选择了最具简化性的生物体层面，这体现了达尔文理论的智力激进性。他借用了亚当·斯密的经济理论，挑战了佩利的神创论观点，认为所有更高层次的和谐，不是由神的意图产生的，而是在最低生物体层面上为了个人利益的自私「斗争」的附带结果。达尔文在《物种起源》中花费了很多篇幅来捍卫生物体层面的重要性，这一点未被大多数研究者充分认识。他特别在第 7 章（本能）和第 8 章（杂交）中集中讨论自然选择的特定困难，并通过强调生物体的能动性来解决这些问题 —— 例如通过选择个体蜂王来解释社会性昆虫中适应性的无性繁殖阶级的形成；并将种间杂交的不育性解释为两个隔离种群中生物体选择导致的差异的副产品，而不是像华莱士所认为的那样，直接由更高层次的物种选择造成的。我们还可以看到，达尔文在处理人类利他主义这一例外时表现出的谨慎和保留，这种现象在他的逻辑体系中是被迫接受的唯一例外。

7 For his defense of the second theme of efficacy — his assertion of natural selection as the only potent source of creative evolutionary change — Darwin recognized that his weak and negative force, although surely a vera causa (true cause), could only play this creative role if variation met three crucial re­quirements: copious in extent, small in range of departure from the mean, and isotropic (or undirected towards adaptive needs of the organism). I would argue that Darwin's most brilliant intellectual move lay in his accurate identification, through the logical needs of his theory and not from any actual knowledge of heredity's mechanism, of these three major attributes of varia­tion — because he recognized that natural selection could not otherwise oper­ate as a creative force in the evolution of novelties.

对于关于效能的第二个主题的辩护 —— 达尔文认为自然选择是唯一强大的创造性进化力量 —— 他意识到，尽管自然选择是一个真实的原因，但要发挥创造性作用，变异必须满足三个关键条件：变化范围要广，偏离平均值的幅度要小，并且变化是各向同性的（即不朝着有机体的适应性需求发展）。我认为，达尔文最聪明的见解在于，他通过理论的逻辑需求，而不是依赖于当时对遗传机制的实际了解，准确地识别出了变异的这三个主要特征 —— 因为他知道，否则自然选择无法作为推动新事物进化的创造性力量。

8 Gradualism enters Darwin's system as another deductive intellectual consequence of asserting that natural selection acts as the creative mechanism of evolutionary change. Gradualism has three distinct meanings in Darwinian traditions, with only the second (or intermediate) statement relevant to the central assertion of selection's creativity. First, gradualism as simple historical continuity of stuff or information underlies the basic factuality of evolution vs. creation, and does not validate any particular mechanism of evolutionary change. Second, gradualism as insensible intermediacy of transitional forms specifies the Goldilockean "middle position" required by the mechanism of natural selection to refute the possibility that saltational variation might en­gender creative change all at once, thus relegating selection to a negative role of removing the unfit. Third, gradualism as a geological claim for slowness and smoothness (but not constancy) of rate plays a crucial role in the third theme (see point 10 of this list) of selection's scope, or the extrapolatability of microevolution to explain all patterns in geological time — and is therefore the aspect of gradualism that punctuated equilibrium refutes (for punctuated equilibrium questions Darwin's uniformitarian and continuationist beliefs, but not his mechanism of natural selection). This parsing of three distinctly different forms of gradualism, all embraced by Darwin for different rea­sons, alleviates the misunderstanding behind some unfortunate terminologi­cal wrangles without substance that have generated much heat (but little light) in recent debates.

渐变论作为一种演绎出的思想结果，进入了达尔文的系统，支持自然选择是进化变化的创造机制。达尔文传统中的渐变论有三种不同的含义，其中只有第二种与自然选择的创造性核心主张有关。首先，渐变论作为历史连续性的基本事实，阐述了进化与创造之间的区别，但并不支持特定的进化机制。其次，渐变论认为过渡形式是逐渐变化的，这种变化是自然选择需要的「适中位置」，以此来否定跃变能一次性带来创造性变化的观点，因此自然选择被视为淘汰不适者的手段。第三，渐变论在地质学上强调变化的缓慢和平稳（而非恒定），在选择范围的第三个主题中起关键作用，即微观进化能否解释地质时代的各种模式，因此是间断平衡理论所反驳的部分（因为间断平衡质疑达尔文的均变论和延续性信念，但不质疑他的自然选择机制）。通过区分这三种不同的渐变形式，可以减轻一些近期没有实质内容的术语争论所引发的误解，这些争论尽管引发了很多讨论，但带来的启示有限。

9 The adaptationist program as a primary strategy of research emerges as the third major implication of advocating natural selection as the primary creative force in evolutionary change — for this Darwinian style of evolution must proceed step by step, with each tiny increment of change rendering or­ganisms better adapted to alterations in local environments. To summarize all the key implications of this second theme of efficacy, the creativity of natural selection makes adaptation central, isotropy of variation necessary, and grad­ualism pervasive.

适应性程序作为研究的主要策略，是因为自然选择被视为进化变化的主要创造力的第三个重要意义。达尔文式的进化要求逐步进行，每个微小的变化都使生物更好地适应其局部环境的变化。总结这一第二主题的关键意义，自然选择的创造性使得适应成为中心，变化的各向同性（isotropy）是必要的，而渐进性则是普遍存在的。

10 Restriction of agency to the organismal level, and assertions of selec­tion's creativity, set a biological basis for the third essential claim of Dar­winian logic — selection's scope, or the argument that this incremental and gradualistic style of microevolution can, by smooth extrapolation through the immensity of geological time, build the full extent of life's anatomical change and taxonomic diversity by simple accumulation. I focus my shorter discussion of this third essential theme not upon biological needs (already covered in the first two themes), but upon the requirement for similar grad­ualistic styles of change in the geological stage that must present the evolu­tionary play — particularly in Darwin's embrace of Lyellian uniformity, and his denial of catastrophism (through arguments about the imperfection of the fossil record to allay the literal appearance of such rapidity in geological data), for even a fully consistent, intellectually sound, and operationally po­tent theory will not regulate actual events if surrounding conditions debar its operation.

将作用限制在生物体层面，并强调选择的创造力，为达尔文逻辑的第三个核心主张提供了生物学基础 —— 即选择的范围。这个主张认为，微观进化的渐进积累方式可以在漫长的地质时间中，通过平滑的外推，实现生命解剖结构和分类多样性的完全改变。我对这个第三个核心主题的简短讨论并不侧重于生物学需求（这些已在前两个主题中涉及），而是强调地质环境中需要类似的渐进变化风格，以展示进化的发展过程 —— 尤其是达尔文拥护莱尔的均变论，并通过化石记录不完善来反驳灾变论，以减轻地质数据中所显示的快速变化现象。因为即便是一个完全一致、逻辑合理且具有实用性的理论，如果周围的条件阻碍其应用，也无法对实际事件进行调控。

11 I use Kellogg's brilliant approach to the evaluation of Darwinian theory (published in 1907 in anticipation of centennial celebrations for Darwin's birth and the sesquicentenary of the Origin) to distinguish alternatives that deny the fundamental postulate of selection's creativity from auxiliaries that enlarge, adumbrate, or reformulate the theory of natural selection in basically helpful and consistent ways. I show that Darwinism may be epitomized by its three essential claims of agency, efficacy, and scope — and that the history of debate has always centered upon these themes, with critiques focusing upon destructive alternatives or constructive auxiliaries. I argue, as the major thesis of this book, that modern debates have developed important and coherent auxiliary critiques on all three branches of essential Darwinian logic, and that these debates may lead to a fundamentally revised evolutionary theory with a retained Darwinian core.

我借鉴了 Kellogg 在 1907 年为纪念达尔文诞辰一百周年和《物种起源》发表一百五十周年而发表的达尔文理论评估方法，以区分那些否定选择创造性这一基本假设的替代观点，以及那些从根本上有助于扩展、说明或重新表述自然选择理论的辅助观点。我指出，达尔文主义可以通过三个核心观点来概括：能动性、有效性和适用范围。历史上的争论一直围绕这些主题展开，批评主要集中在具有颠覆性的替代方案或富有建设性的补充观点上。我主张，作为本书的主要论点，现代争论在达尔文逻辑的这三个核心领域中形成了重要且一致的补充性批评，而这些争论可能会促成一个在保留达尔文核心基础上的全新进化理论。

Chapter 3: Seeds of hierarchy

1 Nearly all scientific revolutions originate as replacements and refuta­tions of previous explanatory schemes, not as pure additions to a former state of acknowledged ignorance. Lamarck's evolutionary theory, known to anglophonic readers as a first full account through the fair but critical descriptions of Lyell (in Volume 2, 1832, of the Principles of Geology), and from Chambers's promotion in the Vestiges of 1844, provided a context for Darwin's ref­utation. Darwin's single-level theory, based on the full efficacy of locally adaptive changes at the smallest scale, countered the only available alter­native of Lamarckism by relocating the major phenomenon that generated change and required explanation (local adaptation for Darwin, general prog­ress for Lamarck), and (far more radically) by reversing the conventional Paleyan explanation for the good design of organisms and the harmony of ecosystems (direct divine construction at the highest level vs. sequelae of nat­ural selection working at the lowest level of organismal advantage).

第 3 章：层级的种子

1 几乎所有的科学革命都是通过取代和反驳之前的解释方案而产生的，而不是简单地在已知的无知中添加新内容。Lamarck 的进化论，被英语读者通过 Lyell 在《地质学原理》第二卷（1832 年）中的公正但批判性的描述，以及 Chambers 在 1844 年《Vestiges》中的宣传所了解，为 Darwin 的反驳奠定了基础。Darwin 提出的单层理论，依赖于最小尺度上局部适应性变化的有效性，挑战了当时唯一的替代选择 ——Lamarck 主义。Darwin 通过重新定义变化的主要来源（他主张局部适应，而 Lamarck 则认为是普遍进步）来进行反驳，并更为激进地颠覆了传统的 Paley 式解释，后者认为生物的精妙设计和生态系统的和谐是由最高层次的神圣创造直接导致的，而 Darwin 则认为这是自然选择在生物体优势的最低层次上作用的结果。

2 Lamarck, a dedicated materialist with a two-factor theory of evolution as a contrast between linear progress up life's ladder and tangential deflec­tions of diversity through local adaptation, has been widely misunderstood (and reviled), both in Darwin's time and today, as a vitalist and pure expo­nent of "soft" or Lamarckian inheritance (which he accepted as the "folk wisdom" of his day, and invoked primarily to explain the secondary process of lateral adaptation).

拉马克是一位坚定的唯物论者，他提出了一种关于进化的理论，包含两个因素：一种是生命阶梯上的线性进步，另一种是通过局部适应导致的多样性变化。然而，在达尔文的时代以及今天，拉马克常被误解（甚至遭到批评）为主张生命力论和「软性」或拉马克式遗传的支持者。实际上，他只是接受了当时的「民间智慧」，并主要用这种理论来解释侧向适应的次要过程。

3 Darwin's theory of natural selection shared a functionalist basis with Lamarck in joint emphasis upon adaptation to external environment as the instigator of evolutionary change. But the two theories differ most radically in Darwin's citation of a single locus and mechanism of change — with the full range of evolutionary results proceeding by natural selection for local adapta­tion of populations to changing immediate environments, and all higher-level phenomenology emerging by sequential accumulation of such tiny incre­ments through the immensity of geological time. By contrast, Lamarck advo­cated a two-factor theory, with local adaptation as a merely secondary and diverging process (and, as we all know of course, arising by soft inheritance of acquired features generated by adaptive effort during an organism's life, rather than by natural selection of fortuitous variation), set against a primary process of progressive complexification up the ladder of life. Thus, Darwin embraced Lamarck's secondary force (instantiated by a different mechanism), denied the existence of Lamarck's primary force, and argued that the second­ary force of local adaptation also produced the large-scale results attributed by Lamarck to the primary force. Thus, this first major debate between evolu­tionary alternatives contrasted Lamarck's hierarchical theory with Darwin's single-level account. Hierarchy has been an important issue from the start (al­though, obviously, modern versions of hierarchical selection theory, advo­cated as the centerpiece of this book, bear no relationship, either genealogical or ideological, to this false, but fascinating, Lamarckian original).

达尔文的自然选择理论与拉马克的理论在功能主义基础上有共同点，都强调适应外部环境是进化变化的驱动力。但两者的根本区别在于达尔文强调单一的变化位置和机制 —— 所有进化结果都通过自然选择实现，种群为了适应不断变化的环境而进行局部调整，所有更复杂的进化现象都是通过漫长的地质时间不断积累这些微小变化而形成的。相比之下，拉马克提出了一个双因素理论，他认为局部适应只是次要的且是分化的过程（众所周知，这种适应是通过生物在生命周期中通过适应性努力获得特征的「软遗传」产生的，而不是自然选择的偶然变异），而主要过程是生命阶梯的逐步复杂化。因此，达尔文接受了拉马克的次要力量（但由不同的机制实现），否认了拉马克主要力量的存在，并认为次要的局部适应力量也能产生拉马克所认为的主要力量导致的大规模变化。由此，这场关于进化理论的首次重大辩论对比了拉马克的层级理论与达尔文的单一层级解释。一开始，层级问题就是一个重要议题（尽管本书中倡导的现代层级选择理论版本与这个错误但引人入胜的拉马克学说在传承或意识形态上没有任何关系）。

4 Darwin explicitly rejected Lamarck's two-factor theory, correctly identifying the disabling paradox that rendered the theory nonoperational: "what is important cannot be observed or manipulated (the higher-level force of progress), and what can be observed and manipulated (the tangential force of local adaptation) cannot explain the most important phenomenon (progress in complexification)." Darwin developed the first testable and operational theory of evolution by locating all causality in the palpable mechanism of natural selection.

达尔文并不认同拉马克的双因素理论，他指出了这个理论为何行不通的矛盾之处：「真正重要的进化驱动力（高级力量）难以直接观察和操控，而我们能够观察和操控的局部适应力量，却无法解释进化中的关键现象 —— 生物复杂性的增加。」达尔文通过将所有进化的因果关系归结于自然选择这一可验证的机制，建立了第一个可测试且可操作的进化理论。

5 In the first generation of Darwinian debate, August Weismann, clearly the most brilliant theorist of his time, and the only biologist (besides Darwin) who fully grasped the logic and implications of selection, wrestled with levels of selection throughout his career, and along an interesting path, finally devel­oping a full hierarchical theory that he explicitly identified as the most impor­tant conclusion of his later work. He began by trying to refute Lamarckian inheritance (and Herbert Spencer's vigorous defense thereof) by advocating the Allmacht (omnipotence, or literally "all might" or complete sufficiency) of natural selection. He first attributed the degeneration of previously useful structures (a bigger problem for Darwinism than the explanation of adaptive features) to what he called "panmixia" (not the modern meaning of the term, but the effect of recombination, in sexual reproduction, between adaptive ele­ments and inadaptive elements no longer subject to negative selection); then realized that this process could not explain complete elimination, thus lead­ing him to propose a lower level of subcellular selection, potentially acting in opposition to organismal selection, and called "germinal selection"; and finally recognized that if levels of selection existed below the organismal, then the same logic implies the existence and potency of supraorganismal levels as well.

在达尔文主义辩论的早期，August Weismann 是那个时代最杰出的理论家，也是除达尔文之外唯一完全理解自然选择逻辑及其影响的生物学家。他在其职业生涯中一直探讨自然选择的不同层次，并最终发展出一个完整的分层理论。他将其视为其后期工作中最重要的结论。起初，他试图通过倡导自然选择的全能性来反驳拉马克遗传学说及赫伯特·斯宾塞对此的辩护。他最初解释先前有用结构的退化，认为这是「泛混合」作用的结果（这个术语在此处指的是性繁殖中适应性元素和不再受负选择影响的非适应性元素之间的重组效应）。随后，他意识到这一过程无法解释完全的消除，因此提出了一种可能与生物体选择相对立的亚细胞选择，称为「胚原选择」。最后，他认识到如果在生物体之下存在选择层次，那么同样的逻辑也意味着在生物体之上存在更高层次的选择。

6 Darwin himself provides the best 19th century example — previously unrecognized because Darwin omitted this material, originally written for the unpublished "long version," from the Origin — of the need for a hierarchical theory of selection in any full account of the phenomenology of evolution. Entirely consistent single-level theories cannot be carried through to comple­tion. Darwin admitted important components of species selection in capping his (still unsatisfactory) explanation for an issue that he ranked second in im­portance only to explaining the anagenesis of populations by natural selec­tion: the resolution of organic variety and plenitude by a "principle of diver­gence" (his terminology). I document the largely unrecognized emphasis that he placed upon this principle of divergence (for example, the Origin's famous single figure does not illustrate natural selection, as generally misinterpreted, but rather the principle of divergence). Darwin struggled to explain this de­scriptively higher-level phenomenon of taxonomic diversification as a fully predictable consequence of ordinary organismal selection, but he could not proceed beyond an argument that he himself finally recognized as forced, and even a bit hokey: the claim that natural selection will always favor extreme variants at the tails of a distribution for a local population in a particular ecology (the Origin's diagram represents an exemplification of this claim). Eventually, Darwin realized that he needed to invoke species selection for a fell explanation of the success of speciose clades — and this unknown argument, rather than his well-documented defense of group selection for human altruism, represents Darwin's most generalized invocation of selection at supraorganismal levels.

达尔文本人在 19 世纪为我们提供了一个很好的例子，说明在完整描述进化现象时需要一个层级选择理论。这个例子之前未被人们认识到，因为达尔文在《物种起源》中省略了这部分原本为未发表的「长版」撰写的材料。单一层次的理论往往无法完整地解释进化现象。达尔文承认了物种选择的重要性，以此总结他对一个重要问题的解释。这个问题在他看来仅次于通过自然选择解释种群进化的问题，那就是通过他所说的「分歧原则」来解决有机体的多样性和丰富性。我记录了他对这个分歧原则的重视（例如，《物种起源》中的著名图示实际上并不是在说明自然选择，而是分歧原则）。达尔文努力将这种更高层次的分类学多样化现象解释为普通生物选择的可预测结果，但他最终承认这个论点有些牵强，甚至有点随意：他认为自然选择总是会偏好特定生态环境中种群分布极端的变体（《物种起源》的图示便是这个论点的例证）。最终，达尔文意识到需要通过物种选择来全面解释为何某些物种群更为成功。这一论点不为人知，相较于他为人类利他主义进行群体选择的已知辩护，更能代表达尔文在超越个体层面进行选择的普遍性思考。

7 Hierarchical models of evolutionary processes (at least descriptively so, but causally as well) have been featured and defended by evolutionary theo­rists from the beginning of our science, although not always by good or valid arguments. This inadequately recognized theme explains the major contrast between Lamarck and Darwin, and coordinates the various disputes between Wallace and Darwin. Wallace simply didn't grasp the concept of levels at all, and remained so committed to adaptationism that he ranged up and down the hierarchy, oblivious of the conceptual problems thus entailed, until he found a level to justify his adaptationist bent. Darwin, by contrast, com­pletely understood the problem of levels, and the reasons behind his strong preference for a reductionist and single-level theory of organismal agency — although he reluctantly admitted a need for species selection to resolve the problem of divergence. We can also understand why Wallace's 1858 Ternate paper, sent to Darwin and precipitating the "delicate arrangement," did not proceed as far to a resolution as later tradition holds, when we recognize Wallace's conceptual confusion about levels of selection.

进化过程的分层模型（至少是描述性的，同时也是因果性的）从科学创立初期就被进化论者强调和捍卫，尽管论据并不总是充分或有效。这一未被充分认识的主题解释了拉马克与达尔文之间的主要差异，并揭示了华莱士与达尔文之间的多种争论。华莱士完全没有理解层次概念，并如此坚持适应主义，以至于在层次间来回游走，对由此产生的概念问题视若无睹，直到他找到一个层次来支持其适应主义倾向。相反，达尔文完全理解层次问题，并强烈偏爱还原主义和单一层次的生物代理理论，尽管他勉强承认需要通过物种选择来解决分歧。我们也能理解为何华莱士 1858 年寄给达尔文的特尔纳特论文未能如后来的传统所认为的那样推进，当我们认识到华莱士在选择层次上的概念混乱时。

Chapter 4: Intemalism and laws of form: pre-darwinian alternatives

1 In a brilliant closing section to his general chapter 6, entitled "difficulties on theory," Darwin summarized the logical structure of the most important challenge to his system, and organized his most cogent defense for his func­tionalist theory of selection, by explicating the classical dichotomy between "unity of type" and "conditions of existence" — or the formalism of Geoffroy vs. the functionalism of Cuvier — entirely in selectionist terms, and to his ad­vantage. He attributed "conditions of existence" to immediate adaptation by natural selection, and then explicated "unity of type" as constraints of inheri­tance of homologous structures, originally evolved as adaptations in a distant ancestor. Thus, he identified natural selection as the underlying "higher law" for explaining all morphology as present adaptation or as constraint based on past adaptation. He also admitted, while cleverly restricting their range and frequency, a few other factors and forces in evolutionary explanation.

第 4 章：内在主义与形式法则：达尔文之前的替代理论

1 在他关于「理论的困难」的第 6 章的精彩结尾中，达尔文总结了对他理论的最大挑战的逻辑结构，并为他的功能主义选择理论提供了有力的辩护。他通过选择主义的视角解释了「类型统一」和「存在条件」这对经典二分法 —— 即 Geoffroy 的形式主义与 Cuvier 的功能主义 —— 并为此提供了有利的解释。他将「存在条件」视为自然选择带来的直接适应，并将「类型统一」解释为同源结构遗传的限制，这些结构最初是在遥远的祖先中为了适应环境而进化出来的。因此，他将自然选择视作解释所有形态学的基本「高级法则」，即其为当前的适应或是基于过去适应的限制提供了解释。他也承认，在巧妙地限制其范围和频率的同时，进化解释中还存在其他一些因素和力量。

2 A fascinating, and previously unexplored, contrast may be drawn be­tween the strikingly similar dichotomy, although rooted in creationist ex­planations, of Paley's functionalist and adaptationist theory of divine con­struction for individualized biomechanical optimality vs. Agassiz's formalist theory of divine ordination of taxonomic structure as an incarnation of God's thoughts according to "laws of form" reflecting modes and categories of eter­nal thought. Clearly, this ancient (and still continuing) contrast between structural and functional conceptions of morphology transcends and pre­dates any particular mechanism, even the supposedly primary contrast of cre­ation vs. evolution, proposed to explain the actual construction of organic di­versity.

一个有趣且曾未被深入探讨的对比可以在两个相似的理论之间展开。虽然这两个理论都源于创世论的解释，但它们各有不同。一个是 Paley 的理论，他提出功能主义和适应主义，认为神圣的设计是为了实现个体生物机械的最佳状态。另一个是 Agassiz 的理论，他认为物种的分类结构是神圣意志的呈现，反映了「形式法则」下神的永恒思想的模式和类别。显然，这种对形态结构与功能的古老（且仍在进行）的对比，超越并早于任何特定的机制，甚至是创世与进化这两种解释有机多样性起源的主要对比。

3 In the late 18th century, the great poet (and naturalist) Goethe developed a fascinating (and, in the light of modern discoveries in evo-devo, more than partly correct) archetypal theory in the structuralist or formalist mode — and explicitly critical of functionalist, teleological and adaptationist alternatives — for the diversity of organs growing off the stems and roots of plants. He viewed cotyledons, and all the standard parts of flowers (sepals, petals, stamens and carpels), as modifications of a leaf archetype.

18 世纪末，伟大的诗人兼博物学家 Goethe 在结构主义或形式主义的框架下，提出了一种引人入胜的原型理论。随着现代进化发育生物学（evo-devo）的发展，这一理论被部分证实是正确的。Goethe 明确批评了功能主义、目的论和适应主义的其他理论，用以解释植物茎和根所生长的器官的多样性。他认为，子叶以及花的所有标准部位（如萼片、花瓣、雄蕊和心皮）都是叶子原型的变体。

4 The famous early 19th century argument, culminating in the public debate of 1830 between Georges Cuvier and Etienne Geoffroy St. Hilaire (and analyzed by Goethe in his final paper before his death), did not, as com­monly misinterpreted, pit evolutionary theories against creationist accounts (although Geoffroy favored a limited theory of evolution, while Cuvier re­mained strongly opposed), but rather represented the most striking and en­during incident in this older and persistent struggle between formalist (Geoffroy) and functionalist (Cuvier) explanations of morphology and taxonomic order. Geoffroy advocated the abstract vertebra as an archetype for all animals, beginning (largely successfully) with a common basis for anatomical differences between teleosts and tetrapods, moving to the putatively common design of insects and vertebrates (still with some success, partly confirmed by the Hoxology of modern evo-devo, but also including some "howlers" like the homology of arthropod limbs with vertebrate ribs), and crashing with the proposed homology of vertebrates and a cephalopod doubled back upon it­self (the comparison that sufficiently aroused Cuvier's growing ire into a call for public debate). Geoffroy's theory of dorsoventral inversion between insects and vertebrates was not a silly evolutionary conjecture about "the worm that turned" (as later caricatures often portray), and did not represent an evolutionary explanation at all, but rather expressed a formalist comparison based upon a common underlying structure, ecologically oriented one way in vertebrates (central nervous system up), and the other way in arthropods. The common impression of Cuvier's victory must be reassessed as a complex "draw," with Geoffroy's position abetted by the fortuity of his longer life and his courting of prominent literary friends as supporters (including Balzac and Georges Sand).

19 世纪初的一场著名争论在 1830 年达到了高潮，Georges Cuvier 和 Etienne Geoffroy St. Hilaire 之间的公开辩论，并不像通常被误解的那样，将进化理论与创世论对立起来（尽管 Geoffroy 支持有限的进化理论，而 Cuvier 坚决反对）。实际上，这场辩论代表了形式主义（Geoffroy）与功能主义（Cuvier）在形态学和分类次序解释上的持久争斗中最为引人注目的事件。Geoffroy 主张将脊椎骨视为所有动物的原型，起初（相对成功地）为硬骨鱼和四足动物之间的解剖差异提供了共同基础，接着研究昆虫和脊椎动物的假设共同设计（部分成功，现代进化发育生物学的 Hoxology 也在某种程度上证实了这一点，但也出现了一些明显错误，例如将节肢动物肢体与脊椎动物肋骨同源）。然而，当他提出脊椎动物与一种反复缠绕自己的头足类动物的同源性时，却遭遇了失败（这一主张激怒了 Cuvier，促使他要求进行公开辩论）。Geoffroy 关于昆虫和脊椎动物背腹反转的理论，并不是后人讽刺的「翻转的蠕虫」那样的进化推测，而是基于生态差异的形式主义比较，脊椎动物中枢神经系统向上，而节肢动物则相反。对于 Cuvier 胜利的普遍印象需要重新评估为一个复杂的「平局」，Geoffroy 的立场因他的长寿和与著名文学朋友（如 Balzac 和 Georges Sand）的交往而得到支持。

5 Adaptationist preferences have enjoyed a long anglophonic tradition, beginning with the treatises of Ray and Boyle, in Newton's founding genera­tion, on final causes; then extending, in creationist terms, through Paley and the Bridgewater Treatises; and finally culminating in the radically reversed evolutionary explanations (but still retaining the same functionalist and adaptationist commitments) of Darwin, extending forward to Fisher and the Modern Synthesis. By contrast, continental traditions have favored formalist and structuralist explanations of morphology, from the creationist accounts of Agassiz, through the transitional systems of Goethe and Geoffroy, to the fully evolutionary accounts of Goldschmidt and Schindewolf in the mid 20th century. Interestingly, the complex views of Richard Owen, so widely misun­derstood as an opponent of evolution (when he only rejected the predomi­nant functionalism of traditional British approaches to morphology), may best be grasped when we understand him as a rare anglophonic exponent of a predominantly formalist theory. Owen, following Geoffroy, tried to explain the entire vertebrate skeleton, including the skull and limbs, as a set of modi­fications upon a vertebral archetype.

适应主义的偏好在英语世界有着悠久的历史。这可以追溯到 Ray 和 Boyle 在牛顿时代关于「最终目的」的研究。随后，这种思想在创世论者如 Paley 和 Bridgewater 的论文中得到了延续，并在达尔文的进化理论中达到了一个新的高度，尽管达尔文的理论在形式上发生了彻底的变化，但仍然保持了功能主义和适应主义的核心理念。这种传统继续发展，影响了 Fisher 和现代综合理论的形成。相较之下，大陆学术界更倾向于从形式主义和结构主义的角度解释生物形态学，从 Agassiz 的创世论，到 Goethe 和 Geoffroy 的过渡理论，再到 20 世纪中期 Goldschmidt 和 Schindewolf 的进化论述。值得注意的是，Richard Owen 的观点常被误解为反对进化论，但实际上，他只是反对传统英国形态学中的功能主义。他是少数支持形式主义理论的英语学者之一，受 Geoffroy 的影响，Owen 试图将脊椎动物的骨架，包括头骨和四肢，解释为基于脊椎基本结构的变化。

6 Darwin maintained a genuine interest in formalist constraints upon adaptationist optimality for individualized features of anatomy — a theme that he epitomized as "correlations of growth." But he developed an explicit framework and rationale, most thoroughly discussed not in the Origin but in his longest 1868 book on The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Do­mestication, that relegated such formalist effects to a clearly subservient and secondary status, compared with natural selection and adaptation, in evolu­tionary causality.

达尔文对形式主义在个体解剖特征适应性优化中的作用表现出了浓厚的兴趣，他将这一主题称为「生长的相关性」。然而，他在 1868 年出版的《家养动植物的变异》一书中，发展出一个明确的框架和理论依据。达尔文在书中详细讨论了这些形式主义效应，并认为它们在进化的因果关系中，相对于自然选择和适应的重要性，是从属且次要的。这一讨论比他在《物种起源》中的论述更为详尽。

Chapter 5: Channels and saltations in post-Darwinian formalism

1 Galton's Polyhedron, the metaphor and model devised by Darwin's bril­liant and eccentric cousin Francis Galton, and then fruitfully used by many evolutionary critics of Darwinism, including St. George Mivart, W. K. Brooks, Hugo de Vries, and Richard Goldschmidt, clearly expresses the two great, and both logically and historically conjoined, themes of formalist (or structuralist, or internalist, in other terminologies) challenges to functionalist (or adaptationist, or externalist) theories in the Darwinian tradition. This model of evolution by facet-flipping to limited possibilities of adjacent planes in inherited structure stresses the two themes — channels set by internal con­straint, and evolutionary transition by discontinuous saltation — that struc­turalist alternatives tend to embrace and that pure Darwinism must combat as challenges to basic components of its essential logic (for channels direct the pathways of evolutionary change from the inside, albeit in potentially posi­tive and adaptive ways, even though some external force, like natural selection, may be required as an initiating impulse; whereas saltational change violates the Darwinian requirement for selection's creativity by vesting the scope and direction of change in the nature and magnitude of internal jumps, and not in sequences of adaptive accumulations mediated by natural selection at each step).

第 5 章：后达尔文主义形式主义中的通道与突变

1 Galton 的多面体是由达尔文的杰出而古怪的表亲 Francis Galton 设计的一个隐喻和模型。这个模型后来被许多批评达尔文主义的进化论者所采纳，包括 St. George Mivart、W. K. Brooks、Hugo de Vries 和 Richard Goldschmidt。这一模型清晰地表达了形式主义（又称结构主义或内部主义）对达尔文传统中功能主义（也称适应主义或外部主义）理论的挑战。Galton 的模型通过翻转继承结构中相邻平面的有限可能性来解释进化，强调了两个主题：一是由内部限制设置的通道，二是通过不连续的突变实现的进化过渡。这两个主题是结构主义替代理论倾向接受的，而纯粹的达尔文主义则必须面对这些作为其基本逻辑的挑战。通道从内部引导进化变化的路径，尽管可能是积极和适应的方式，但通常需要外部力量如自然选择作为初始推动力。而突变则通过内部跳跃的性质和幅度影响变化的范围和方向，这种跃变不依赖每一步都通过自然选择中介的适应性积累序列，从而挑战达尔文主义关于选择的创造性要求。

2 Orthogenesis, as a general term for evolutionary directionality along channels of internal constraint, rather than external pathways of natural se­lection, existed in several versions, ranging from helpful auxiliaries to Dar­winism, to outright alternatives that denied any creative potency to selection. Theodor Eimer, who coined the term orthogenesis, presented a middle ver­sion that tried to integrate internal channels of orthogenesis with external pathways of functionalist determination. But Eimer defended Lamarckian mechanics for his functionalism, thus leading him to oppose natural selection (he spoke of the Ohnmacht, or "without power," of selection, contrasted with Weismann's Allmacht, or "all power") despite his pluralistic linkage of formalist and functionalist explanations.

正向演化（Orthogenesis）是一个用来描述进化方向性通过内部约束来实现，而不是依赖外部自然选择的术语。这个概念有多个版本，从作为达尔文主义的有益补充，到彻底否定自然选择具有创造性力量的替代理论都有。Theodor Eimer 是正向演化这一术语的创造者，他提出了一种中间观点，试图将正向演化的内部机制与功能主义的外部路径结合。然而，Eimer 支持通过拉马克主义的机制来解释功能主义，这使得他反对自然选择。他称自然选择为 Ohnmacht（即「无力」），与 Weismann 的 Allmacht（即「全能」）形成对比，尽管他在解释中尝试结合形式主义和功能主义的观点。

3 The orthogenetic theory of the late 19th century American paleontolo­gist Alpheus Hyatt embodied maximal opposition to natural selection, and must be viewed as alternative, rather than auxiliary, to Darwinism. Hyatt conceived the pathway of ontogeny, modified only by heterochronic changes permitted under the biogenetic law, as the internal directing channel that nat­ural selection could tweak, but not derail. Illustrating the influence of theory over perception, Hyatt found several parallel lineages of snails, running along different segments of a common pathway, but all supposedly living in an identical environment — where others had reconstructed typical Darwinian monophyletic trees of phylogeny from the same stratigraphic section of fresh­water planorbids. Hyatt, who engaged in a long and ultimately frustrating correspondence with Darwin on this subject, believed that lineages followed a preordained "ontogeny" of phyletic youth, maturity and old age, thus at­tributing the different internal responses of lineages living in the same envi­ronment to their residence in different stages of an ontogenetically fixed and shared phyletic pathway (a preset internal channel with a vengeance).

19 世纪晚期，美国古生物学家 Alpheus Hyatt 的正向发生理论与自然选择理论对立，应被视为达尔文主义的替代品，而不是辅助品。Hyatt 将受生物遗传法则允许的异时性变化影响的个体发育路径视为自然选择可以微调但无法改变的内部指导通道。为了说明理论对感知的影响，Hyatt 发现了一些平行的蜗牛谱系，这些谱系沿着共同路径的不同部分运行，但都假设生活在相同的环境中 —— 而其他人在相同的淡水盘蜗牛地层中重建了典型的达尔文单系发生树。他与达尔文进行了漫长而最终令人沮丧的通信，Hyatt 认为这些谱系遵循一个预定的「谱系发育」过程，包括谱系的青年期、成熟期和老年期，因此他认为生活在相同环境中的谱系，其不同的内部反应，是因为它们处于一个预定且固定的共同谱系路径的不同阶段。

4 Charles Otis Whitman, a great early 20th century American naturalist, developed the most congenial auxiliary theory (to Darwinism) of ortho­genesis in his extensive work on the evolution of color patterns in Darwin's own favorite organism, the domestic pigeon. Whitman argued that domestic pigeons in particular, and dove-like birds in general, followed a strong chan­nel of internal predisposition leading in one direction from checkers to bars, and eventually to the obliteration of all color. (Darwin, by interesting con­trast, argued for a reverse tendency from bars to checkers, but also held, as his basic theory obviously implies, that selection largely determines any par­ticular event and that no internal predisposition can trump the dictates of im­mediate function.)

查尔斯·奥蒂斯·惠特曼（Charles Otis Whitman）是 20 世纪初期一位杰出的美国博物学家，他在研究达尔文钟爱的家鸽色彩图案演变时，提出了一种与达尔文主义相辅相成的理论，即「正向进化」。惠特曼认为，家鸽和类似鸽子的鸟类，具有一种强烈的内在倾向，从方格图案演变为条纹图案，最终颜色逐渐消失。而达尔文则认为，趋势是从条纹到方格，但他也认为，选择在很大程度上决定了每一个事件的发展，瞬时的功能需求往往胜过内在倾向。

5 In his 1894 book on Materials for the Study of Variation (where he coined the term homeosis), William Bateson presented an extensive catalog of cases in discontinuous variation among individuals in a population and be­tween populations of closely related organisms. He used these examples to develop a formalist theory of saltational evolution, strongly opposed to the adaptationist assumptions of Darwinian accounts. (Bateson's acerbic criti­cisms of adaptationist scenario-building and story-telling in the speculative mode emphasize a common linkage between structuralist preferences for me­chanical explanation, and distaste for the adaptationist assumption that func­tional necessity leads and the evolution of form follows.) Although Bateson coined the term genetics, his personal commitment to a "vibratory" theory of heredity, based on physical laws of classical mechanics — an intuition that he could never "cash out" as a testable theory — prevented his allegiance to the growing influence of Mendelian principles.

在 1894 年，William Bateson 在他的著作《变异研究材料》中首次提出了「homeosis」这个术语，并列出了一份关于种群中个体之间以及密切相关生物群体之间不连续变异的详细目录。他利用这些例子发展了一种形式化的跳跃性进化理论，这种理论与达尔文进化论中的适应假说有很大的不同。Bateson 尖锐地批评了以推测方式构建的适应情景和故事，强调了结构主义者偏好机械解释，而对认为功能需求决定形态进化的适应假说表示反感。虽然 Bateson 创造了「遗传学」这个词，但由于他个人坚持一种基于经典力学物理定律的「振动」遗传理论 —— 一种他始终无法形成可检验理论的直觉 —— 这使得他无法完全接受孟德尔遗传原则的影响。

6 Hugo de Vries, the brilliant Dutch botanist who understood the logic of selectionism so thoroughly and acutely (but largely in contrast with the only other biologists, Weismann and Darwin himself, who also grasped all the richness and range of implications, but with favor), developed a saltational theory of evolution, but explicitly denied any predisposition of lineages to follow internal channels of constraint. (He thus showed the potential inde­pendence of the frequently linked formalist themes of channeling and salta­tion, a conjunction espoused by Bateson and Goldschmidt for example, but denied in the other direction by Whitman, who favored channeling but de­nied saltation by supporting a gradualist theory of orthogenetic change.) This fascinating scholar regarded Darwin as his intellectual hero and never forgot the kindness and encouragement conveyed by his mentor and guru during their one personal meeting early in de Vries's career. But de Vries, who devel­oped the theory of intracellular pangenesis (the ultimate source for the term "gene") in the late 19th century, and then (quite fortuitously and long after he had reached saltational conclusions for other reasons) became one of Men­del's rediscoverers, based his truly saltational theory of immediate macromutational origin of species on his work with the evening primrose, Oenothera lamarckiana, where he mistook an odd chromosomal organization that gen­erates occasional saltations for a biological generality. De Vries, who under­stood the logic of selectionism so well, who knew that his macromutational theory refuted several essential components of Darwinian logic, but who could not bear (for largely psychological reasons) to forsake his intellectual and personal hero, insisted upon his larger fealty to Darwin, even though he had banned Darwinian mechanisms from the master's own realm of the ori­gin of species. So de Vries developed a hierarchical theory that, while denying selection for the origin of species, restored selectionist logic at the higher level of phyletic trends by explicitly proposing "species selection" (his term) as a mechanism for generating broader phylogenetic patterns.

6 Hugo de Vries 是一位杰出的荷兰植物学家，他对选择论（Selectionism）的逻辑有着深刻的理解，但与其他生物学家如 Weismann 和 Darwin 本人不同，他发展了一种跳跃论的进化理论，同时明确否认任何生物谱系会遵循内部约束的路径。这表明了形式主义中常被联系在一起的引导和跳跃主题的潜在独立性，这种结合在 Bateson 和 Goldschmidt 等人中很常见，但 Whitman 却持相反的观点，他支持引导但否认跳跃，提倡一种渐进的正向进化理论。de Vries 将 Darwin 视作他的智力偶像，并始终铭记在职业生涯初期与这位导师和精神导师一次见面时所获得的善意和鼓励。然而，de Vries 在 19 世纪后期发展了细胞内泛生论理论（这个理论最终为「基因」一词的来源），并且在机缘巧合下成为了 Mendel 的重新发现者之一。基于他对晚樱草（Oenothera lamarckiana）的研究，他提出了一种真正的跳跃论，即物种通过直接的大突变而起源的理论，尽管他误将这种奇特的染色体组织视为普遍的生物现象。de Vries 深谙选择论的逻辑，虽然他的宏大突变理论挑战了达尔文逻辑中的几个基本要素，但出于心理上的原因，他无法放弃对这位智力和个人偶像的忠诚。因此，de Vries 发展出一种分层理论，尽管他否认选择在物种起源中的作用，但通过提出「物种选择」（他本人提出的术语）作为一种生成更广泛系统发生模式的机制，重新在更高层次的系统发育趋势中恢复了选择论的逻辑。

7 By proposing a comprehensive formalist theory in the heyday of developing Darwinian orthodoxy, Richard Goldschmidt became the whipping boy of the Modern Synthesis — and for entirely understandable reasons. Gold­schmidt showed his grasp, and his keen ability to utilize, microevolutionary theory by supporting this approach and philosophy in his work on variation and intraspecific evolution within the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar. But he then expressed his apostasy by advocating discontinuity of causality, and pro­posing a largely nonselectionist and formalist account for macroevolution from the origin of species to higher levels of phyletic pattern. Goldschmidt in­tegrated both themes of saltation (in his concept of "systemic mutation" based on his increasingly lonely, and ultimately indefensible, battle to deny the corpuscular gene) and channeling (in his more famous, if ridiculed, idea of "hopeful monsters," or macromutants channeled along viable lines set by internal pathways of ontogeny, sexual differences, etc.). The developmental theme of the "hopeful monster" (despite its inappropriate name, virtually guaranteed to inspire ridicule and opposition), based on the important con­cept of "rate genes," came first in Goldschmidt's thought, and always occu­pied more of his attention and research. Unfortunately, he bound this inter­esting challenge from development, a partially valid concept that could have been incorporated into a Darwinian framework as an auxiliary hypothesis (and now has been accepted, to a large extent, if under different names), to his truly oppositional and ultimately incorrect theory of systemic mutation, therefore winning anathema for his entire system. Goldschmidt may have acted as the architect of his own undoing, but much of his work should evoke sympathetic attention today.

在达尔文正统理论快速发展的时期，Richard Goldschmidt 提出了一种全面的形式主义理论，因而成为现代综合理论的替罪羊，这也不难理解。Goldschmidt 展示了他对微观进化理论的深刻理解和应用能力，特别是在他关于舞毒蛾（Lymantria dispar）的变异和种内进化研究中。然而，他后来提出了与主流观点相悖的观点，认为宏观进化从物种起源到更高层次的谱系模式之间存在因果关系的不连续性，并提出了一种主要非选择性的形式主义解释。Goldschmidt 将「跃变」（在他的「系统突变」概念中体现，这基于他孤立且最终无法支撑的否认基因粒子的斗争）和「引导」（在他更为著名且常被嘲笑的「有希望的怪物」概念中，这些是沿着个体发育、性别差异等内部路径导向的巨型突变体）结合在一起。尽管「有希望的怪物」这个名词容易招致嘲笑和反对，它基于「速率基因」这一重要概念，最先出现在 Goldschmidt 的思想中，并且一直是他研究的重点。不幸的是，他将这个源于发展的有趣挑战（这一部分合理的概念本可以作为辅助假说纳入达尔文框架，现在也在某种程度上被接受，虽然名字不同）与他真正对立且最终错误的系统突变理论结合在一起，因此他的整个理论体系受到诟病。Goldschmidt 可能是自我失败的设计者，但他的大部分工作在今天应该得到更多的同情和关注。

Chapter 6: Pattern and progress on the geological stage

1 Darwin based his argument for a broad and general vector of progress in life's history not on the "bare bones" operation of natural selection (where he had explicitly denied such an outcome as the most radical implication of his theory), but on subsidiary ecological claims for the predominance of biotic over abiotic competition, and for a geological history of plenitude in a persis­tently crowded ecological world, where one species must displace another to gain entry into ecosystems (the metaphor of the wedge). Darwin used these ecological sequelae, along with the gradualist and incrementalist logic of natural selection itself, as primary justifications for his third essential claim of selection's scope, or the uniformitarian extension of small-scale microevolution, in a smoothly continuationist manner, to explain all patterns of macro-evolution by accumulation of increments through the immensity of geological time.

第六章：地质舞台上的模式与进展

1 达尔文并不是通过自然选择的基础操作来论证生命历史中的广泛进程（他明确否认这是其理论中最极端的含义），而是通过次要的生态学主张。他提出生物竞争优于非生物竞争，并认为地质历史中生态系统总是处于拥挤状态。在这种情况下，一个物种必须通过取代另一个物种才能进入生态系统，这被称为「楔子」的隐喻。达尔文利用这些生态后果，以及自然选择的渐进和递增逻辑，作为其选择范围的第三个关键主张的主要依据。他认为，通过小规模微进化的均匀扩展，可以用一种平稳、连续的方式，通过漫长的地质时间积累增量，以解释所有宏观进化的模式。

2 Such a claim requires that the geological stage operate in an appropri­ate, and "Goldilockean," manner — not too much change to debar the opera­tion and domination of this slowly and smoothly accumulative biological mode, and not too little to provide insufficient impetus (within Darwin's externalist and functionalist theory) for attributing the amount of change ac­tually observed to natural selection.

这样的观点要求地质阶段的变化要恰到好处 —— 不能过于剧烈，以免阻碍这种缓慢而稳定积累的生物模式的运作和主导；也不能过于微小，因为在达尔文的理论中，需要足够的变化来支持自然选择可以解释我们实际观察到的变化。

3 The primary claim of "too much" derived from the school of "catastrophism" in geology — a movement that has been unfairly stigmatized by later history, following Lyell's successful and largely rhetorical mischaracterization (he was a lawyer by profession), as an unscientific defense of super-naturalism to cram the observed results of geology into the strictures of bibli­cal chronology, but that actually took the opposite position of strict empirical literalism (whereas uniformitarians argued that the numerous literal appear­ances of rapidity in the geological record must be "interpreted" as misleading consequences of how gradual change must be expressed in a woefully imper­fect set of strata). The great catastrophist Cuvier, in particular, was an En­lightenment rationalist, not a theological apologist — and he based his defense of catastrophism upon his literalist reading of the paleontological and geolog­ical record.

「过多」的观点源于地质学中的「灾变论」学派。灾变论在历史上由于 Lyell（他是一名律师）成功的修辞误导而被误解，甚至被视为一种不科学的超自然主义辩护，试图将地质学的观测结果硬套进圣经的时间框架。然而，灾变论实际上强调的是严格的经验主义，而非超自然解释。相反，均变论者认为地质记录中看似快速的变化只是渐进变化在不完整地层中的误导性表现。特别是著名的灾变论者 Cuvier，并非神学辩护者，而是一位启蒙时代的理性主义者。他基于对古生物学和地质学记录的字面解读来支持灾变论。

4 The primary claim of "too little" geology followed Lord Kelvin's increasingly diminished estimates for the age of the earth (incorrectly made — although Kelvin accurately described the necessary, but (as it turned out) empirically false, logic required to validate his views — by assuming that heat now flowing from the earth represented a continuing loss from an originally molten state). Darwin worried intensely over Kelvin's claims, even referring to him as an "odious spectre" in a letter to Wallace. Darwin feared that Kel­vin's low estimates would not permit enough time to generate the history of fife under his slowly acting theory of gradualistic and accumulative change. Although this story has been told often, and has become familiar to scientists, an important (and decisive) aspect of the tale has rarely been exposed: Darwin fought this battle alone, and his strong distress illustrates the maximal, and unique, extent of his gradualistic and continuationist commitments. His closest colleagues, Wallace and Huxley, did not find Kelvin's low estimates unacceptable, but argued that we had only been led to expect such slow change from our previous conception of the earth's age, and that faster rates of phyletic change, implied by Kelvin's dates, were entirely acceptable under their reading of evolution.

「太少」地质学的主要论点是基于 Lord Kelvin 对地球年龄的估计不断减少的结果（尽管 Kelvin 准确描述了验证其观点所需的逻辑，但这种逻辑被证明经验上是错误的 —— 他假设地球目前散发的热量是从最初的熔融状态持续损失的结果）。达尔文对此深感担忧，甚至在写给 Wallace 的信中称 Kelvin 为「可憎的幽灵」。达尔文担心 Kelvin 的低估计无法提供足够的时间来支持他的缓慢累积变化理论解释生命的历史。虽然这个故事常被提及，科学家们也很熟悉，但其中一个重要且决定性的方面很少被揭示：达尔文独自面对这场挑战，他的深度不安反映了他对渐进和持续变化理论的坚定和独特的承诺。他的亲密同事 Wallace 和 Huxley 并不认为 Kelvin 的低估计不可接受，他们认为我们只是因为之前对地球年龄的看法才预期变化会如此缓慢，而根据他们对进化的理解，Kelvin 所暗示的更快的谱系变化速度是可以接受的。

Chapter 7: The modern synthesis as a limited consensus

1 From the anarchic situation that prevailed at the Darwinian centennial celebrations of 1909 (confidence in the factuality of evolution, linked with agnosticism about theories and mechanics, as the first fruits of Mendelism seemed, initially, to refute the gradualism and incrementalism of natural se­lection), the Modern Synthesis eventually emerged in two stages (following the union of Darwinian and Mendelian perspectives in the work of Fisher and others): first, by a welcome restriction that eliminated Kellogg's three al­ternatives in oppositional modes that would have destroyed Darwinism (Lamarckism as a substitute functionalism, and saltationism and orthogene­sis as formalist alternatives), and reasserted, now in a context of Mendelian particulate inheritance, the adequacy of natural selection as a creative force; and second, by an increasingly dubious hardening, culminating in centennial celebrations for the Origin in 1959, that substituted an increasingly rigid adaptationism for an earlier pluralism that embraced all mechanisms (includ­ing genetic drift) consistent with known genetic principles, while favoring se­lection as a primary force.

1909 年达尔文百年庆典上，科学界对进化的事实性充满信心，但对其理论和机制持不可知态度，因为孟德尔主义的出现似乎最初挑战了自然选择的渐进性和增量性。随着时间的推移，现代综合理论逐渐形成，分为两个阶段（结合了费舍尔和其他人对达尔文和孟德尔观点的统一）。首先，科学界通过限制消除了凯洛格提出的三种对立的替代方案，这些替代方案可能会摧毁达尔文主义（包括将拉马克主义作为功能主义的替代，以及跃迁论和正向发生论作为形式主义的选择）。在孟德尔粒子遗传理论的支持下，自然选择被重新确认具有创造性力量的充分性。其次，随着时间的推移，科学界对自然选择的强调逐渐变得更为坚定，并在 1959 年《物种起源》百年庆典达到顶点，这种强调取代了早期包容所有与已知遗传原则一致的机制（如遗传漂变）的多元化，选择被视为主要的驱动力。

2 In his founding book of 1930, The Genetical Theory of Natural Selec­tion, R. A. Fisher showed how slow, gradualist evolution in large, panmictic populations (treated almost as an ahistorical system, analogous to effectively infinite populations of identical gas molecules free to move and diffuse by physical principles) could validate strict Darwinism under Mendelian partic­ulate inheritance (with Darwin's own acceptance of blending inheritance ex­posed as a more serious impediment than Darwin himself had realized), and disprove saltational alternatives by the inverse correlation of frequency and magnitude in variation. To these mathematical and general chapters, Fisher appended a long closing section devoted to his eugenical theory that Western society had begun to degenerate seriously as a consequence of the social pro­motion of infertility (the rise in class level of "good" genetic stock, largely by their correlated tendency to have fewer children, thereby husbanding their economic resources to potentiate their social elevation). Fisher conceived this eugenical "blight" as entirely Darwinian in character — invisible in its gradual expression generation by generation, but ultimately more deadly than the ex­plicit saltational degenerations stressed by most eugenicists.

在 1930 年，R. A. Fisher 在他的奠基性著作《自然选择的遗传学理论》中展示了一个理论，即在大型随机交配的群体中，通过缓慢而渐进的进化过程，可以在孟德尔粒子遗传的框架下支持严格的达尔文主义。达尔文曾接受混合遗传，但 Fisher 证明这其实是个更大的障碍。他还通过研究变异的频率和幅度之间的反比关系，反驳了突变式进化的理论。在书的后半部分，Fisher 详细论述了他的优生学理论。他认为，西方社会因推崇不育而开始退化，这种现象与「良好」基因群体因倾向减少生育而提升社会地位有关。Fisher 认为这种社会问题是隐蔽的、逐渐发展的，虽然不易察觉，但最终比其他优生学家所担忧的显性突变退化更为严重。

3 In contrast with the initial pluralism of Haldane and Huxley (in the book that coined the Modern Synthesis), and of the first editions of founding documents for the second phase of the Synthesis (Dobzhansky's 1937 Genet­ics and the Origin of Species, Mayr's 1942 Systematics and the Origin of Spe­cies, and Simpson's 1944 Tempo and Mode in Evolution), later editions of these three documents encapsulated the hardening of this second phase, as initial pluralism yielded to an increasingly firm and exclusive commitment to adaptationist scenarios, and to natural selection as a virtually exclusive mech­anism of change. Even Sewall Wright's views on genetic drift and shifting balance altered from initial stress upon stochastic alternatives to selection to an auxiliary role for drift (as an impetus for the exploration of new, and poten­tially higher, adaptive peaks) as one aspect of a more inclusive and basically adaptationist process. The complex reasons for this hardening include some empirical documentations of selection, but also involve a set of basically so­cial and institutional factors not based on increasing factual adequacy.

与 Haldane 和 Huxley 在现代综合理论一书中所提到的初始多元思想不同，第二阶段综合理论的创始文件（包括 Dobzhansky 的 1937 年《遗传学与物种起源》、Mayr 的 1942 年《系统学与物种起源》以及 Simpson 的 1944 年《进化的速度和模式》的初版）在后续版本中体现出了这一阶段的收紧。这种收紧体现在最初的多元思想逐渐被对适应主义方案的坚定和排他性的承诺所取代，自然选择也被视为几乎唯一的变化机制。即便是 Sewall Wright 对遗传漂变和转变平衡的观点，也从强调随机替代选择转变为将漂变视为一种辅助角色，推动探索新的、更高的适应性峰值。这种收紧的原因既包括了一些对选择的实证验证，也涉及一些基本上是社会和制度的因素，而不是因为事实的准确性增加。

4 If this hardening on the second Darwinian branch of selection's efficacy reflects a general trend within evolutionary theory, then we should find a sim­ilar Darwinian strengthening (and narrowing) on the other two branches of selection's agency (organismal vs. higher levels) and scope (adequacy to ex­plain the entire geological record by extrapolated microevolution). The tri­umph (for good reasons at the time) of Williams over Wynne-Edwards af­firms this trend for agency, although Williams's important clarification then unfortunately hardened (among epigones) into a dogmatic and a priori re­jection of any hint of group selection. Similarly, the Synthesis's increasing confidence in the exclusivity of gradualistic microevolution deprived paleon­tology of any independent theoretical space, and relegated the field to docu­mentation of an admittedly underdetermined pageant, built by the exclusive agency of microevolutionary principles. Several synthesists even denied the efficacy of differential speciation as an input to macroevolutionary pattern (branding the speciosity of some clades as a "luxury" rather than a crucial in­put to survival and flourishing), and attributed all higher-level change to extensions of gradualistic and adaptive anagenesis within unbranched lineages.

如果在选择效力的第二达尔文分支上的这种强化反映了进化理论中的普遍趋势，那么我们应该在选择的其他两个分支上（即生物个体与更高层次的选择）以及在解释整个地质记录的能力（通过微进化的外推）上发现类似的达尔文式强化（和收缩）。Williams 在当时（基于充分的理由）击败了 Wynne-Edwards，这证明了选择代理的这种趋势。然而，Williams 的重要澄清在随后的追随者中不幸地僵化，导致他们教条式地、先验地拒绝任何群体选择的可能性。同样，综合理论对渐进微观进化的排他性愈加自信，剥夺了古生物学的任何独立理论空间，并使其仅仅成为记录一个不确定的盛会，该盛会完全由微观进化原则构建。几位综合理论的支持者甚至否认差异化物种形成对宏观进化模式的作用，认为某些类群的物种多样性是「奢侈」而非生存和繁荣的关键因素，并将所有更高层次的变化归因于在无分支谱系内的渐进和适应性进化的扩展。

5 The trends to development, initial pluralism and later hardening of the Modern Synthesis win clearest expression in two sources of data: comparison of statements by leading scientists at the two contrasting centennial cele­brations of 1909 and 1959 (for Darwin's birth and for the publication of the Origin); and by documentation of hardening in the summary statements (and increasingly dogmatic dismissal of alternatives) in leading textbooks for sec­ondary and undergraduate courses in biology.

20 世纪现代综合论的发展趋势，从最初的多元化逐渐走向固化，最清晰地体现在两个数据来源：首先是通过对比 1909 年和 1959 年两次截然不同的百年庆典（分别纪念达尔文诞辰和《物种起源》发表）上著名科学家的陈述；其次是通过文献记录，在中学和大学本科生物学课程的主要教材中总结陈述的固化，以及对替代理论的日益教条化的排斥。

Chapter 8: Species as individuals in the hierarchical theory of selection

1 Selectionist mechanics, in the most abstract and general formulation, work by interaction of individuals and environments (broadly construed to include all biotic and abiotic elements), such that some individuals secure dif­ferential reproductive success as a consequence of higher fitness conferred by some of their distinctive features, leading to differential plurifaction of indi­viduals with these features (relative to other individuals with contrasting fea­tures), thus gradually transforming the population in adaptive ways. But the logic of this statement implies that organisms cannot be the only bio­logical entities that manifest the requisite properties of Darwinian individual­ity — properties that include both vernacular criteria (definite birth and death points, sufficient stability during a lifetime, to distinguish true entities from unboundable segments of continua), and more specifically Darwinian criteria (production of daughters, and inheritance of parental traits by daughters). In particular, and by these criteria, species must be construed not only as classes (as traditionally conceived), but also as distinct historical entities acting as good Darwinian individuals — and therefore potentially subject to selection. In fact, a full genealogical hierarchy of inclusion — with rising levels of genes, cell lineages, organisms, demes, species and clades — features clearly definable Darwinian individuals, subject to processes of selection, at each level, thus validating (in logic and theory, but not necessarily in the potency of actual practice in nature) an extension and reformulation of Darwin's exclusively organismal theory into a fully hierarchical theory of selection.

第八章：作为选择层级理论中的个体的物种

1 选择机制在其最抽象和一般的形式中，是通过个体与环境（广义上包括所有生物和非生物元素）的相互作用来实现的。在这种机制下，由于某些独特特征赋予的一些个体更高的适应性，它们能够获得不同的繁殖成功。这就导致这些特征的个体相较于具有不同特征的其他个体有更多的繁殖机会，从而逐渐使种群在适应性上发生变化。然而，这一逻辑表明，有机体并不是唯一能够展现达尔文个体性质的生物实体。达尔文个体的性质包括一般标准（明确的生命起点和终点，以及在生命期内的稳定性，以区分真实的个体与不可界定的连续体片段）和更具体的达尔文标准（子代的产生及其对父母特征的继承）。特别是，根据这些标准，物种不仅应被视为类别（传统观念），还应被视为独立的历史实体，作为良好的达尔文个体进行作用，因此可能受到选择的影响。事实上，一个完整的谱系层级，包括基因、细胞谱系、有机体、亚群、物种和谱系，在每个层级上都能清晰地看到达尔文个体，这些个体受到选择过程的影响。这验证了在逻辑和理论上，将达尔文仅限于有机体的理论扩展并改造为一个完整的层级选择理论。

2 The validity of the "interactor approach" to defining the mechanics of selection, and the fallacy of the "replicator approach" expose, as logically in­valid, all modern attempts to preserve Darwinian exclusivity of level, but to offer an even more reductionistic account in terms of genes, rather than or­ganisms, as agents — with organisms construed as passive containers for the genes that operate as exclusive agents of natural selection. This false argu­ment, based upon the true but irrelevant identification of genes as faithful replicators, must be replaced by the conceptually opposite formulation of a hierarchical theory of selection, with genes identified as only one valid, and lowest, level in a hierarchy of equally potent, and interestingly different, lev­els of Darwinian individuality: genes, cell lineages, organisms, demes, species and clades. Replication identifies a valid and important criterion for the cru­cial task of bookkeeping or tracing evolutionary change; but replicators can­not specify the causality of selectionist processes, which must be based upon the recognition and definition of interactors with environments. Even Wil­liams and Dawkins, the two leading exponents of exclusive gene selectionism, have acknowledged and properly described the hierarchical causality of inter­action (while proferring increasingly elaborate and implausible verbal de­fenses of gene selection in arguments about parallel hierarchies and Necker cubing of legitimate alternatives rooted in criteria of replication vs. interac­tion). Thus, Williams and Dawkins seem to grasp the validity of hierarchical selection through a glass darkly, while still trying explicitly to defend their in­creasingly indefensible preferences for exclusive gene selectionism.

「交互者方法」强调定义选择机制的合理性，而「复制者方法」的谬误在于，这种方法在逻辑上是不成立的。现代一些试图强调达尔文选择层次独特性的理论，往往提供了一种偏向基因的还原主义解释，即将生物体视为基因的被动载体，而基因则被认为是自然选择的唯一推动者。这种论点虽然基于基因作为忠实复制者的事实，但却无关紧要，因而需要被一种层次选择理论取代。在这种理论中，基因只是达尔文个体多层次体系中最低的一个层次，其他层次还包括细胞谱系、生物体、种群、物种和类群。虽然复制是追踪进化变化的重要标准，但复制者无法解释选择过程的因果关系，必须通过识别和定义与环境相互作用的因素才能实现。即便是基因选择论的重要倡导者 Williams 和 Dawkins 也承认并描述了这种层次因果关系（尽管他们在关于平行层次和以复制与交互为标准的不同选择中，提供了越来越复杂和难以置信的口头辩解）。因此，虽然 Williams 和 Dawkins 似乎隐约理解了层次选择的合理性，但他们仍在明确捍卫日益站不住脚的基因选择唯一性理论。

3 The logic of hierarchical selection cannot be gainsaid, and even Fisher admitted the consistency, even the theoretical necessity, while denying the empirical potency, of species selection. Fisher based his interesting and powerful argument on his assumption that low N for species in clades (relative to or­ganisms in populations) must debar any efficacy for species selection in a world of continuous and gradualistic anagenesis rooted in organismal selec­tion. However, Fisher's argument, although logically tight, fails empirically because species tend to be stable and directionally unchanging (however fluctuating) during their geological lifetimes, and the theoretically "weaker" force of species selection may therefore operate as the "only game in town" for macroevolution. The arguments for potency of species selection are stron­ger than corresponding assertions for interdemic selection (largely because species actively maintain their boundaries as Darwinian individuals, whereas demes remain subject to breakup and invasion). But, despite these intrinsic weaknesses and problems, interdemic selection has now been empirically val­idated as an important force in evolution — thus strengthening a prima facie case for the even greater importance of species selection in macroevolution.

层级选择的逻辑无法被否定，甚至 Fisher 也承认物种选择在理论上的一致性和必要性，尽管他否认了其在经验上的有效性。Fisher 的论点颇具趣味且富有力量，基于他的假设：在一个以生物选择为基础的连续和渐进的种系演化中，类群中物种的数量（相对于种群中的个体）过低，限制了物种选择的效力。然而，尽管 Fisher 的论点在逻辑上严谨，但在经验上却不成立，因为物种在其地质存在期间往往保持稳定且方向不变（即使有波动）。因此，理论上「较弱」的物种选择力可能成为宏观进化中唯一的选择。

物种选择的作用力比群体间选择更强（主要因为物种能够积极保持其作为达尔文个体的界限，而群体更容易分裂和受到入侵）。尽管存在这些内在的弱点和问题，群体间选择现在已被经验验证为进化中的一个重要力量 —— 这进一步加强了物种选择在宏观进化中更为重要的初步证据。

4 Two theoretical resolutions and clarifications have established both a sound theoretical basis, and a strong argument for the empirical potency, of species selection as an important component of macroevolution: first, the rec­ognition of differential proliferation rather than downward effect as the most operational criterion for defining and recognizing species selection; second, the acknowledgment that emergent fitnesses under the interactor approach, rather than emergent features treated as active adaptations of the species, constitute the proper criterion for identifying species selection. The former in­sistence upon emergent features (by me and other researchers, and in error), while logically sound and properly identifying a small subset of best and most interesting cases, relegated the subject to infrequent operational utility, and thus to relative impotence. The proper criterion (under the interactor ap­proach) of emergent fitness universalizes the subject by permitting general identification in the immediacy of the current mechanics of selection, and not requiring knowledge — often unavailable given the limits of historical ar­chives — of adaptive construction and utility in ancestral states.

两项理论上的解决方案和澄清为物种选择作为宏观进化的重要部分提供了坚实的理论基础和有力的实证支持。首先，研究表明，物种选择的关键在于物种的差异性扩增，而不是其向下的影响力。其次，采用交互者方法时，物种的「涌现适应性」而非涌现特征作为主动适应的标准，是识别物种选择的正确标准。此前对涌现特征的强调（包括我和其他研究人员的坚持，尽管这种强调是错误的），虽然逻辑上合理，也确实识别了一些最佳和有趣的案例，但使得该主题的实际应用不够频繁，因此效力相对有限。采用涌现适应性的标准（在交互者方法下）使这一主题普遍化，因为它允许在当前选择机制中进行广泛识别，而不需要了解祖先状态下的适应性构建和效用（这些信息由于历史档案的限制常常无法获得）。

5 The six levels recognized for convenience, and not accompanied by any claim of completion or exclusivity — gene, cell lineage, organism, deme, spe­cies and clade — feature two important principles that make the theory of hi­erarchical selection so different from, while still in the lineage and tradition of, exclusivistic Darwinian organismal selection. First, adjacent levels may in­teract in the full range of conceivable ways — in synergy, orthogonally, or in opposition. Opposition has been stressed in the existing literature, but only because this mode is easier to recognize, and not for any argument of greater importance in principle. Second, the levels operate non-fractally, with fas­cinating and distinguishing differences in mode of functioning, and relative importance of components, for each level. For example, the different mecha­nisms by which organisms and species maintain their equally strong individu­ality dictate that selection should dominate at the organismal level, while selection, drift, and drive should all play important and balanced roles at the species level.

为了方便研究，科学家们识别出了六个层次：基因、细胞谱系、有机体、群体、物种和进化支系。这些层次包含了两个重要原则，使分层选择理论虽然与传统的达尔文有机体选择不同，但仍在其传统之中。首先，相邻层次之间可以通过多种方式相互作用，包括协同、独立或对立。现有文献中对立的情况常被强调，仅仅是因为这种情况更容易被识别，而非其重要性更高。其次，这些层次以独特的方式运作，每个层次在功能和组成成分的重要性上都有不同。例如，有机体和物种通过不同的机制保持其个体性，这意味着在有机体层次上选择占主导地位，而在物种层次上，选择、漂变和驱动都起着重要而平衡的作用。

6 To cite just one difference (from conventions of the organismal level) for each nonstandard level, and to make the key point about distinctiveness of levels in an almost anecdotal manner: random change may be most promi­nent in relative frequency at the level of the gene-individual; true gene selec­tion also plays an important, if limited, role (largely in the mode that has been given the unfortunate name — for its implication of opposition, almost in ethical terms, to the supposed standard of proper organismal selection — of "selfish DNA"); however, the Dawkinsian argument for exclusivity of genic selection only records the confusion of a preferred level of bookkeeping with an erroneous claim for a privileged locus of selection. Selection among cell-lineages, although ancestrally important in the evolution of multicellular organisms, has largely been suppressed by the organismal level in the interests of its own integrity; failure of this suppression leads to the pyrrhic victory of cell-lineages that we call cancer. Interdemic selection, although once so widely rejected, probably plays an essential role in the evolution of social coopera­tion in general, and not only for such specific phenomena as human altruism. Species-level selection, combined with other species-level properties of drive and drift, establishes the independent basis for a distinctive speciational the­ory and reformulation of macroevolution. The highest level of clade selec­tion, although sometimes operative, may be relatively weak by an extension of Fisher's argument about low N.

为了揭示每个非标准层次与生物体层次的区别，并以一种生动的方式强调层次的独特性：在基因 - 个体这个层次上，随机变化可能最为显著；真正的基因选择也有重要但有限的作用（这种模式通常被称为「自私 DNA」，这一称呼不幸地暗示了它在伦理上似乎与所谓的标准生物体选择相对立）；然而，道金斯提出的关于基因选择独占性的观点实际上是将偏好的记账方式与错误宣称的选择特权位置混淆了。尽管在多细胞生物的进化历史中，细胞谱系之间的选择曾经非常重要，但为了生物体的整体性，这种选择在很大程度上被抑制了；这种抑制如果失败，就会导致我们所称的癌症这种细胞谱系的非良性胜利。尽管群体间选择曾经被广泛否定，但它可能在社会合作的进化中起到了关键作用，这不仅限于人类的利他主义等特定现象。物种层次的选择，与物种层次的驱动和漂移特性相结合，形成了一个独立的基础，用于发展独特的物种化理论和重新定义宏观进化。尽管有时会起作用，最高层次的谱系选择可能由于费舍尔关于低数量的论点而显得相对较弱。

7 I explore the distinctive differences between levels of selection by trying to exemplify and "play out" the detailed disparities in a "grand analogy" be­tween the conventional operation of organismic selection and the relative conceptual novelty of species selection. As an idiosyncratic sample of poten­tial reforms and surprises, consider the following claims: First, the formula­tion of a general taxonomy for sources of change in hierarchically ordered systems, based on a primary distinction of "drive" for directed changes aris­ing within an individual, based on change among lower-level individuals as constituent parts; and "sorting," with two causally distinct subcategories of "selection" and "drift" for change based on alterations of relative frequencies among individuals at the focal level itself. Second, the recognition, by follow­ing the logic of the analogy, of some strikingly counterintuitive comparisons that become both interesting and revealing upon subsequent reflection — in­cluding the likeness of Lamarckian change, construed as ontogenetic drive at the organismal level, with standard anagenetic transformation as organismal drive at the species level (transformation by directional change of constituent parts of a higher-level individual, in this case the organisms of a species); this similarity may also highlight the rather different reasons for general unimpor­tance of both levels of drive — Lamarckism for the well-known reason of the­oretical non-occurrence in a Mendelian world, and anagenesis based on the controversial claim for its evident plausibility in theory (as a basic Darwinian process), but rarity in fact, given the dominant relative frequency of punctu­ated equilibrium. Third, the establishment of a framework for distinguishing directional speciation as a form of reproductive drive (inherently biased dif­ferences in autapomorphies of descendant species vs. ancestral states) from true species selection as a higher order sorting among daughter species that arise with phenotypic differences randomly distributed about parental means. I believe that we have missed this crucial distinction because the ana­log of directional speciation at the organismal level — drives induced by muta­tion pressure — occur so rarely (for conventional reasons of organismal selec­tion's power to suppress them) that we haven't considered the greater potency of analogous processes at other levels. Fourth, the importance of testing "Wright's Rule" — the claim that speciation is random with respect to the di­rection of evolutionary trends within clades — because the major alternative of directional speciation as the cause of trends holds such potential power at the species level, whereas its analog (drives of mutation pressure) assumes so little importance at the organismal level. Fifth, the potentially far greater importance of drift (both species drift and founder drift) vs. selection as a mech­anism of sorting at the species level, but not at the organismal level, where se­lection predominates in standard formulations. Sixth, the identification of an intrinsically, and probably unbreakable (in most cases), negative correlation between speciation and extinction propensities as the primary constraint op­erating to prevent the takeover of life by a few megaclades (which might dom­inate by enhancing speciation while retarding extinction among constituent species — or perhaps the Coleoptera have prevailed by this means). Seventh, the recognition that the organismal level operates uniquely in securing the in­tegrity of its individuals by devices (physiological homeostasis among organs, and spatial bounding by an external surface) that "clear out" both drive from below and drift at its own level as mechanisms operating at high relative fre­quency — thus leaving selection in its most dominant position at this level. Perhaps our Darwinian prejudice for regarding selection as by far the most effective, or virtually the only important, process of evolutionary change arises more from the parochialism of our organismal focus (given our own personal residence in this category) than from any universal characterization of all levels in evolution.

我通过一个「宏大类比」来探讨选择层次之间的显著差异，比较传统的有机体选择与物种选择的新颖性。以下是一些可能的观点：首先，我们可以根据「驱动」和「排序」来制定一个分类法。「驱动」指的是在个体内部产生的变化，而「排序」包括「选择」和「漂变」两个子类别，分别表示在同一层次个体间频率变化的原因。其次，通过类比，我们可以发现一些有趣的反直觉比较，比如拉马克式变化（在个体层次）和标准的种系变化（在物种层次）的相似性。尽管两者在理论上具有合理性，但在实际中并不常见，原因包括拉马克主义在孟德尔遗传中不出现，以及种系变化受限于间断平衡理论。第三，区分定向物种形成（后代物种的特征偏向）与真正的物种选择（子物种间随机分布的排序）是关键。这种区别在有机体层次上不明显，因为突变压力驱动的变化很少见。第四，测试「赖特法则」很重要，即物种形成与进化趋势没有固定方向关系，因为定向物种形成在物种层次上可能具有强大影响，而在有机体层次并不显著。第五，在物种层次上，漂变可能比选择更为重要，而在有机体层次上，选择则占主导地位。第六，物种形成和灭绝倾向之间的负相关关系可能无法打破，这是防止生命被少数大型类群接管的主要因素。第七，有机体层次通过生理稳态和空间边界确保个体的完整性，从而抑制来自下层的驱动和自身层次的漂变，这使选择成为主要机制。这种偏见可能源于我们对有机体层次的关注，而不是对所有进化层次的普遍性认识。

Chapter 9: Punctuated equilibrium and the validation of macroevolutionary theory

1 The clear predominance of an empirical pattern of stasis and abrupt geological appearance as the history of most fossil species has always been acknowledged by paleontologists, and remains the standard testimony (as documented herein) of the best specialists in nearly every taxonomic group. In Darwinian traditions, this pattern has been attributed to imperfections of the geological record that impose this false signal upon the norm of a truly gradualistic history. Darwin's argument may work in principle for punctuational origin, but stasis is data and cannot be so encompassed.

第 9 章：间断平衡与宏观进化论的验证

1 古生物学家一直承认，大多数化石物种的历史主要表现为长时间的静止状态和突然的地质出现，这仍然是几乎所有分类群中顶尖专家公认的标准现象（如本文记录所示）。在达尔文的传统理论中，这种模式通常被解释为地质记录的不完整导致的误导信号，而非真正的渐进历史。达尔文的解释可能适用于间断性起源，但对于静止状态而言，它作为数据本身是无法被这样解释的。

2 This traditional argument from imperfection has stymied the study of evolution by paleontologists because the record's primary (and operational) signal has been dismissed as misleading, or as "no data." Punctuated equilib­rium, while not denying imperfection, regards this signal as a basically accu­rate record of evolution's standard mode at the level of the origin of species. In particular, before the formulation of punctuated equilibrium, stasis had been read as an embarrassing indication of absence of evidence for the de­sired subject of study — that is, of data for evolution itself, falsely defined as gradual change — and this eminently testable, fully operational, and intellec­tually fascinating (and positive) subject of stasis had never been subjected to quantitative empirical study, a situation that has changed dramatically during the last 25 years.

这个传统的不完美论点曾经阻碍了古生物学家对进化的研究，因为记录的主要信号常被误解为无用或不存在的数据。然而，间断平衡理论虽然承认不完美，但认为这一信号实际上准确地反映了物种起源层面上的进化模式。特别是在间断平衡理论出现之前，停滞常被认为是缺乏进化证据的尴尬表现，因为进化错误地被定义为渐进变化。这个停滞问题本身极具可测试性和智力上的吸引力，但过去却从未进行过定量的实证研究。在过去的 25 年中，这种状况发生了显著的变化，人们开始对停滞进行深入的研究。

3 The key empirical ingredients of punctuated equilibrium — punctuation, stasis, and their relative frequencies — can be made testable and defined operationally. The theory only refers to the origin and development of species in geological time, and must not be misconstrued (as so often done) as a claim for true saltation at a lower organismal level, or for catastrophic mass extinction at a higher faunal level. Punctuation must be scaled relative to the later duration of species in stasis, and we suggest 1-2 percent (analogous to human gestation vs. the length of human life) as an upper bound. Punctuated equi­librium can be distinguished from other causes of rapid change (including anagenetic passage through bottlenecks and the traditional claim of imperfect preservation for a truly gradualistic event) by the criterion of ancestral sur­vival following the branching of a descendant. Punctuations can be revealed by positive evidence (rather than inferred from compression on a single bed­ding plane) in admittedly rare situations, but not so infrequent in absolute number, of unusual fineness of stratigraphic resolution or ability to date the individual specimens of a single bedding plane. Stasis is not defined as abso­lute phenotypic immobility, but as fluctuation of means through time at a magnitude not statistically broader than the range of geographic variation among modern populations of similar species, and not directional in any pre­ferred way, especially not towards the phenotype of descendants. Punctuated equilibrium will be validated, as all such theories in natural history must be (including natural selection itself), by predominant relative frequency, not by exclusivity. Gradualism certainly can and does occur, but at very low relative frequencies when all species of a fauna are tabulated, and when we overcome our conventional bias for studying only the small percentage of species quali­tatively recognized beforehand as having changed through time.

断点平衡学说中的核心实证要素 —— 断点、停滞及其相对频率 —— 是可以测试和操作性定义的。该理论仅适用于解释地质时间尺度上物种的起源和发展，不能被误解为是在较低生物层面上发生真正的跃变或在更高动物群层面上造成灾难性灭绝的理论。断点应当根据物种在停滞阶段的后续持续时间进行衡量。我们建议将 1-2% 作为上限，这类似于人类妊娠期与人类寿命的比例。通过后代分支后祖先仍然存活的标准，可以将断点平衡与其他快速变化的原因区分开来，例如通过瓶颈效应的谱系变化和对真正渐变事件保存不完善的传统看法。断点可以在少数情况下通过明确的证据揭示出来，而不仅仅是从单一沉积层的压缩推断出来，这些情况虽然不多，但在绝对数量上并不罕见，尤其是在地层分辨率非常高或能够对单一沉积层的个体标本进行年代测定的情况下。停滞并不意味着绝对的表型不变，而是指随着时间的推移，其平均值的波动幅度不超过现代相似物种种群之间的地理变异范围，并且没有明显的方向性，特别是没有朝向后代表型的趋势。断点平衡将通过其主要相对频率得到验证，就像自然历史中的所有此类理论一样（包括自然选择），而不是通过排他性来验证。渐进变化虽然确实会发生，但在所有动物群的物种中，它的相对频率非常低。我们需要克服传统的研究偏见，关注那些仅占少数且被事先识别为发生过时间变化的物种。

4 Punctuated equilibrium emerges as the expected scaling of ordinary allopatric speciation into geological time, and does not suggest or imply radi­cally different evolutionary mechanisms at the level of the origin of species. (Other proposed mechanisms of speciation, including most sympatric modes, envision rates of speciation even faster than conventional allopatry, and are therefore even more consistent with punctuated equilibrium.) The theoreti­cally radical features of punctuated equilibrium flow from its proposals for macroevolution, with species treated as higher-level Darwinian individuals analogous to organisms in microevolution.

断续平衡被视为普通异域物种形成在地质时间中的自然进程，并不暗示物种起源过程中存在根本不同的进化机制。（其他物种形成机制的提出，包括大多数同域模式，设想其物种形成的速度甚至比传统异域模式更快，因此更符合断续平衡的理论。）断续平衡的理论激进性来自于其对宏观进化的观点，将物种视为类似于微观进化中有机体的更高层次的达尔文个体。

5 The difficulty of defining species in the fossil record does not threaten the validity of punctuated equilibrium for several reasons. First, in the few studies with adequate data for genetic and experimental resolution, paleo­species (even for such difficult and morphologically labile species as colonial cheilostome bryozoans) have been documented as excellent surrogates, com­parable as units to conventional biospecies. Second, the potential underesti­mation of biospecies by paleospecies only imposes a bias that makes punctu­ated equilibrium harder to recognize. The fossil record's strongly positive signal for punctuated equilibrium, in the light of this bias, only increases the probability of the pattern's importance and high relative frequency. Third, the potential overestimation of biospecies by paleospecies is probably false in any case, and also of little practical concern because no paleontologist would as­sert punctuated equilibrium from the evidence of oversplit taxa in faunal lists, but only from direct biometric study of stasis and punctuation in actual data.

在化石记录中定义物种的困难，并不会威胁到间断平衡理论的有效性，原因有几个。首先，在少数具有足够遗传和实验数据的研究中，即使是像群体性苔藓虫这样难以界定且形态多变的物种，古生物种也被证明是很好的替代品，可以与传统生物物种相媲美。其次，古生物种可能低估生物物种，这种偏差只会让间断平衡更难被发现。然而，即便如此，化石记录中依然存在强烈的间断平衡信号，这反而增加了这种模式的重要性和出现的频率。最后，古生物种可能高估生物物种的说法基本上是错误的，并且在实际应用中并不重要，因为古生物学家不会仅凭过度细分的动物群列表来判断间断平衡，而是通过研究实际数据中的静止和突变来做出结论。

6 We originally, and probably wrongly, tried to validate punctuated equilibrium by asserting that, in principle, most evolutionary change should be concentrated at events of speciation themselves. Subsequent work in evolu­tionary biology has not confirmed any a priori preference for concentration in such episodes. Futuyama's incisive macroevolutionary argument — that re­alized change will not become geologically stabilized and conserved unless such change can be "tied up" in the unalienable individuality of a new spe­cies — offers a far richer, far more interesting, and theoretically justified ra­tionale for correlating episodes of evolutionary change with speciation.

我们最初可能错误地认为，通过断言大多数进化变化应该集中发生在物种形成过程中，可以验证间断平衡理论。然而，进化生物学的后续研究并未支持这一观点。Futuyama 提出的一个重要的宏观进化论观点是：进化变化只有在被新物种独特的个体性「固定」时，才可能在地质历史上稳定和保存下来。这一观点为将进化变化与物种形成事件联系起来，提供了一个更丰富、有趣且理论上合理的解释。

7 Section III presents a wide-ranging discussion of why proposed empirical refutations of punctuated equilibrium either do not hold in fact, or do not bear the logical weight claimed in their presentation. Refutations for single cases are often valid, but do not challenge the general hypothesis because we anticipate a low relative frequency for gradualism, and these cases may reside in this minor category. Claims for predominant gradualism in the entire clade of planktonic forams may hold as exceptional (although, even here, the ma­jority of lineages remain unstudied, in large part because they seem, at least subjectively, to remain in stasis, and have therefore not attracted the attention of traditional researchers, who wish to study evolution, but then equate evo­lution with gradualism). However, in these asexual forms with vast popula­tions, gradualism at this level may just represent the expected higher-level expression of punctuational clone selection, as Lenski has affirmed in the most thorough study of evolution in a modern bacterial species — and just as gradual cladal trends in multicellular lineages emerge as the expected conse­quences of sequential punctuated equilibrium at the species level (trends as stairsteps rather than inclined planes, so to speak). Claims for genetic gradu­alism do not challenge punctuated equilibrium, and may well be anticipated as the proper expression at the genic level (especially given the high relative frequency of random nucleotide substitutions) of morphological stasis in the phenotypic history of species. Punctuated equilibrium has done well in tests of conformity with general models, particularly in the conclusion that exten­sive polytomy in cladistic models may arise not only (as usually interpreted) from insufficient data to resolve a sequence of close dichotomies, but also as the expectation of punctuated equilibrium for successive branching of daugh­ter species from an unchanged parental form in stasis. In fact, the frequency of polytomy vs. dichotomy may be used as a test for the relative frequency of punctuated equilibrium in well resolved cladograms — a test well passed in data presented by Wagner and Erwin.

第七节中，我们深入探讨了为什么针对间断平衡理论（punctuated equilibrium）的经验性反驳要么并不成立，要么没有达到其声称的逻辑严谨性。在单个案例中，这些反驳通常是有效的，但并不动摇整体假设，因为我们预期渐变（gradualism）的出现频率较低，这些案例可能仅属于少数现象。尽管有人声称整个浮游有孔虫类群中以渐变为主，但这可能只是个别情况（尽管这里的大多数谱系尚未研究，主要因为它们看似保持不变，因此没有吸引关注研究进化的传统学者的兴趣，而这些学者往往将进化等同于渐变）。然而，对于这些庞大种群的无性繁殖形式，这种渐变可能只是间断克隆选择的高级表现，正如 Lenski 在对现代细菌物种的深入研究中所证实的那样 —— 就像多细胞谱系中的渐变趋势是物种水平上间断平衡逐步实现的结果（可以形象地理解为阶梯而非斜坡）。主张遗传渐变并不挑战间断平衡，并且很可能是种系表型历史中形态稳定的基因层面的合理表现（特别是考虑到随机核苷酸替换频率较高）。间断平衡在与通用模型的一致性测试中表现良好，尤其是在系统发生模型中，广泛的多分支现象不仅（如通常所认为的）因数据不足以解决一系列紧密二分支关系而起，也可能是由于间断平衡在未变的母体形态中连续分支的预期结果。事实上，多分支与二分支的频率可以作为检测在细致的系统发生树中间断平衡相对频率的指标 —— 而 Wagner 和 Erwin 的数据也支持了这一测试方法。

8 Section IV then summarizes the data on empirical affirmations of punctuated equilibrium, first on documented patterns of stasis in unbranched lineages; second on punctuational cladogenesis affirmed by the criterion of ancestral survival; third on predominant relative frequencies for punctuated equilibrium in entire biotas (with particularly impressive affirmations by Hallam, Kelley, and Stanley and Yang for mollusks; and by Prothero and Heaton for Oligocene Big Badlands mammals, where a study of all taxa yielded 177 species that followed the expectations of punctuated equilibrium and three cases of potential gradualism, only one significant); fourth on predominant relative frequencies for punctuated equilibrium in entire clades, with emphasis on Vrba's antelopes and, especially, Cheetham's rigorously quantitative and multivariate data of evolution in the bryozoan genus Metrarabdotos, perhaps the best documented and most impressive case of exclusive punctu­ated equilibrium ever developed. Finally, we can learn much from variation in relative frequencies among taxa, times, and environments — and interesting inferences have been drawn from recorded differences, particularly in Shel­don's counterintuitive linkage of stasis to rapidly changing, and gradualism to stable, environments.

第八节总结了关于断续平衡的实证数据。首先，记录了未分支谱系的停滞模式；其次，通过祖先生存的标准确认了断续式谱系分化；第三，分析了整个生物群中断续平衡的主要相对频率，特别是 Hallam、Kelley 和 Stanley 及 Yang 对软体动物的研究结果尤为引人注目。此外，Prothero 和 Heaton 针对渐新世大坏地哺乳动物的研究，发现所有分类群中有 177 个物种符合断续平衡的预期，仅发现三个潜在的渐变案例，其中只有一个是显著的。第四，探讨了整个类群中断续平衡的相对频率，重点研究了 Vrba 的羚羊，特别是 Cheetham 对苔藓虫属 Metrarabdotos 进化的严格定量和多变量数据，这可能是迄今为止最为详尽的断续平衡案例。最后，我们可以从不同分类群、时间和环境中的相对频率变化中得到很多启示，尤其是 Sheldon 提出的停滞与快速变化环境的反常联系，以及渐变与稳定环境的联系，带来了有趣的推论。

9 Among many reasons proposed to explain the predominance of stasis, a phenomenon not even acknowledged as a "real" and positive aspect of evo­lution before punctuated equilibrium gave it some appropriate theoretical space, habitat tracking (favored by Eldredge), constraints imposed by the nature of subdivided populations (favored by Lieberman), and normalizing clade selection (proposed by Williams) represent the most novel and interest­ing proposals.

在解释停滞现象为何在进化中占据主导地位的众多原因中，过去这种现象甚至未被视作进化的「真实」且积极的方面，直到间断平衡理论为其提供了适当的理论空间。其中，Eldredge 支持的栖息地追踪、Lieberman 支持的由分化群体性质施加的限制以及 Williams 提出的正常化进化枝选择，是最为新颖和有趣的观点。

10 Among the implications of a predominantly punctuational origin of stable species-individuals for macroevolutionary theory, we must rethink trends (the primary phenomenon of macroevolution, at least in terms of dedi­cated discussion in existing literature) as products of the differential success of certain kinds of species, rather than as the adaptive anagenesis of lin­eages — a radical reformulation with consequences extending to a new set of explanations no longer rooted (as in all traditional resolutions) in the adap­tive advantages conferred upon organisms, but potentially vested in such structural principles as sequelae (by hitchhiking or as spandrels) of fortuitous phenotypic linkage to higher speciation rates of certain taxa. In further exten­sions, macroevolution itself must be reconfigured in speciational terms, with attendant implications for a wide range of phenomena, including Cope's rule (structurally ordained biases of speciation away from a lower size limit occu­pied by founding members of the clade, rather than adaptive anagenesis to­wards organismal benefits of large size), living fossils (members of clades with persistently minimal rates of speciation, and therefore no capacity for ever generating much change in a speciational scheme, rather than forms that are either depauperate of variation, or have occupied morphological optima for untold ages), and reinterpretation of cladal trends long misinterpreted as tri­umphs of progressive evolution (and now reevaluated in terms of variational range in species numbers, rather than vectors of mean morphology across all species at any time — leading, for example, to a recognition that modern horses represent the single surviving twig of a once luxurious, and now de­pleted, clade, and not the apex of a continually progressing trend). By the same argument, generalized to all of life, we understand the stability and con­tinued domination of bacteria as the outstanding feature of life's history, with the much vaunted progress of complexity towards mammalian elegance rein­terpreted as a limited drift of a minor component of diversity into the only open space of complexity's theoretical distribution. But, to encompass this re­formulation, we need to focus upon the diversity and variation among life's species, not upon the supposed vectors of its central tendencies, or even its peripheral superiorities. Hominid evolution must also be rethought as reduction of diversity to a single species of admittedly spectacular (but perhaps quite transient) current success. In addition, the last 50,000 years or more of hu­man phenotypic stability becomes a theoretical expectation under punctuated equilibrium, and not the anomaly so often envisaged (and attributed to the suppression of natural selection by cultural evolution) both by the lay public and by many professionals as well.

在宏观进化理论中，稳定物种的主要来源是间断性演化，这意味着我们需要重新看待宏观进化中的趋势。传统上，趋势被认为是谱系适应性变化的结果，但现在我们需要将其视为某些物种类型在差异化成功中的产物。这一重新定义可能带来一系列新的解释，不再仅仅依赖于生物体获得的适应性优势，而是可能涉及与某些类群较高物种形成率偶然相关的结构性原则（例如，搭便车效应或作为副产品的结果）。

进一步来说，宏观进化本身需要在物种化的框架中重新解读，这对许多现象都有影响。例如，科普法则不再是物种适应性进化导致的大型化趋势，而是物种化偏离创始类群的小型限制。活化石则指的是物种化速率极低的类群成员，而不是长期维持形态最优或缺乏变异的生物。我们还需要重新评估那些被误解为进步演化的类群趋势。例如，现代的马并不是一条持续进步的演化顶点，而是一个曾经繁荣现在衰退的类群的唯一存活分支。

通过类似的思考方式，我们可以理解细菌的稳定性和持续存在是生命历史中的一个重要特征，而复杂性向哺乳动物进化的所谓进步则被重新解释为有限的变化，是在复杂性理论分布中的一个小范围漂移。然而，要全面理解这种重新定义，我们需要关注生命物种之间的多样性和变异，而不是其假定的中心趋势，甚至不是其外围的优势。

人类进化也需要重新思考为一种多样性的减少，尽管目前的人类在地球上取得了显著（但可能是短暂的）成功。此外，人类在过去五万年或更长时间内的表型稳定性，在间断平衡理论下是一个预期现象，而不是通常被认为由于文化进化抑制自然选择而导致的异常。

11 Further extensions of punctuated equilibrium include the controversial phenomenon of "coordinated stasis," or the proposition that entire faunas, and not merely their component species, tend to remain surprisingly stable in composition over durations far longer than any model based on independent behavior of species (even under punctuated equilibrium) would allow, al­though other researchers attribute the same results to extended consequences of sudden external pulses and resulting faunal turnovers, while still others deny the empirics of coordination and continue to view species as more inde­pendent, one from the other, even in the classical faunas (like the Devonian Hamilton Group) that serve as "types" for coordinated stasis.

进一步扩展的间断平衡理论包括一个有争议的现象，即「协调停滞」。这一观点认为，整个动物群，而不仅仅是其个别物种，可以在很长的时间里保持惊人的稳定性。这种稳定性持续的时间长于任何基于物种独立行为（即使是间断平衡理论下）的模型所能预测的。虽然有些研究人员将这种现象解释为突然的外部冲击及其导致的动物群更替的长期结果，但也有学者质疑这一协调现象的真实性，认为物种之间仍然是相对独立的。这一观点即使在一些经典动物群（如泥盆纪的哈密尔顿群）中也有争议，它们被视为「协调停滞」的典型例子。

12 Punctuated equilibrium has inspired several attempts, of varying suc­cess in my limited judgment, to construct mathematical models (or to simu­late its central phenomena in simple computer systems of evolving "artificial life") that may help us to identify the degree of generality in modes of change that this particular biological system, at this particular level of speciation, exemplifies and records. Punctuated equilibrium has also proved its utility in extension by meaningful analogy (based on common underlying principles of change) to the generation of punctuational hypotheses at other levels, and for other kinds of phenomena, where similar gradualistic biases had prevailed and had stymied new approaches to research. These extensions range from phyletic and ecological examples below the species level to interesting ana­logs of both stasis and punctuation above the species level. Non-trending, the analog of stasis in large clades, for example, had been previously disre­garded — following the same fate as stasis in species — as a boring manifesta­tion of non-evolution, but has now been recognized and documented as a real and fascinating phenomenon in itself. Punctuational analogs have proven their utility for understanding the differential pace of morphological innova­tion within large clades, and for resolving a variety of punctuational phenom­ena in ecological systems, including such issues of the immediate moment as rates of change in benthic faunas (previously the province of hypotheses about glacially slow and steady change in constantly depauperate environ­ments), and such questions of broadest geological scale as the newly recognized stepped and punctuational "morphology" (correcting the hypothetical growth through substantial time of all previous gradualistic accounts) of mutual biomechanical improvement in competing clades involved in "arms шее," and generating a pattern known as "escalation."

间断平衡理论激发了多次尝试，这些尝试在构建数学模型或在简单计算机系统中模拟「人工生命」的演化现象方面取得了不同程度的成功。这些研究有助于我们理解特定生物系统在特定物种形成阶段的变化模式的普遍性。间断平衡还通过有意义的类比拓展了其应用范围，基于共同的变化原则，这一理论被应用于其他层次和现象中，过去这些领域常常受到渐进主义偏见的阻碍，限制了新研究方法的发展。这些扩展包括物种水平以下的进化和生态学例子，以及物种水平以上的静止和间断现象的类比。比如，大型类群中的静止现象曾被忽视，因为它与物种中静止现象一样被认为是无趣的非进化表现，但现在它被认知为一种真实且引人入胜的现象。间断现象的类比已被证明在理解大型类群中形态创新的不同速度方面具有实用性，并有助于解释生态系统中的各种间断现象。例如，底栖动物群的变化速度一度被认为是缓慢而稳定的，但现在被重新评估为更复杂的过程。此外，地质尺度上被新发现的分步和间断「形态」也修正了先前渐进主义的观点，这些研究揭示了在竞争类群中的生物机械改进中，「军备竞赛」的模式，形成一种被称为「升级」的现象。

13 Punctuational models have also been useful, even innovative in break­ing conceptual logjams, in nonbiological fields ranging from closely cognate studies of the history of human tools (including extended stasis in the Homo erectus toolkit), and nontrending, despite classical (and false) claims to the contrary by both experts, the Abbe Breuil and Andre Leroi-Gourhan, for the 25,000 year history of elegance in parietal cave art of France and Spain — and extending into more distant fields like learning theory (plateaus and innova­tive punctuations), studies of the dynamics of human organizations, patterns of human history, and the evolution of technologies, including a fascinating account of the history of books, through punctuations of the clay tablet, the scroll, the codex, and our current electronic reformation (wherever it may lead), and long periods of morphological stasis (graced with such vital inno­vations as printing, imposed upon the unaltered phenotype of the codex, or standard "book").

断裂模型在非生物学领域也展现出其重要性，甚至在突破概念瓶颈方面显得极具创新性。这些应用领域包括人类工具历史的研究，例如 Homo erectus 工具的长期停滞状态。尽管 Abbe Breuil 和 Andre Leroi-Gourhan 两位专家曾对法国和西班牙洞穴艺术的 25000 年历史提出过传统但错误的看法，这些领域并未表现出趋势变化。断裂模型的应用还扩展至更广阔的领域，比如学习理论中的平台期和创新性断裂、人类组织的动态变化、人类历史的模式以及技术的演变。这其中包括一个关于书籍历史的引人入胜的描述，从泥板、卷轴、抄本到我们现今的电子转型（无论将来如何发展），以及在形态上长期停滞（如印刷术对未改变的抄本或标准「书籍」形态的影响）。

14 In a long and final section, I indulge myself, and perhaps provide some useful primary source material for future historians of scientific conflicts, by recording the plethora of non-scientific citations, ranging from the absurd to the insightful, for punctuated equilibrium (including creationist misuses and their politically effective exposure by scientists in courtroom trials that de­feated creationist legislative initiatives; and the treatment of punctuated equi­librium, often very good but sometimes very bad, by journalists and by au­thors of textbooks — the primary arenas of vernacular passage). I also trace and repudiate the "dark side" of non-scientific reactions by professional col­leagues who emoted at challenges to their comfort, rather than reacting criti­cally and sharply (as most others did, and as discussed extensively in the main body of the chapter) to the interesting novelty, accompanied by some promi­nent errors of inevitable and initial groping on our part, spawned by the basic hypothesis and cascading implications of punctuated equilibrium.

在一个漫长且最终的部分中，我详细记录了大量从荒谬到深刻的非科学引用，或许为未来研究科学争论的历史学家提供了一些有用的原始资料。这些引用涉及间断平衡（Punctuated Equilibrium）的不同方面，包括创造论者的误用，以及科学家在法庭上如何通过揭露这些误用来有效阻止创造论的立法倡议。此外，我也探讨了记者和教科书作者对间断平衡的描述，这些描述有时非常出色，但有时却相当糟糕，这些都是普及性传播的主要途径。我还追踪并否定了一些专业同事对于非科学反应的「黑暗面」。这些同事在面对挑战他们既有观念的情况下，往往感情用事而不是进行批判性和尖锐的分析（正如大多数其他同事所做的那样，并在本章主体中进行了广泛讨论）。这些反应是由间断平衡这一基本假设及其连锁影响所引发的初步探讨错误所导致的。

Chapter 10: The integration of constraint and adaptation: historical constraint and the evolution of development

1 Although the directing of evolutionary change by forces other than natu­ral selection has loosely been described as "constraint," the term, even while acknowledged as a domain for exceptions to standard Darwinian mecha­nisms, has almost always been conceived as a "negative" force or phenome­non, a mode of preventing (through lack of variation, for example) a popula­tion's attainment of greater adaptation. But constraint, both in our science (and in vernacular English as well), also has strongly positive meanings in two quite different senses: first, or empirically, as channeled directionality for reasons of past history (conserved as homology) or physical principles; and second, or conceptually, as an nonstandard force (therefore interesting ipso facto) acting differently from what orthodoxy would predict.

1 虽然自然选择之外的力量对进化变化的引导通常被称为「约束」，但这个词即使被视为达尔文标准机制的一个例外，几乎总是被视为一种「消极」的力量或现象，即通过缺乏变异来阻止一个群体获得更好适应性的方式。然而，在科学界（以及日常英语中），约束在两个截然不同的意义上也有积极的含义：首先，从经验上看，它可以是由于历史因素（保留为同源性）或物理原则而形成的引导性方向性；其次，从概念上看，它作为一种非标准的力量，作用方式与传统预测不同，因此本身就很有趣。

2 The classical and most familiar category of internal channeling (the first, or empirical, citation of constraint as a positive theme) resides in preferred di­rections for evolutionary change supplied by inherited allometries and their phylogenetic potentiation by heterochrony. As "place holders" for an exten­sive literature, I present two examples from my own work: first, the illustra­tion of synergy with natural selection (to exemplify the positive, rather than oppositional, meaning), where an inherited internal channel builds two important adaptations by means of one heterochronic alteration, as neoteny in descendant Gryphaea species of the English Jurassic produces shells of both markedly increased size (by retention of juvenile growth rates over an un­changed lifetime) and stabilized shape to prevent foundering in muddy envi­ronments (achieved by "bringing forward" the proportions of attached juve­niles into the unattached stage of adult ontogeny); second, an illustration of pervasiveness and equal (or greater) power than selective forces (to exemplify the strength and high relative frequency of such positive influences), as geo­graphic variation of the type species, Cerion uva, on Aruba, Bonaire, and Curasao, a subject of intense quantitative study and disagreement in the past, becomes resolved in multivariate terms, with clear distinction between local adaptive differences and the pervasive general pattern of an extensive suite of automatic sequelae, generated by nonadaptive variation in the geometry of coiling a continuous tube, under definite allometric regularities for the genus, around an axis.

内部引导的经典类别（首次或经验性地将约束视为积极主题的引用）存在于进化过程中，由遗传异速生长（allometries）及其通过异时性（heterochrony）产生的系统发育潜力所提供的优选方向中。作为广泛文献的参考，我提供了两个来自我自身研究的例子：首先，与自然选择协同作用的例子（以展示其积极意义，而非对立），在这个例子中，一种遗传的内部引导通过异时性的变化，产生了两个重要的适应性特征。以英格兰侏罗纪的 Gryphaea 后代物种为例，其通过保留幼体的生长速率，在整个生命周期内增大了壳体，并稳定了形状，以防止在泥泞环境中倾覆（通过将附着幼体的比例提前应用于成年个体发育的非附着阶段）。其次，展示了这种影响的普遍性及其不亚于甚至超过选择力的力量（以展示这种积极影响的强度和相对频率）。例如，类型物种 Cerion uva 在阿鲁巴、博内尔和库拉索的地理变异，这一主题曾是过去激烈的定量研究和争论的焦点，如今在多变量分析中得到了解决，明确区分了局部适应性差异和普遍的自动模式，这些模式是在属级异速生长规律下，由非适应性变化形成的。

3 For the second, or conceptually positive, meaning of constraint as a term for nonstandard causes of evolutionary change, I present a model that com­pares the conventional outcomes of direct natural selection, leading to local adaptation, with two sources that can also yield adaptive results, but for rea­sons of channeling by internal constraints rather than by direct construc­tion under external forces of natural selection. In this triangular model for aptive structures, the functional vertex represents features conventionally built by natural selection for current utilities. At the historical vertex, cur­rently aptive features probably originated for conventionally adaptive rea­sons in distant ancestors; but these features are now developmentally chan­neled as homologies that constrain and positively direct both patterns of immediate change and the inhomogeneous occupation of morphospace (espe­cially as indicated by "deep homologies" of retained developmental patterns among phyla that diverged from common ancestry more than 500 million years ago). At the structural vertex, two very different reasons underlie the origin of potentially aptive features for initially nonadaptive reasons: physical principles that build "good" form by the direct action of physical laws upon plastic material (as in D'Arcy Thompson's theory of form), and architectural sequelae (spandrels) that arise as nonadaptive consequences of other features, and then become available for later cooptation (as exaptations) to aptive ends in descendant taxa. These two structural reasons differ strongly in the ahis-toricist implications of direct physical production independent of phyletic context vs. the explicit historical analysis needed to identify the particular foundation for the origin of spandrels in any individual lineage.

对于「限制」这个术语在进化变化的非标准原因中的第二种或积极意义，我提出了一个模型来比较直接自然选择（导致局部适应）的常规结果，与由内部限制引导而非外部自然选择力量直接作用的两种适应性结果来源。在这个适应性结构的三角模型中，功能顶点代表了常规上由自然选择为当前用途构建的特征。在历史顶点，目前的适应特征可能源于遥远祖先的常规适应性原因；但这些特征现在作为同源性在发育上被引导，限制并积极引导直接变化的模式和形态空间的不均匀分布（特别是通过门类间超过 5 亿年前从共同祖先分化的「深同源性」所指示）。在结构顶点，潜在适应特征可以因两种截然不同的非适应性原因而起：一种是物理原理通过物理定律直接作用于可塑材料而形成「良好」形式（如 D'Arcy Thompson 的形式理论），另一种是作为其他特征的非适应性后果出现的建筑后遗症（拱顶），然后在后代分类中被重新利用（作为外适应）。这两种结构原因在直接物理生成独立于系统发育背景的非历史主义含义与识别个体谱系中拱顶起源的具体基础所需的历史分析之间，存在显著差异。

4 As a conceptual basis for understanding the importance of recent ad­vances in evo-devo (the study of the evolution of development), the largely unknown history of debate about categories of homology, particularly the distinction between convergence and parallelism, provides our best ordering device — for we then learn to recognize the key contrast between parallelism as a positive deep constraint of homology in underlying generators (and therefore as a structuralist theme in evolution) and convergence as the opposite sign of domination for external natural selection upon a yielding internal substrate that imposes no constraint (and therefore as a functionalist theme in evolution). As a beginning paradox, we must grasp why E. Ray Lankester coined the term homoplasy as a category of homology, whereas today's termi­nology ranks the concepts as polar opposites. Lankester wanted to contrast homology of overt structure (homogeny in his terms, or homology sensu stricto) with homology of underlying generators (later called parallelism) building the same structure in two separate lineages (homoplasy, or homol­ogy sensu lato, in Lankester's terms). Because parallelism could not be cashed out in operational terms (as science had no way, until our current revolution in evo-devo, to characterize, or even to recognize, these underlying genera­tors), proper conceptual distinctions between parallelism and convergence have generally not been made, and the two terms have even (and often) been united as subtypes of homoplasy (now defined in the current, and utterly non-Lankesterian sense, as opposite to homology). I trace the complex and con­fused history of this discussion, and show that structuralist thinkers, with doubts about panadaptationism, have always been most sensitive to this is­sue, and most insistent upon separating and distinguishing parallelism as the chief category of positive developmental constraint — a category that has now, for the first time, become scientifically operational.

为了理解进化发育生物学（evo-devo，即研究发育的进化）最近进展的重要性，我们可以从历史上关于同源性类别的辩论中找到线索，特别是关于趋同和平行区别的讨论。这让我们能够识别出一种关键的对比，即平行作为同源性内在生成器的深层约束（因此在进化中表现为结构主义的主题），而趋同则是外部自然选择对无约束的内在基质的影响（因此在进化中表现为功能主义的主题）。一个有趣的悖论是，E. Ray Lankester 曾经将同质性视作同源性的一种，而现在这些术语却被认为是对立的。Lankester 试图对比显性结构的同源性（他称为均质性，或严格意义上的同源性）与在两个独立谱系中由内在生成器构建相同结构的同源性（后来称为平行，或广义上的同源性）。由于在科学上，直到最近的 evo-devo 革命，我们才有能力识别和描述这些内在生成器，因此过去很难在概念上清晰地区分平行和趋同，甚至常将它们合并为同质性的子类型（如今被定义为同源性的对立面）。我追溯了这一复杂且混乱的讨论历史，并指出，那些对泛适应主义持怀疑态度的结构主义思想家一直对这一问题最为敏感，并始终坚持将平行视为积极发育约束的主要类别进行区分 —— 而这一类别现在终于在科学上变得可操作了。

5 I summarize the revolutionary empirics and conceptualizations of evo-devo in four themes, united by a common goal: to rebalance constraint and adaptation as causes and forces of evolution, and to acknowledge the perva­siveness and importance — also the synergy with natural selection, rather than opposition to Darwinian themes — of developmental constraint as a positive, structuralist, and internal force. The first theme explores the implications — for internally directed evolutionary pathways and consequent clumping of taxa in morphospace — of the remarkable and utterly unanticipated discovery of extensive "deep homology" among phyla separated at least since the Cam­brian explosion, as expressed by shared and highly conserved genes regulat­ing fundamental processes of development. I first discuss the role and ac­tion of some of these developmental systems — the ABC genes of Arabidopsis in regulating circlets of structures in floral morphology, the Hox genes of Drosophila in regulating differentiation of organs along the AP axis, and the role of the Pax-6 system in the development of eyes — in validating (only par­tially, of course) the archetypal theories of 19th century transcendental mor­phology, long regarded as contrary to strictly selectionist views of life's his­tory — particularly Goethe's theory of the leaf archetype, and Geoffroy's idea of the vertebral groundplan of AP differentiation. I then discuss the even more exciting subject of homologically conserved systems across distant phyla, as expressed in high sequence similarity of important regulators, com­mon rules of development (particularly the "Hoxology" followed in both ar­thropod and vertebrate ontogeny), and similar action of homeotic mutations that impact Hoxological rules by loss or gain of function. Geoffroy was partially right in asserting segmental homology between arthropods and ver­tebrates, particularly for the comparison of insect metameres with rhombomeric segments in the developing vertebrate brain (a small part, perhaps, of the AP axis of most modern vertebrates, but the major component of the earliest fossil vertebrates), where the segments themselves may form differ­ently, but where rules of Hoxology then work in the same manner during later differentiation. I also defend the substantial validity of Geoffroy's other "crazy" comparison — the dorsoventral inversion of the same basic body plan between arthropods and vertebrates.

我总结了进化发育生物学（evo-devo）中的革命性经验和概念，聚焦在四个主题上。这些主题的共同目标是重新平衡约束和适应作为进化的原因和动力，并认可发育约束作为一种积极的、结构性的内部力量的广泛性和重要性。这种力量与自然选择协同，而不是对抗达尔文的理论。第一个主题探讨了在形态空间中类群的内部定向进化路径及其聚集的含义。这种现象是由于在寒武纪大爆发以来分离的门之间发现了广泛的「深层同源性」，这些同源性由调节基本发育过程的共享且高度保守的基因表达出来。我首先讨论了一些发育系统中基因的作用，例如，阿拉伯芥的 ABC 基因在调节花部结构中的作用，果蝇的 Hox 基因在调节器官分化中的作用，以及 Pax-6 系统在眼睛发育中的作用。这些基因在一定程度上验证了 19 世纪的超验形态学理论，这些理论长期以来被认为与严格的选择主义观点相悖，尤其是歌德的叶子原型理论和 Geoffroy 的脊椎动物 AP 分化理论。接着，我讨论了跨越不同门类的同源保守系统，这些系统显示出重要调节因子之间的高度序列相似性、共同的发育规则（特别是在节肢动物和脊椎动物发育中遵循的「Hoxology」），以及同源突变在功能丧失或获得上的相似作用。Geoffroy 部分正确地指出了节肢动物和脊椎动物之间的节段同源性，尤其是在昆虫体节与发育中的脊椎动物大脑中的脑节段的比较中。虽然这些节段可能以不同方式形成，但在后期分化过程中，Hoxology 的规则仍以相同方式发挥作用。我还支持 Geoffroy 的另一个「大胆」比较的合理性，即节肢动物和脊椎动物之间基本身体结构的背腹反转。

6 The second theme stresses the even more positive role of parallelism, based on common action of regulators shared by deep homology, in directing the evolutionary pathways of distantly related phyla into similar channels of adaptations thus more easily generated (thereby defining this phenomenon as synergistic and consistent with an expanded Darwinian theory, and not confrontational or dismissive of selection). I discuss such broad scale examples as the stunning discovery of substantial parallelism in the supposedly classical, "poster boy" expression of the opposite phenomenon of convergence — the development of eyes in arthropods, vertebrates, and cephalopods. The overt adult phenotype, of course, remains largely convergent, but homology of the underlying regulators demonstrates the strong internal channeling of parallel­ism. The vertebrate and squid version of Pax-6 can, in fact, both rescue the development of eyes in Drosophila and produce ectopic expression of eyes in such odd places as limbs. I also discuss smaller-scale examples of "conver­gence," reinterpreted as parallelism, for even more precise similarities among separate lineages within coherent clades — particularly the independent con­version of thoracic limbs to maxillipeds, by identical homeotic changes in the same Hox genes, in several groups of crustaceans. Finally, I caution against Overextension and overenthusiasm by pointing out that genuine developmen­tal homologies may be far too broad in design, and far too unspecific in mor­phology, to merit a designation as parallelism, as in the role of distal-less in regulating "outpouchings" so generalized in basic structure, yet so different in form, as annelid parapodia, tunicate ampullae and echinoderm tube feet. I designate these overly broad similarities (that should not be designated as parallelism, or used as evidence for constraint by internal channeling) as "Pharaonic bricks" — that is, building blocks of such generality and multi­purpose utility that they cannot be labeled as constraints (with the obvious reductio ad absurdum of DNA as the homological basis of all life). By con­trast, the "Corinthian columns" of more specific conservations define the proper category of important positive constraint by internal channelings of parallelism based on homology of underlying regulators (just as the specific form of a Corinthian column, with its acanthus-leafed capital, represents a tightly constrained historical lineage that strongly influences the particular shape and utility of the entire resulting building).

第二个主题强调了平行性在进化中的积极作用。通过共同作用的深度同源性调节因子，远缘的生物类群可以沿着相似的适应径向进化，从而更容易产生变化。这样的现象与扩展的达尔文理论是一致的，而不是对自然选择的对立或否定。我讨论了一些广泛的例子，例如在通常被认为是经典趋同现象的节肢动物、脊椎动物和头足类动物的眼睛发育中，发现了显著的平行性。虽然成年个体的外表特征主要表现为趋同，但底层的调节因子的同源性显示了平行性在内部的强大引导作用。实际上，脊椎动物和鱿鱼的 Pax-6 基因都可以促进果蝇眼睛的发育，并在像肢体这样不寻常的地方产生眼睛。我还讨论了在更小的范围内，被重新解释为平行性的「趋同」例子，例如在几个甲壳类群中，通过相同的 Hox 基因的同源异位变化，将胸肢转变为颚足。最后，我提醒大家不要过度解读这些现象，真正的发育同源性可能在设计上过于宽泛，形态上过于不具体，不足以被视为平行性。例如，在调节「突出物」如环节动物的侧足、被囊动物的壶腹和棘皮动物的管足时，其基本结构虽然普遍，但形式上差异很大。我将这些不应被视为平行性的广泛相似性称为「法老砖」，即用途广泛的基本构件，而不是限制的标志。相比之下，「科林斯柱」这样的具体保守性则定义了通过同源性调节因子的平行性内部引导的重要正面限制，就像科林斯柱独特的形状和功能影响了整个建筑的设计一样。

7 My third and shorter theme — for this subject, though "classical" throughout the history of evolutionary thought, holds, I believe, less validity and scope than the others — treats the role of homologous regulators in pro­ducing rapid, even truly saltational, changes channeled into limited possibili­ties of developmental pathways (as in Goldschmidt's defense of discontinuous evolution based upon mutations in rate genes that control ontogenetic trajec­tories). I discuss the false arguments often invoked to infer such saltational changes, but then document some limited, but occasionally important, cases of such discontinuous, but strongly channeled, change in macroevolution.

我的第三个主题较短，虽然在进化思想的历史中一直被视为「经典」，但我认为其有效性和适用范围不如其他主题。这个主题探讨了同源调节因子在快速甚至跃变变化中的作用，这些变化被限制在有限的发展路径中。正如 Goldschmidt 通过控制发育轨迹的速率基因突变来支持间断进化一样。我还讨论了常被用来推断这种跃变变化的错误论点，但也记录了一些有限但重要的间断且高度引导的宏观进化变化案例。

8 The fourth theme of top-down channeling from full ancestral comple­ments, rather than bottom-up accretion along effectively unconstrained path­ways of local adaptation, explores the role of positive constraint in establish­ing the markedly non-random and inhomogeneous population of potential morphospace by actual organisms throughout the history of life. Ed Lewis, in brilliantly elucidating the action of Hox genes in the development of Drosophila, quite understandably assumed (albeit falsely, as we later discov­ered to our surprise) that evolution from initial homonomy to increasing complexity of AP differentiation had been achieved by addition of Hox genes, particularly to suppress abdominal legs and convert the second pair of wings to halteres. In fact, the opposite process of tinkering with established rules, primarily by increased localization of action and differentiation in tim­ing (and also by duplication of sets, at least for vertebrate Hox genes), has largely established the increasing diversity and complexity of differentiation in bilaterian phyla. The (presumably quite homonomous) common ancestor of arthropods and vertebrates already possessed a full complement of Hox genes, and even the bilaterian common ancestor already possessed at least seven elements of the set. Moreover, the genomes of the most homonomous modern groups of onycophorans and myriapods also include a full set of Hox genes — so differentiation of phenotypic complexity must originate as a de­rived feature of Hox action, exapted from a different initial role. The Cam­brian explosion remains a crucial and genuine phenomenon of phenotypic diversification, a conclusion unthreatened by a putatively earlier common an­cestry of animal phyla in a strictly genealogical (not phenotypic) sense. The further evolution of admittedly luxuriant, even awesome, variety in major phyla of complex animals has followed definite pathways of internal channel­ing, positively abetted (as much as negatively constrained) by homologous developmental rules acting as potentiators for more rapid and effective selec­tion (as in the loss of snake limbs and iteration of prepelvic segments), and not as brakes or limitations upon Darwinian efficacy.

第八个主题讨论了在生命历史中，生物体如何通过自上而下的引导（而不是通过局部适应的自由路径逐步积累）来形成一种显著的非随机且不均匀的形态空间的种群。Ed Lewis 在解释 Hox 基因在果蝇发育中的作用时，曾合理地假设（尽管后来我们惊讶地发现这是错误的），进化是通过增加 Hox 基因来实现的，特别是为了抑制腹部的腿和将第二对翅膀转变为平衡器。然而，实际上是通过对既定规则的调整，尤其是增加作用的局部化和时间上的分化（至少对于脊椎动物的 Hox 基因还包括基因组的复制），推动了两侧对称动物门中分化的多样性和复杂性。节肢动物和脊椎动物的共同祖先已经拥有完整的 Hox 基因组，甚至两侧对称动物的共同祖先至少也拥有七个 Hox 基因元素。此外，现代同构性较高的有爪动物和多足动物的基因组也包含完整的 Hox 基因组 —— 因此，表型复杂性的分化源于 Hox 基因作用的派生特征，而不是其初始功能。寒武纪大爆发仍然是一个关键的表型多样化现象，这一观点并未因动物门可能拥有更早的共同祖先而受到影响（这一更早的共同祖先是从谱系学角度，而非表型上定义的）。进一步的进化展现出复杂动物门种类的显著多样性，遵循着特定的内部引导路径，并且积极地受到同源发育规则的支持，这些规则促进了更快速和有效的选择（例如蛇类失去四肢和腹前段的重复），而并非对达尔文进化效能的限制。

Chapter 11: The integration of constraint and adaptation: structural constraints, spandrels, and exaptation

1 D'Arcy Thompson's idiosyncratic, but brilliantly crafted and expressed, theory of form (1917,1942) presents a 20th century prototype for the generalist, or ahistorical, form of structural constraint: adaptation produced not by a functionalist mechanism like natural selection (or Lamarckism), but di­rectly and automatically impressed by physical forces operating under invari­ant laws of nature. This theory enjoyed some success in explaining the corre­lation of form and function in very simple and labile forms (particularly as influenced by scale-bound changes in surface/volume ratios). But similarly nongenetic (and nonphyletic) explanations do not apply to complex creatures, and even D'Arcy Thompson admitted that his mechanism could not encompass, say, "hipponess," but, at most, only the smooth transformations of these basic designs among closely related forms of similar Bauplan (the true theoretical significance of his much misunderstood theory of transformed coordinates). In summary, D'Arcy Thompson, the great student of Aristotle, erred in mixing the master's modes of causality — by assuming that the adap­tive value (or final cause) of well designed morphology could specify the physical forces (or efficient causes) that actually built the structures.

D'Arcy Thompson 在 1917 年和 1942 年提出的一种独特而精妙的形态理论，为 20 世纪的结构约束提供了一个通用或非历史的原型。这种适应性并不是通过自然选择或拉马克主义等功能主义机制产生的，而是直接且自动地受到不变自然法则下作用的物理力量的影响。该理论在解释非常简单和易变的形态中，形态与功能的相关性方面取得了一些成功，尤其是在受到尺度限制的表面积与体积比变化的影响时。然而，这种非遗传和非系统发育的解释并不适用于复杂生物。即使是 D'Arcy Thompson 也承认，他的机制无法解释诸如「马的特性」这样的复杂性，最多只能描述在具有相似基本结构的密切相关形态中，如何实现这些基础设计的平滑转变（这就是他的坐标变换理论真正的理论意义，尽管这一理论常被误解）。总之，D'Arcy Thompson 作为亚里士多德的伟大学生，在将大师的因果模式混合时犯了错误，即假设设计良好的形态的适应价值（或最终目的）可以指定实际构建结构的物理力量（或有效原因）。

2 Stuart Kauffman and Brian Goodwin have presented the most cogent modern arguments in this tradition of direct physical causation. These argu­ments hold substantial power for explaining some features of relatively sim­ple biological systems, say from life's beginnings to the origin of prokaryotic cells, where basic organic chemistry and the physics of self-organizing sys­tems can play out their timeless and general rules. Such models also have sub­stantial utility in describing very broad features of the ecology and energy dynamics of living systems in general terms that transcend any particular taxonomic composition. But this approach founders, as did D'Arcy Thompson's as well, when the contingent and phyletically bound histories of particular complex lineages fall under scrutiny — and such systems do constitute the "bread and butter" of macroevolution. Nonetheless, Kauffman's powerful notion of "order for free," or adaptive configurations that emerge from the ahistoric (even abiological) nature of systems, and need not be explained by particular invocations of some functional force like natural selection, should give us pause before we speculate about Darwinian causes only from evidence of functionality. This "order for free" aids, and does not confute, such func­tional forces as selection by providing easier (even automatic) pathways to­wards a common desideratum of adaptive biological systems.

2 Stuart Kauffman 和 Brian Goodwin 在直接物理因果关系的理论传统中提出了最有说服力的现代论点。这些论点在解释一些相对简单的生物系统特征时具有很大说服力，比如从生命的起源到原核细胞的产生，这些过程中基础有机化学和自组织系统的物理学规律可以发挥作用。这类模型在描述生态学和生物系统能量动态的广泛特征时也非常实用，这些特征超越了任何特定分类组成的限制。然而，这种方法，如同 D'Arcy Thompson 的方法一样，在研究特定复杂谱系的偶然和系统发育历史时遇到了困难，而这些系统确实构成了宏观进化的核心内容。尽管如此，Kauffman 强有力的「免费秩序」概念，即从系统的非历史性（甚至非生物性）特征中出现的适应性配置，并不需要通过某些功能性力量（如自然选择）的特定应用来解释，这应该让我们在仅凭功能性证据推测达尔文原因之前三思。这种「免费秩序」通过为适应性生物系统的共同目标提供更简单（甚至自动）的途径，有助于而不是反驳诸如选择这样的功能性力量。

3 I then turn to the second, and (in my judgment) far more important, theme of structural constraint in the fully historicist and phyletic context of aptive evolution by cooptation of structures already present for other reasons (often nonadaptive in their origin), rather than by direct adaptation for cur­rent function via natural selection. The central principle of a fundamental logical difference between reasons for historical origin and current functional utility — a vital component in all historical analysis, as clearly recognized but insufficiently emphasized by Darwin, and then unfortunately underplayed or forgotten by later acolytes — was brilliantly identified and dissected by Friedrich Nietzsche in his Genealogy of Morals, where he contrasted the ori­gin of punishment in a primal will to power, with the (often very different) utility of punishment in our current social and political systems.

接下来，我要讨论第二个主题。在完全历史主义和谱系背景下，通过结构共用（即利用已有结构进行适应性进化，而非通过自然选择直接适应当前功能）的过程中，结构约束显得尤为重要。历史起源的原因与当前功能效用之间存在基本逻辑差异的原则，这是所有历史分析中的关键组成部分。虽然达尔文对此有清晰的认识，但他未能充分强调这一点，后来这一原则不幸被他的追随者忽视或遗忘。Friedrich Nietzsche 在《道德的谱系》中对此进行了精彩的分析，他对比了惩罚起源于原始的权力意志与在现代社会和政治体系中惩罚的效用（常常非常不同）。

4 Darwin himself invoked this principle of disconnection between histori­cal origin and current utility both in the Origin's first edition, and particularly in later responses to St. George Mivart's critique (the basis for the only chap­ter that Darwin added to later editions of the Origin) on the supposed inabil­ity of natural selection to explain the incipient (and apparently useless) stages of adaptive structures. Darwin asserted the principle of functional shift to ar­gue that, although incipient stages could not have functioned in the manner of their final form, they might still have arisen by natural selection for a dif­ferent initial utility (feathers first evolved for thermoregulation and later co-opted for flight, for example). Darwin used this principle of cooptation, or functional shift, in two important ways that enriched and expanded his the­ory away from a caricatured panselectionist version — as the primary ground of historical contingency in phyletic sequences (for one cannot predict the di­rection of subsequent cooptation from different primary utilities), and as a source of structural constraint upon evolutionary pathways. But these Dar­winian invocations stopped short of a radical claim for frequent and impor­tant nonadaptive origins of structures co-opted to later utility. That is, Darwin rarely proceeded beyond the principle of originally adaptive origin for differ­ent function, with later cooptation to altered utility.

达尔文在《物种起源》的第一版中，以及在后来回应圣乔治·米瓦特的批评时，提出了历史起源与当前功能之间的「断裂」概念。米瓦特批评自然选择无法解释那些适应性结构的初始阶段，因为这些阶段看似不起作用。达尔文提出了「功能转变」的原则，认为即使这些初始阶段无法以最终形式发挥作用，它们仍可能因其他初始功能而通过自然选择出现。例如，羽毛最初可能是为了调节体温进化而来，后来才用于飞行。

达尔文通过两种重要方式应用了这种「功能转变」或「借用」的原则，使他的理论更加丰富和全面，避免了被简化为单一的选择主义。他认为这种原则是系统进化过程中历史偶然性的基础，因为我们无法预测从不同的初始功能到后来的借用方向。此外，它还为进化路径提供了结构上的限制。然而，达尔文本人并没有走得更远，去主张那些结构常常因非适应性原因出现，并在后来被借用于其他用途。换句话说，达尔文很少超越这样的观点：结构最初是为了某种适应功能而起源的，之后才被用于其他用途。

5 This important principle of cooptation of preexisting structures origi­nally built for different reasons has been so underemphasized in Darwinian traditions that the language of evolutionary theory does not even include a term for this central process — which Elisabeth Vrba and I called "exaptation" (Gould and Vrba, 1982). (The available, but generally disfavored, term "pre-adaptation" only speaks of potential before the fact, and has been widely re­jected in any case for its unfortunate, but inevitable, linguistic implication of foreordination in evolution, the very opposite of the intended meaning!)

在达尔文传统中，对于将原本因不同目的而建的结构重新利用的这一重要原则，重视程度一直不够，以至于在进化理论的术语中甚至没有一个词来描述这一核心过程 ——Elisabeth Vrba 和我称之为「适应性迁移（exaptation)」（Gould 和 Vrba，1982）。而现有的术语「预适应（pre-adaptation)」虽然存在，但常被弃用，因为它仅在事前谈论潜力，并且由于其不可避免地暗示进化的预定性，这与其真正的含义背道而驰。

6 I present a list of criteria for recognizing exaptations and separating them from true adaptations. I also discuss some outstanding examples of exaptation from the recent literature, with particular emphasis on the multi­ple exaptation of lens crystallins (in part for their fortuitous transparency, but for many other cooptable characteristics as well) in so many vertebrates and from so many independent and different original functions.

我提出了一系列标准，用于识别适应前特征（exaptations）并将其与真正的适应区分开来。我还讨论了一些近期文献中突出的适应前特征例子，特别强调在许多脊椎动物中，晶状体蛋白的多重适应前特征。这不仅因为其天然的透明性，还因为其许多其他可被利用的特性，这些特性源于许多独立且不同的原始功能。

7 The exaptation of structures that arose for different adaptive reasons remains within selectionist orthodoxy (while granting structural constraint a large influence over historical pathways, in contrast with crude panadaptationism) by confirming a Darwinian basis for the adaptive origin of struc­tures, whatever their later history of exaptive shift. On the other hand, the theoretically radical version of this second, or historicist, style of structural constraint in evolution posits an important role for an additional phenome­non in macroevolution: the truly nonadaptive origin of structures that may later be exapted for subsequent utility. Many sources of such nonadaptive origin may be specified (see point 10 below), but inevitable architectural con­sequences of other features — the spandrels of Gould and Lewontin's termi­nology (1979) — probably rank as most frequent and most important in the history of lineages.

那些由于不同适应原因而产生的结构，其被适应性利用的过程仍然符合选择主义的传统观点。虽然承认结构约束对进化历史有很大影响，但它也确认了这些结构具有达尔文式的适应性起源，不论其后来的变化如何。另一方面，进化中另一种历史主义的结构约束理论则更为激进，认为在宏观进化中存在一种重要现象：某些结构可能最初并非出于适应性原因而产生，但后来却被利用。这样的非适应性起源有多种来源（详见下文第 10 点），但最常见和重要的可能是其他特征不可避免的建筑后果 —— 即 Gould 和 Lewontin 在 1979 年提出的「拱肩」现象。

8 Spandrels (although unnamed and ungeneralized) have been acknowl­edged in Darwinian traditions, but relegated to insignificant relative frequen­cies by invalid arguments for their rarity, their structural inconsequentiality (the mold marks on an old bottle, for example), or their temporally subse­quent status as sequelae — with the first two claims empirically false, and the last claim logically false as a further confusion between historical origin and current utility.

在达尔文的传统中，承认了 8 个所谓的「副产品结构」(Spandrels），但由于对其稀有性的错误论证、认为它们结构上无关紧要（比如将其比作旧瓶子上的模具痕迹），或者因为它们是后续现象而不被重视。其中，前两个理由在实际观察中不成立，而最后一个理由则在逻辑上错误，因为它混淆了历史起源和当前用途。

9 I affirm the importance and high relative frequency of spandrels, and therefore of nonadaptive origin, in evolutionary theory by two major argu­ments for ubiquity. First, for intrinsic structural reasons, the number of po­tential spandrels greatly increases as organisms and their traits become more complex. (The spandrels of the human brain must greatly outnumber the im­mediately adaptive reasons for increase in size; the spandrels of the cylindri­cal umbilical space of a gastropod shell, by contrast, may be far more limited, although exaptive use as a brooding chamber has been important in several lineages.) Second, under hierarchical models of selection, features evolved for any reason at one level generate automatic consequences at other levels — and these consequences can only be classified as cross-level spandrels (since they are "injected into" the new level, rather than actively evolved there).

我通过两个主要论点强调了进化理论中「拱璧」（spandrels，指非适应性的特征）的重要性和普遍性。首先，由于生物体及其特征随着复杂性增加，潜在的「拱璧」数量也随之增多。例如，人类大脑中非直接适应性产生的特征多于其体积增大的直接适应性原因；而相比之下，蜗牛壳的圆形空间内的「拱璧」可能较少，尽管在某些种系中，这些空间被用作孵蛋室却非常重要。其次，根据分层选择模型，在某一层级因各种原因进化出的特征，会在其他层级自动产生影响，而这些影响只能被称为跨层级的「拱璧」，因为它们是被「引入」新层级的，而不是在该层级主动进化出来的。

10 The full classification of spandrels and modes of exaptation offers a resolving taxonomy and solution — primarily through the key concept of the "exaptive pool" — for the compelling and heretofore confusing (yet much discussed) problem of "evolvability." Former confusion has centered upon the apparent paradox that ordinary organismal selection, the supposed ca­nonical mechanism of evolutionary change, would seem (at least as its pri­mary overt effect) to restrict and limit future possibilities by specializing forms to complexities of immediate environments, and therefore to act against an "evolvability" that largely defines the future macroevolutionary prospects of any lineage. The solution lies in recognizing that spandrels, al­though architecturally consequential, are not doomed to a secondary or un­important status thereby. Spandrels, and all other forms of exaptive potential, define the ground of evolvability, and play as important a role in macro-evolutionary potential as conventional adaptation does for the immediacy of microevolutionary success. I emphasize the centrality of the exaptive pool for solving the problem of evolvability by presenting a full taxonomy of catego­ries for the pool's richness, focusing on a primary distinction between "frank­lins" (or inherent potentials of structures evolved for other adaptive roles — that is, the classical Darwinian functional shifts that do not depart from adaptationism), and "miltons" (or true nonadaptations, arising from several sources, with spandrels as a primary category, and then available for later cooptation from the exaptive pool — that is, the class of nonadaptive origins that does challenge the dominant role of panadaptationism in evolutionary theory).

关于拱璧和重适应模式的全面分类，通过「重适应库」这一关键概念，提供了一种解决「进化能力」这一长期困扰的问题的办法。过去的困惑主要在于一个显而易见的悖论：通常的生物选择，作为进化变化的典型机制，似乎通过让生物的形态专门适应当下的环境来限制未来的可能性，从而与定义任何谱系未来宏观进化前景的「进化能力」相对立。解决方案在于认识到，尽管拱璧在建筑上有重要影响，并不因此处于次要或不重要的位置。事实上，拱璧和其他形式的重适应潜力共同定义了进化能力的基础，它们在宏观进化潜力中发挥着与传统适应在微观进化成功中同样重要的作用。通过展示「重适应库」的丰富性分类，我强调其在解决「进化能力」问题中的核心地位，尤其是「弗兰克林」和「米尔顿」之间的主要区别。「弗兰克林」指的是那些为其他适应角色而进化的结构的潜在功能 —— 即经典的达尔文功能转变，不偏离适应理论；而「米尔顿」则指真正的非适应性特征，这些特征可能由多种来源形成，拱璧是其中的一个主要类别，并且可以在之后从重适应库中被选择和利用 —— 这是对进化理论中泛适应主义主导地位的挑战。

11 I argue that the concept of cross-level spandrels vastly increases the range, power and importance of nonadaptation in evolution, and also unites the two central themes of this book by showing how the hierarchically ex­panded theory of selection also implies a greatly increased scope for non-adaptive structural constraint as an important factor in the potentiation of macroevolution.

我认为，跨层次的「副产品」概念极大地拓展了进化中非适应性因素的影响力和重要性。它通过展示层级扩展的选择理论如何揭示非适应性结构约束在促进宏观进化中的重要作用，将本书的两个核心主题联系在了一起。

Chapter 12: Tiers of time and trials of extrapolationism

1 Darwin clearly recognized the threat of catastrophic mass extinction to the extrapolationist and uniformitarian premises underlying his claim for full explanation of macroevolutionary results by microevolutionary causes (and not as a challenge to the efficacy of natural selection itself). Darwin therefore employed his usual argument about the imperfection of geological records to "spread out" apparent mass extinction over sufficient time for resolution by ordinary processes working at maximal rates (and therefore only increasing the intensity of selection).

第 12 章：时间的层次与外推主义的考验

1 达尔文认识到，灾难性的大规模灭绝对他的外推主义和均变论构成了威胁，这些理论是他用微观进化原因解释宏观进化结果的基础（这并不是对自然选择有效性的质疑）。因此，达尔文通过提出地质记录不完整的观点，来解释这些看似突然的大规模灭绝事件。他认为这些事件实际上是分布在较长的时间段内，通过普通进化过程以最高速率发生的（因此只是增加了选择的强度）。

2 The transition of the impact scenario (as a catastrophic trigger for the K-T extinction) from apostasy at its proposal in 1980 to effective factuality (based on the consilience of disparate evidence from iridium layers, shocked quartz and, especially, the discovery of a crater of appropriate size and age at Chicxulub) has reinstated the global paroxysms of classical catastrophism (in its genuinely scientific form, not its dismissive Lyellian caricature) as a legiti­mate scientific mechanism outside the Darwinian paradigm, but operating in conjunction with Darwinian forces to generate the full pattern of life's his­tory, and not, as previously (and unhelpfully) formulated, as an exclusive al­ternative to disprove or to trivialize Darwinian mechanisms.

影响情景作为 K-T 灭绝的灾难性触发因素，从 1980 年提出的非主流观点，逐渐过渡到基于多种证据 —— 如铱层、震动石英，特别是在 Chicxulub 发现大小和年龄合适的陨石坑 —— 的验证，成为被广泛接受的事实。这一转变使得经典的灾变论（以科学的方式，而非被轻视的莱尔式刻板印象）重新成为一种公认的科学机制。虽然这种机制超出了达尔文学说的范畴，但它与达尔文的理论共同作用，形成了生命历史的完整模式，而不是像过去那样被视为达尔文机制的唯一替代品，以反驳或削弱达尔文的理论。

3 If catastrophic causes and triggers for mass extinction prove to be gen­eral, or at least predominant in relative frequency (and not just peculiar to the K-T event), then this macroevolutionary phenomenon will challenge the cru­cial extrapolationist premise of Darwinism by being more frequent, more rapid, more intense and more different in effect than Darwinian biology (and Lyellian geology) can allow. Under truly catastrophic models, two sets of reasons, inconsistent with Darwinian extrapolationism by microevolu­tionary accumulation, become potentially important agents of macroevolu­tionary patterning: effectively random extinction (for clades of low N), and, more importantly, extinction under "different rules" from reasons regulating the adaptive origin and success of autapomorphic cladal features in normal times.

如果灾难性的原因和触发因素被证明是普遍存在的，或者至少在相对上更为常见（不仅仅是 K-T 事件独有的），那么这种宏观进化现象可能会对达尔文主义的关键理论假设构成挑战。因为这种现象可能比达尔文的生物学和莱尔的地质学所能解释的更频繁、更迅速、更强烈并且结果有很大不同。在真正的灾难性模型中，有两类因素可能成为宏观进化模式的重要参与者，这两类因素与达尔文主义通过微观进化积累来外推的不一致：一是对于数量较少的谱系，可能发生的随机灭绝；二是更为重要的，在「不同规则」下的灭绝，这些规则与正常情况下谱系特征的适应性起源和成功的调节方式是不同的。

4 Catastrophic mass extinction, while breaking the extrapolationist credo, may suggest an overly simplified and dichotomous macroevolutionary model based on alternating regimes of "background" vs. "mass" extinction. Rather, we should expand this insight about distinctive mechanisms at different scales into a more general model of several rising tiers of time — with conven­tional Darwinian microevolution dominating at the ecological tier of short times and intraspecific dynamics; punctuated equilibrium dominating at the geological tier of phyletic trends based on interspecific dynamics (with species arising in geological moments, and then treated as stable "atoms," or basic units of macroevolution, analogous to organisms in microevolution); and mass extinction (perhaps often catastrophic) acting as a major force of over­all macroevolutionary pattern in the global history of relative waxing and waning of clades. (I also contrast this preferred model of time's tiering with the other possible style of explanation, which I reject but find interesting nonetheless, for denying full generality to smooth Darwinian upward extrap­olation from the lowest level — namely, an equally smooth and monistic downward extrapolation from catastrophic mortality in mass extinction to diminishing, but equally random and sudden, effects at all scales, as proposed in Raup's "field of bullets" model.)

灾难性的大规模灭绝事件，虽然打破了简单推断的信条，但可能暗示了一种过于简化的宏观进化模型，将生物进化过程分为「背景」灭绝与「大规模」灭绝两种交替机制。然而，我们不应止步于此，而是应该将对不同尺度下独特机制的理解扩展到一个更广泛的时间层次模型。在这个模型中，短期和种内动态的生态层面上，传统的达尔文微观进化占据主导地位；在地质时间尺度上，基于种间动态的进化模式中，间断平衡理论起主导作用（在这期间，物种在地质上迅速出现，然后作为宏观进化的基本单位保持稳定，类似于微观进化中的个体生物）；而大规模灭绝（可能常常是灾难性的）则成为在全球生物类群兴衰的宏观进化模式中的主要力量。我还将这种时间分层模型与另一种可能的解释进行对比，尽管我不赞成这种解释，但仍然认为它有趣，因为它否认了从低层次到高层次的平滑达尔文进化的普遍性 —— 即从大规模灭绝中的灾难性死亡，向所有尺度上递减但仍然随机和突发的影响进行同样平滑的单一性推断，这就是 Raup 提出的「子弹场」模型。

5 In a paradoxical epilogue, I argue (despite my role as a longtime cham­pion of the importance and scientific respectability of unpredictable con­tingency in the explanation of historical patterns) that the enlargement and reformulation of Darwinism, as proposed in this book, will recapture for gen­eral theory (by adding a distinctive and irreducible set of macroevolutionary causes to our armamentarium of evolutionary principles) a large part of macroevolutionary pattern that Darwin himself, as an equally firm supporter of contingency, willingly granted to the realm of historical unpredictability because he could not encompass these results within his own limited causal structure of strict reliance upon smooth extrapolation from microevolutionary processes by accumulation through the immensity of geological time.

在一个看似矛盾的结尾中，我想要表达的是，尽管我一直以来都支持在解释历史模式时不可预测的偶然性的重要性和科学性，但本书提出的达尔文主义的扩展和重新表述，将通过在我们的进化理论中加入一组独特且不可简化的宏观进化原因，为一般理论重新捕获大量的宏观进化模式。达尔文本人也是偶然性的坚定支持者，他乐于将这些现象归入历史不可预测性的领域，因为他无法在自己有限的因果结构中解释这些结果，这种结构严格依赖于通过漫长地质时间的积累，从微观进化过程进行的线性推演。

A FINAL THOUGHT. May I simply end by quoting the line that I wrote at the completion of a similar abstract (but vastly shorter, in a much less weighty book) for my first technical tome, Ontogeny and Phylogeny (1977b, p. 9): "This epitome is a pitiful abbreviation of a much longer and, I hope, more subtle development. Please read the book!"

最后，我想引用我在完成第一本技术专著《Ontogeny and Phylogeny》（1977b，第 9 页）时写下的一句话来结束这段话：「这个摘要只是对更长且我希望更精妙的内容的简单缩写。请阅读这本书！」
