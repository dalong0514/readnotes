## 0201The Essence of Darwinism and the Basis of Modern Orthodoxy: An Exegesis of the Origin of Species

达尔文主义的核心与现代正统理论的基础：解读《物种起源》

### 2.1 A Revolution in the Small

微观革命

Our theatrical and literary standards recognize only a few basic types of heroes. Most are preeminently strong and brave; some, in an occasional bone thrown to the marginal world of intellectuals, may even be allowed to tri­umph by brilliance. But one small section of the pantheon has long been re­served for a sideshow of improbables: the meek, the mild, the foolish, the insignificant, the ornamental — in short, for characters so disdained that they pass beneath notice and become demons of effectiveness by their invisibility. Consider the secretaries or chauffeurs who learn essential secrets because pa­trician bosses scarcely acknowledge their personhood and say almost any­thing in their presence; or the pageboys and schoolgirls who walk unnoticed through enemy lines with essential messages to partisans in conquered terri­tories.

在我们的戏剧和文学中，英雄通常只有几种基本类型。大多数英雄都是极其强壮和勇敢的；有些英雄偶尔会在知识分子的世界中，因为他们的聪明才智而取得成功。然而，在英雄的世界中，还有一个小角落留给了一些不太可能的角色：温顺的、柔弱的、看似愚蠢的、无足轻重的，或者只是作为装饰存在的角色 —— 这些角色常常被忽视，但正因为他们的不被注意，反而在关键时刻展现出惊人的效率。例如，那些秘书或司机，由于贵族老板几乎不把他们当回事，在他们面前无所顾忌地谈论机密，因此掌握了重要的秘密；又如，那些侍童和女学生，能够在敌人眼皮底下不被察觉地穿梭，在被占领区内传递重要信息给抵抗组织。

Though few scholars have considered the issue in this light, I would argue that the intellectual agent of Darwin's victory falls into this anomalous cate­gory. To be sure, Darwin succeeded because he devised a mechanism, natural selection that possessed an unbeatable combination of testability and truth. But, at a more general level, Darwin triumphed by allowing the formerly meek to inherit the entire world of evolutionary theory.

虽然很少有学者从这个角度来看待这一问题，但我认为，达尔文胜利的智力因素属于这一特殊类别。毫无疑问，达尔文之所以成功，是因为他提出了自然选择这一机制，它结合了可测试性和真实性这两个无与伦比的特点。然而，从更广泛的层面来看，达尔文的成功在于，他让那些曾经被忽视的群体在整个进化理论界占据了主导地位。

Darwin's theory explicitly rejected and overturned the two evolutionary systems well known in Britain during his time (see next chapter for details) — Lamarck's (via Lyell`s exegesis in the Principles of Geology) and Chambers's (in the anonymously printed Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation). Both these theories sunk a deep root in the most powerful of cultural biases by describing evolution as an interaction of two opposing forces. The first — considered dominant, intrinsic and fundamental — yielded progress on the old euphonious (and sexist) theme of "the march from monad to man." The sec­ond — designated as secondary, diversionary and superimposed — interrupted the upward flow and produced lateral dead-ends of specialized adaptations, from eyeless moles to long necked giraffes. Darwin, in his greatest stroke of genius, took this secondary force, proposed a new mechanism for its opera­tion (natural selection), and then redefined this former source for superficial tinkering as fully sufficient to render all of evolution — thus branding the sep­arate and more exalted force of progress as illusory.

达尔文的理论明确拒绝并推翻了他那个时代在英国广为人知的两种进化理论（详细信息请见下一章）—— 拉马克的理论（通过莱尔在《地质学原理》中的阐述）和钱伯斯的理论（在匿名出版的《创造自然史的遗迹》中）。这两种理论通过将进化描述为两种对立力量的相互作用而深深植根于当时的文化偏见。第一种力量被认为是主导的、内在的和基本的，推动了那个时代悦耳但带有性别歧视的「从单细胞生物到人类的进化」主题。第二种力量则被认为是次要的、分散注意力的和附加的，它中断了向上的进化流并导致了特定适应的横向终点，如无眼的鼹鼠和长颈的长颈鹿。达尔文在他最大的天才之作中，利用了这一第二种力量，提出了一个新的运作机制（自然选择），并将这一曾经被认为是表面改动的来源重新定义为完全足以解释所有进化的力量，从而将所谓的更为崇高的进步力量视为幻觉。

Such an argument poses an obvious logical dilemma: how can such power be granted to a force formerly viewed as so inconsequential? After all, evolu­tion must still construct the full pageant of life's history and the entire taxonomic panorama, even if we abandon the concept of linear order. Darwin's answer records the depth of his debt to Lyell, the man more responsible than any other for shaping Darwin's basic view of nature. Time, just time! (pro­vided that the "inconsequential" force of adaptation can work without limit, accumulating its tiny effects through geological immensity). The theory's full richness cannot be exhausted by the common statement that Darwinism pre­sents a biological version of the "uniformitarianism" championed by Lyell for geology, but I cannot think of a more accurate or more encompassing one-liner. (In a revealing letter to Leonard Horner, written in 1844, Darwin ex­claimed: "I always feel as if my books came half out of Lyell's brains ... for I have always thought that the great merit of the Principles [of Geology], was that it altered the whole tone of one's mind and therefore that when seeing a thing never seen by Lyell, one yet saw it partially through his eyes" (cited in Darwin, 1987, p. 55).)

这样的论点提出了一个显而易见的逻辑矛盾：为什么以前被视为无关紧要的力量现在能获得如此大的权力？毕竟，即使我们不采用线性发展的概念，进化仍需描绘生命历史的全貌和完整的分类视角。达尔文对此的回答显示了他对莱尔的深刻影响，莱尔是对达尔文的自然观念影响最大的人。时间，只是时间！只要适应这一「无关紧要」的力量可以无限制地发挥作用，并在漫长的地质时间中积累其微小的效果。这个理论的丰富性不仅仅在于常说的达尔文主义是莱尔为地质学提倡的「均变论」的生物学版本，但我想不出比这更准确或更全面的描述。（在 1844 年写给伦纳德·霍纳的信中，达尔文曾感慨：「我总觉得我的书有一半是从莱尔的脑子里出来的…… 因为我一直认为《地质学原理》的伟大之处在于它改变了一个人的思维方式，因此，当看到莱尔未曾见过的事物时，仍然能部分地通过他的视角去观察」（引用自达尔文，1987 年，第 55 页）。）

Darwin, in his struggle to formulate an evolutionary mechanism during his annus mirabilis (actually a bit more than two years) between the docking of the Beagle and the Malthusian insight of late 1838, had embraced, but ulti­mately rejected, a variety of contrary theories — including saltation, inher­ently adaptive variation, and intrinsic senescence of species (see Gruber and Barrett, 1974; Kohn, 1980). A common thread unites all these abandoned ap­proaches: for they all postulate an internal drive based either on large pushes from variation (saltationism) or on inherent directionality of change. Most use ontogenetic metaphors, and make evolution as inevitable and as pur­poseful as development. Natural selection, by contrast, relies entirely upon small, isotropic, nondirectional variation as raw material, and views exten­sive transformation as the accumulation of tiny changes wrought by struggle between organisms and their (largely biotic) environment. Trial and error, one step at a time, becomes the central metaphor of Darwinism.

达尔文在他所谓的「奇迹年」中努力制定进化机制，这段时间从小猎犬号靠岸到 1838 年末他受到马尔萨斯启发，实际上持续了两年多一点的时间。在此期间，他曾拥抱但最终拒绝了多种相互矛盾的理论，包括跳跃学说、固有的适应性变异和物种的内在衰老（见 Gruber 和 Barrett，1974；Kohn，1980）。所有这些被放弃的方法有一个共同点：它们都假设存在一种内部驱动力，要么来自巨大变异的推动（跳跃论），要么来自变化的固有方向性。这些理论大多使用个体发育的隐喻，将进化视为如同发育般不可避免且有目的的过程。相反，自然选择完全依赖于小幅度、各向同性且无方向性的变异作为原材料，并将大规模的变革视为生物与其（主要是生物的）环境斗争所导致的微小变化的积累。试错过程，一步一步地成为达尔文主义的核心隐喻。

This theme of relentless accumulation of tiny changes through immense time, the uniformitarian doctrine of Charles Lyell, served as Darwin's touch­stone throughout his intellectual life. Uniformitarianism provides the key to his first scientific book (Darwin, 1842) on the formation of coral atolls by gradual subsidence of oceanic islands, long continued. And the same theme defines the central subject of his parting shot (1881), a book on the formation of vegetable mould by earthworms. Darwin, for lifelong reasons of personal style, did not choose to write a summary or confessional in lofty philosophi­cal terms, but he did want to make an exit with guns blazing on his favorite topic. Ironically, Darwin's overt subject of worms has led to a common inter­pretation quite opposite to his own intent — his misrepresentation as a dod­dering old naturalist who couldn't judge the difference in importance between fishbait and fomenting revolution, and who, in recognizing evolution, just happened to be in the right place at the right time. In fact, Darwin's worm book presents an artfully chosen example of the deeper principle that under­lay all his work, including the discovery of evolution — the uniformitarian power of small changes cumulated over great durations. What better example than the humble worm, working literally beneath our notice, but making, grain by grain, both our best soils and the topography of England. In the pref­ace (1881, p. 6), Darwin explicitly draws the analogy to evolution by refuting the opinions of a certain Mr. Fish (wonderful name, given the context), who denied that worms could account for much "considering their weakness and their size": "Here we have an instance of that inability to sum up the effects of a continually recurrent cause, which has often retarded the progress of sci­ence, as formerly in the case of geology, and more recently in that of the prin­ciple of evolution."

查尔斯·莱尔（Charles Lyell）的均变论学说，即通过漫长时间积累微小变化的理论，一直是达尔文思想的基石。达尔文的第一本科学著作（Darwin，1842）运用了这一理论，探讨了珊瑚环礁是如何通过海洋岛屿缓慢下沉而形成的。同样的理论也成为他最后一部作品（1881 年）的核心话题，这本书研究了蚯蚓如何形成土壤。由于个人风格的缘故，达尔文选择不以高深的哲学语言总结他的思想，而是希望用他最喜爱的主题结束他的学术生涯。讽刺的是，达尔文关于蚯蚓的研究常被误解为他晚年无法区分事物重要性的表现，实际上是在正确的时机对进化论做出了重要贡献。达尔文的蚯蚓书籍实际上精心选取了一个例子，展示了他所有研究背后的深层次原则，也就是小变化在长时间内累积的力量。蚯蚓这个例子再好不过了，它们在我们视线之外默默地工作，但却一粒一粒地创造了肥沃的土壤和英国的地形。在这本书的序言中（1881 年，第 6 页），达尔文明确地将这一类比与进化论联系起来，并反驳了一位名叫菲什（Fish）的先生的观点，这位先生认为蚯蚓由于「弱小和体型」而无法产生显著影响。达尔文指出，这正是无法总结持续性微小变化效果的一个例子，而这种能力的缺乏曾多次阻碍科学进步，无论是在地质学领域还是在进化原理方面。

Darwin waxed almost messianic in advancing this theme in the Origin of Species, for he understood that readers could not grasp his argument for evo­lution until they embraced this uniformitarian vision with their hearts. He confessed the a priori improbability of his assertion, given the norms and tra­ditions of western thought: "Nothing at first can appear more difficult to be­lieve than that the more complex organs and instincts should have been per­fected, not by means superior to, though analogous with, human reason, but by the accumulation of innumerable slight variations, each good for the indi­vidual possessor" (1859, p. 459). In his short concluding section on our gen­eral reluctance to accept evolution, he did not — probably for diplomatic rea­sons — identify specific cultural or religious barriers; instead, he spoke of our unfamiliarity with the crucial uniformitarian postulate: "But the chief cause of our natural unwillingness to admit that one species has given birth to other and distinct species, is that we are always slow in admitting any great change of which we do not see the intermediate steps . . . the mind cannot possibly grasp the full meaning of the term of a hundred million years; it cannot add up and perceive the full effects of many slight variations, accumulated during an almost infinite number of generations" (1859, p. 481).

达尔文在《物种起源》中几乎以一种极富激情的方式阐述了这一主题，因为他明白，只有当读者在心灵上接受了均变论的视角后，才能真正理解他的进化论。他承认，按照西方思想的传统和规范来看，他的论点似乎不太可能：「最初，人们很难相信更复杂的器官和本能不是通过超越但类似于人类理性的方式，而是通过无数微小变化的积累，每一个变化对个体都是有益的方式来完善的。」（1859，第 459 页）。在他简短的结尾部分，讨论到我们通常不愿接受进化论时，他可能是出于外交原因，并没有指出具体的文化或宗教障碍；而是谈到了我们对关键的均变论假设的不熟悉：「但我们自然不愿承认一个物种可以演变出其他不同物种的主要原因是，我们总是难以接受那些我们看不到其间步骤的重大变化…… 人们的思维无法完全理解一亿年的全貌；也无法累积并理解在几乎无数代中积累的许多微小变化的全部效果。」（1859，第 481 页）。

To impress readers with the power of natural selection, Darwin continually stressed the cumulative effect of small changes. He reserved his best literary lines, his finest metaphors, for this linchpin of his argument — as in this famil­iar passage: "It may be said that natural selection is daily and hourly scruti­nizing, throughout the world, every variation, even the slightest; rejecting that which is bad, preserving and adding up all that is good; silently and in­sensibly working, whenever and wherever opportunity offers, at the improve­ment of each organic being in relation to its organic and inorganic conditions of life. We see nothing of these slow changes in progress, until the hand of time has marked the long lapse of ages" (1859, p. 84). Examine the smallest changes and variations, Darwin almost begs us. Let nothing pass beneath your notice. Cumulate, cumulate, and cumulate:

为了让读者理解自然选择的力量，达尔文不断强调微小变化的累积效果。他在这个关键论点上用上了他最精彩的语言和最生动的比喻 —— 比如这段广为人知的话：「可以说，自然选择每天每小时都在全球范围内仔细审视每一个变异，即使是最微小的；淘汰不良的，保留并积累有益的；只要有机会，就在任何时候、任何地方，默默地、逐渐地改进每一个有机体与其有机和无机生活条件的关系。我们无法看到这些缓慢变化的进展，直到岁月流逝得足够长久。」(1859，p. 84）达尔文几乎是在恳请我们去关注最小的变化和变异。不要忽视任何细节。积累，积累，再积累：

Certainly no clear line of demarcation has as yet been drawn between species and sub-species . . .; or, again, between sub-species and well-marked varieties, or between lesser varieties and individual differences. These differences blend into each other in an insensible series; and a se­ries impresses the mind with the idea of an actual passage. Hence I look at individual differences, though of small interest to the systematist, as of high importance for us, as being the first step towards such slight varie­ties as are barely thought worth recording in works on natural history (1859, p. 51).

目前，物种与亚种之间并没有明确的界限。同样，亚种与明显的变种，或者较小的变种与个体差异之间的界限也未被清晰界定。这些差异在一个渐变的序列中相互交融，给人一种实际渐变的印象。因此，我认为个体差异虽然对系统学家来说可能兴趣不大，但对我们来说却非常重要，因为这是迈向那些在自然历史书籍中几乎不被记录的轻微变种的第一步 （1859，p. 51）。

I need hardly stress Darwin's impact as one of the half dozen or so most revolutionary thinkers in western history. I want, instead, to emphasize a more curious aspect of his status — his continuing relevance, indeed his benev­olent hovering over almost all our current proceedings. We may revere New­ton and Lavoisier as men of equal impact, but do modern physicists and chemists actively engage the ideas of these founders, as they pursue their daily work? Darwin, on the other hand, continues to bestride our world like a colossus — so much so that I can only begin this book on the structure of evo­lutionary theory by laying out Darwin's detailed vision as a modern starting point, a current orthodoxy only lightly modified by more than a century of work. I do, in this book, advocate some major restructuring, in the light of new concepts and findings, and with the approbation of more and more col­leagues as our understanding of evolution broadens. But Darwin remains our context — and my proposed restructuring represents an extension, not a re­placement, of his vision. The hierarchical theory of selection builds a world different from Darwin's in many important respects, but we do so by ex­tending his mechanism of selection to a larger realm than he acknowledged — that is, to levels both below and above his focus on the struggle among or­ganisms.

我几乎不需要强调达尔文作为西方历史上最具革命性思想家之一的影响力。我想指出的是他地位的另一种有趣现象 —— 他在我们当前几乎所有活动中的持久影响力。我们可能会像尊敬牛顿和拉瓦锡一样尊敬达尔文，认为他们具有同等的影响力，但现代的物理学家和化学家在日常工作中是否仍然积极应用这些创始人的思想呢？然而，达尔文仍然如巨人般影响着我们的世界 —— 以至于我只能通过将达尔文的详细构想作为现代进化理论的起点来开始这本书，而这一理论在经过一个多世纪的发展后只稍作调整。我确实在书中提出了一些基于新概念和发现的重大调整，并且随着我们对进化理解的加深，这种调整得到了越来越多同事的认可。但达尔文仍然是我们的基石 —— 我所提议的调整是对他思想的延展，而不是取代。选择的层级理论在许多重要方面构建了一个与达尔文不同的世界，但我们是通过将他的选择机制扩展到更广阔的领域来实现的 —— 也就是说，不仅关注于生物之间的竞争，还涉及更高和更低的层次。

When Cassius spoke his words about Caesar (paraphrased above), he added his puzzlement at Caesar's extraordinary success: "Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed, that he is grown so great." I shall argue in this chapter that Darwin's continued, pervasive relevance arises from his capacity for revolutionary innovation at two opposite poles of scientific practice — the immediate strategy of formulating a methodology for everyday research, and the most general discussion of causes and phenomena in the natural world (the questions that will not go away, and that air continually from college bull sessions, to TV talk shows, to learned treatises on the nature of things). Dar­win's residence at both poles of immediate methodology and broadest theo­retical generality begins with his distinctive attitude towards the central im­portance of daily, palpable events in nature, and their power to account for all evolution by cumulation — hence my choice of an opening topic for this chapter (see Fig. 2-1).

当 Cassius 谈到 Caesar 时，他好奇地问：「我们的 Caesar 吃了什么肉，让他变得如此伟大。」本章中，我将论证达尔文为何仍然具有深远影响，因为他在科学的两个极端领域都展现了非凡的创新能力：一是为日常研究制定具体的方法，二是探讨自然界中普遍存在的原因和现象。这些问题从未消失过，从大学辩论、电视访谈到关于事物本质的学术论文，这些问题始终被人们讨论。达尔文之所以能在具体方法和广泛理论之间游刃有余，源于他对自然界日常事件重要性的独特见解，以及通过积累过程解释进化的能力。因此，我选择了这个作为本章的开篇主题（见图 2-1）。

Caesar voiced his suspicions of Cassius, fearing men who think too much (may all despots thus beware). But his grudging words of praise might well be invoked to epitomize the reasons for Darwin's unparalleled success: "He reads much; he is a great observer, and he looks quite through the deeds of men."

凯撒曾表达过对卡西乌斯的怀疑，担心那些过于深思熟虑的人（希望所有的暴君都能对此保持警惕）。然而，他不情愿地给予的赞美之词却恰好可以用来总结达尔文取得非凡成功的原因：「他读书广泛；他是一位出色的观察者，并且能够洞察人类的行为。」

Darwin as a Historical Methodologist

ONE LONG ARGUMENT

未找到意译内容

An old quip, highlighting the intractability of philosophical dualism, pro­claims: "what's matter? never mind; what's mind? doesn't matter." Predarwinian evolutionary systems embodied the same kind of Catch-22, this time in painful and practical terms, destined to ensnare any budding naturalist who hoped to study organisms by direct confrontation with testable hypothe­ses. Lamarck's system, for example, contrasted an intrinsic force of progress with a diversionary, and clearly secondary, force of adaptation to changing local environments. The secondary process worked in the immediate here and now, and might be engaged empirically by studies of adaptation and heredity. But the more important primary force, the source of natural order and the ul­timate cause of human mentality, lurked in the background of time's immen­sity, and at the inaccessible interior of the very nature of matter. This charac­terization creates an intolerable dilemma for anyone who holds (as Darwin did) that science must be defined as testable doing, not just noble thinking. Recalling my opening quip, Lamarck's system virtually mocked the empirical approach to science, and forestalled any growing confidence in evolution: what is important cannot be seen; what can be seen is not important.

一句古老的俏皮话曾调侃哲学二元论的复杂性：「物质是什么？别在意；思维是什么？不重要。」在达尔文之前，进化理论就像陷阱，困扰着那些希望通过实验验证假设来研究生物的早期博物学家。例如，拉马克的理论中存在一种内在的进步力量，与一种次要的、适应于变化环境的力量相对比。次要力量在当下起作用，可以通过研究适应性和遗传来进行实证研究。然而，更重要的进步力量 —— 自然秩序的来源和人类思维的最终原因，却隐藏在时间的深处和物质本质的内部。对于像达尔文这样认为科学应该以可检验实践为基础的人来说，这无疑是个无法忍受的困境。回到我开头的俏皮话，拉马克的理论似乎在嘲笑科学的实证方法，阻碍了人们对进化论信心的增强：重要的东西看不见；看得见的东西不重要。

Darwin used a brilliant argument to cut through this dilemma, thus mak­ing the study of evolution a practical science. He acknowledged Lamarck's implied claim that small scale adaptation to local environment defines the tractable subject matter of evolution. But he refuted the disabling contention that adaptation in this mode only diverted the "real" force of evolution into side channels and dead ends. And he revised previous evolutionary thinking in the most radical way — by denying that Lamarck's "real" force existed at all, and by encompassing its supposed results as consequences of the "subsid­iary" force accumulated to grandeur by the simple expedient of relentless action over sufficient time. Darwin established our profession not only by discovering a force — natural selection — that seems both powerful and true; he also, perhaps more importantly, made evolution accessible to science by granting to empiricists their most precious gifts of tractability and testability. The essence of Darwin's theory (specified in the next section) owes as much to his practical triumph at this immediate scale of daily work, as to his broadest perception that western views of nature had been seriously awry, and largely backwards.

达尔文用一个精彩的论点化解了这一难题，使得进化研究变得更加实用。他承认了拉马克所暗示的观点，即对局部环境的小规模适应定义了进化研究的具体内容。但他反驳了这种适应模式会将进化的「真正」力量引入歧途和死胡同的说法。他以最激进的方式修正了先前的进化思想 —— 否认拉马克所说的「真正」力量的存在，并将其所谓的结果视为通过持续作用积累到宏伟程度的「辅助」力量的结果。达尔文不仅通过发现自然选择这一既强大又真实的力量，为现代进化生物学奠定了基础；更重要的是，他使进化成为科学可以探讨的领域，因为他为研究人员提供了可操作性和可测试性。达尔文理论的精髓（在下一节中详细说明）既源于他在实际研究中的成功，也源于他对西方自然观存在严重误解且大多是倒退的这一广泛看法。

Darwin, as we all know, began the last chapter of the Origin with a claim that "this whole volume is one long argument" (1859, p. 459). Fine, but an argument for what? For evolution itself? In part, of course, but such a general theme cannot mark the full intent of Darwin's statement, for the bulk of the Origin moves well beyond the basic arguments for evolution's factuality, as Darwin proceeds to craft a defense for natural selection and for the philoso­phy of nature so entailed. "One long argument" for natural selection, then? Again, in part; but we now confront the obverse of my last statement: too much of the Origin details basic evidence for evolution, independent of any particular mechanism of change. Instead, we must ask what deeper subject underlies both the defense of evolution as a fact and the proposal of a mecha­nism to explain its operation? How should we characterize the "one long ar­gument" that pervades the entire book?

达尔文正如我们所知，在《物种起源》的最后一章中提到「整本书是一个完整的论证」（1859，p. 459）。那么，这究竟是在论证什么呢？是为了论证进化本身吗？部分是这样的，但达尔文的意图显然不仅限于此，因为《物种起源》的大部分内容不仅仅在于证明进化的事实，还在于为自然选择以及由此引申出的自然哲学进行辩护。那么，这是在为自然选择进行的论证吗？依然是部分如此；然而，《物种起源》中有大量内容是关于进化的基本证据，与任何具体的变化机制无关。因此，我们需要思考，是什么更深层次的主题支撑了对进化作为事实的辩护以及对其运作机制的提出？我们又该如何定义贯穿整本书的这一完整论证呢？

Ghiselin (1969) correctly identified the underlying theme as the construc­tion, and defense by example, of a methodology — a mode of practice — for testing both the fact and mechanism of evolutionary change. But I cannot agree with Ghiselin that Darwin's consistent use of "hypothetico-deductive" reasoning constitutes his long argument (see Kitcher, 1985), for this style of scientific procedure, whatever its merits or problems, has been advocated as a general methodology for all scientific activity (see Hempel, 1965). Darwin, I believe, sought to construct and defend a working method for the special sub­ject matter of evolutionary inquiry — that is, for the data of history.

Ghiselin（1969）指出，达尔文的核心主题在于建立并通过实例支持一种方法学，这种方法学是一种用于验证进化变化事实和机制的实践模式。然而，我不同意 Ghiselin 的看法，即达尔文一贯使用「假设演绎」的推理方式来构建他的长篇论证（参见 Kitcher，1985）。因为这种科学方法，无论其好坏，早已被倡导为所有科学活动的通用方法论（参见 Hempel，1965）。我认为，达尔文是在为进化研究的特定领域，即历史数据，构建和捍卫一种工作方法。

Inferences about history, so crucial to any evolutionary work, had been plagued by problems of confidence that seemed to bar any truly scientific in­quiry into the past. Darwin knew that evolution would not win respect until methods of historical inference could be established and illustrated with all the confidence of Galileo viewing the moons of Jupiter. He therefore set out to formulate rules for inference in history. I view the Origin as one long illus­tration of these rules. Historical inference sets the more general theme under­lying both the establishment of evolution as a fact, and the defense of natural selection as its mechanism. The "one long argument" of the Origin presents a comprehensive strategy and compendium of modes for historical inference (see fuller exposition of this view in Gould, 1986). We must grasp Darwin's practical campaign on this battlefield in order to understand his radical phi­losophy, and to identify the features of his theory that count as essential to any definition of "Darwinism."

对历史的推断是进化研究中的关键环节，但由于缺乏信心，科学家们一直难以对过去进行真正的科学探究。达尔文意识到，只有当历史推断的方法能够像伽利略观察木星的卫星那样被信任时，进化论才能获得尊重。因此，他开始制定历史推断的规则。我认为《物种起源》就是对这些规则的一次全面说明。历史推断不仅帮助确立了进化的事实基础，也为自然选择作为进化机制提供了支持。《物种起源》中所谓的「一场长期论证」展示了历史推断的综合策略和模式（更多内容见 Gould，1986）。理解达尔文在这方面的具体努力有助于我们领会他的激进哲学，并识别出其理论中被认为是「达尔文主义」核心的特征。

THE PROBLEM OF HISTORY

Reading Darwin has been a persisting and central joy in my intellectual life. Lyell and Huxley may have been greater prose stylists, with more consistency in the ring and power of their words. Yet I give the nod to Darwin, and not only for the greater depth and power of his ideas. Darwin often wrote quite ordinary prose, page after page. But then, frequently enough to rivet the at­tention of any careful reader, his passion bursts through, and he makes a point with such insight and force (almost always by metaphor) that under­standing breaks like sunrise. Every evolutionist can cite a list of favorite Dar­winian passages, written on well-worn index cards for lectures (or, now, eter­nally embedded in PowerPoint files), posted on the office door or prominently displayed above the typewriter (now the computer terminal), or simply (and lovingly) committed to memory.

历史的魅力阅读达尔文一直是我智识生活中持久而核心的乐趣。Lyell 和 Huxley 在散文方面或许更具风格，他们的文字一贯有力且富有韵味。然而，我对达尔文情有独钟，不仅因为他思想的深刻与强大。达尔文常常写得非常普通，一页接着一页。然而，他的激情时不时地迸发，吸引着细心读者的目光，用令人豁然开朗的隐喻表达他的观点。每位研究进化论的人都能列举出自己钟爱的达尔文段落，这些段落被珍藏在讲座用的旧索引卡片上（或现在的 PowerPoint 文件中），贴在办公室门上，或是醒目地展示在电脑上方，甚至只是用心记住，满怀热爱。

Several of my favorite passages celebrate the broadened understanding of nature that derives from recognizing organisms as products of history, rather than objects created in their present state. Darwin writes (1859, 485–486):*

我最喜欢的几个段落称颂了对自然更深入的理解，这种理解来自于把生物体看作是历史的产物，而不是只以它们现在状态存在的对象。达尔文在他的作品中写道（1859，485–486):

When we no longer look at an organic being as a savage looks at a ship, as at something wholly beyond his comprehension; when we regard every production of nature as one which has had a history; when we contemplate every complex structure and instinct as the summing up of many contrivances, each useful to the possessor, nearly in the same way as when we look at any great mechanical invention as the summing of the labor, the experience, the reason, and even the blunders of numerous workmen; when we thus view each organic being, how far more interesting, I speak from experience, will the study of natural history become!

当我们不再像原始人看待船只那样，视有机生物为无法理解的存在；当我们意识到自然界的每一件产物都有其历史；当我们看到每一个复杂的结构和本能都是许多有用设计的结晶，就像我们看待伟大的机械发明是许多工人的劳动、经验、智慧，甚至错误的汇聚时；这样看待每一个有机生物，我可以说，研究自然历史会变得更加有趣！

By contrast, Darwin's chief quarrel with creationism resides not so much in its provable falseness, but in its bankrupt status as an intellectual argument — for a claim of creation teaches us nothing at all, but only states (in words that some people may consider exalted) that a particular creature or feature exists, a fact established well enough by a simple glance: "Nothing can be more hopeless than to attempt to explain the similarity of pattern in members of the same class, by utility or by the doctrine of final causes ... On the ordinary view of the independent creation of each being, we can only say that so it is; — that it has so pleased the Creator to construct each animal and plant" (p. 435).

相比之下，达尔文与创造论的主要争论不在于它可以被证明是错误的，而在于它作为一种理论的无用 —— 创造论并没有教给我们任何东西，只是用一些听起来可能很高尚的词汇，陈述某个生物或特征的存在，而这种存在通过简单的观察就可以得到确认：「试图通过实用性或最终原因学说来解释同一类成员的相似性，这种努力是徒劳的…… 根据每个生物独立创造的观点，我们只能说这就是事实；—— 这是造物者决定如此构造每个动物和植物的意愿」（第 435 页）。

Moreover, and more negatively, creation marks the surrender of any at­tempt to understand connections and patterns. We express no causal insight whatever when we say that taxonomic order reflects the plan of a creator — for unless we can know the will of God, such a statement only stands as a re­dundant description of the order itself. (And God told us long ago, when he spoke to Job from the whirlwind, that we cannot know his will — "canst thou draw out leviathan with a hook?") Darwin, an ever genial man in the face of endless assaults upon his patience, directed several of his rare caustic com­ments against the ultimate idea stopping claim that God so made it, praise his name. Darwin notes, for example, that horses are sometimes born with faint striping on their hides. A creationist can only assert that God made each equine species of zebras, horses, and asses alike, with such tendencies to vary and thereby to display, if only occasionally, the more comprehensive type. Evolution, on the other hand, supplies a true cause for an anomaly by posit­ing community of descent with retention of ancestral states by heredity — something that might be tested in many ways, once we understand the me­chanics of inheritance. (The following passage appears just before Darwin's summary to Chapter 5 on laws of variation.) Darwin lambastes the cre­ationist alternative as causally meaningless: "To admit this view is, as it seems to me, to reject a real for an unreal, or at least for an unknown, cause. It makes the works of God a mere mockery and deception; I would almost as soon believe with the old and ignorant cosmogonists, that fossil shells had never lived, but had been created in stone so as to mock the shells now living on the sea-shore" (p. 167).

此外，更为消极的是，创造意味着我们放弃了理解事物之间联系和模式的努力。当我们说分类的秩序反映了创造者的意图时，这其实没有提供任何因果的见解 —— 因为除非我们能了解上帝的意图，否则这样的说法只是重复了秩序本身。（而且，上帝早在旋风中对约伯讲话时就告诉我们，我们无法知道他的意图 ——「你能用钩子把鳄鱼钓上来吗？」）达尔文，这位始终温和地面对各种考验的人，曾对那种认为「上帝如此创造，赞美他的名字」的想法提出了少有的尖锐批评。达尔文指出，马有时出生时皮毛上会出现淡淡的条纹。创造论者可能会声称，上帝创造了斑马、马和驴等物种，并赋予它们变异的倾向，从而偶尔展示出更广泛的类型。相比之下，进化论通过提出共同的祖先和遗传保留祖先特征的观点，为这些异常现象提供了合理的解释 —— 一旦我们理解了遗传机制，就可以通过多种方法进行验证。（以下内容出现在达尔文关于变异法则的第五章总结之前。）达尔文批评创造论的替代方案，认为其在因果解释上毫无意义：「在我看来，接受这个观点就是拒绝真实的原因而采纳虚幻或未知的原因。这使得上帝的作品成为一种嘲弄和欺骗；我几乎宁愿相信那些古老无知的宇宙学家，认为化石贝壳从未活过，而是被创造在石头中，以嘲弄现在海岸上的贝壳。」（第 167 页）

If we must locate our confidence about evolution in evidence for history — in part directly from the fossil record, but usually indirectly by inference from modern organisms — by what rules of reason, or canons of evidence, shall his­tory then be established? Darwin's "long argument," in my view, can best be characterized as a complex solution to this question, illustrated with copious examples. We must first, however, specify the kinds of questions that can­not be answered. Many revealing statements in the Origin circumscribe the proper realm of historical inference by abjuring what cannot be known, or usefully comprehended under current limits. Darwin, for example, and fol­lowing Hutton, Lyell and many other great thinkers, foreswore (as beyond the realm of science) all inquiry into the ultimate origins of things.* In the first paragraph of Chapter 7 on instincts, for example, Darwin writes (1859, p. 207): "I must premise, that I have nothing to do with the origin of the pri­mary mental powers, any more than I have with that of life itself." Darwin in­voked the same comparison in discussing the evolution of eyes, one of his greatest challenges (and firmest successes). He states that he will confine his attention to transitions in a structural sequence from simple to complex, and not engage the prior issue — answerable in principle, but beyond the range of knowledge in his day — of how sensitivity to light could arise within nervous tissue in the first place (1859, p. 187): "How a nerve comes to be sensitive to light, hardly concerns us more than how life itself first originated." Most crucially, and in a savvy argument that saved his entire system in the face of con­temporary ignorance on a central issue, Darwin argues over and over again that we may bypass the vital question of how heredity works, and how varia­tions arise — and only illustrate how evolution can occur, given the commonplace observation that sufficient variation does exist, and is inherited often enough:

如果我们必须在历史证据中找到对进化的信心 —— 部分直接来自化石记录，但通常通过现代生物推断间接获得 —— 那么，应该遵循什么样的推理规则或证据标准来确立历史呢？在我看来，达尔文的「长篇论证」可以被看作是对此问题的复杂解答，并通过丰富的例子进行说明。然而，我们首先必须明确哪些问题是无法回答的。《物种起源》中有许多发人深省的陈述，通过放弃那些在当前条件下无法理解或意义不大的问题，划定了历史推断的正确领域。比如，达尔文沿袭了休顿、莱尔和其他许多伟大思想家的思路，认为关于事物最终起源的问题是超出科学范畴的。在第七章讨论本能的第一段中，达尔文写道（1859 年，页 207）：「我必须说明，我对基本心理能力的起源没有研究兴趣，就像我对生命本身的起源没有兴趣一样。」在探讨眼睛的进化时，达尔文也提出了类似的观点，这是他面临的最大挑战之一，也是最显著的成功之一。他表示，他将专注于从简单到复杂的结构演变，而不涉及在他那个时代尚未解决的问题 —— 即神经组织如何首先对光产生敏感（1859 年，页 187）：「神经如何对光敏感，与生命本身如何最初起源几乎无关。」最重要的是，在一个聪明的论证中，达尔文不断强调，我们可以避开关于遗传机制和变异来源的核心问题 —— 只要我们能够展示进化如何发生，因为我们普遍观察到足够的变异确实存在，并且经常被遗传。

Whatever the cause may be of each slight difference in the offspring from their parents — and a cause for each must exist — it is the steady accumu­lation, through natural selection, of such differences, when beneficial to the individual, that gives rise to all the more important modifications of structure, by which the innumerable beings on the face of this earth are enabled to struggle with each other, and the best adapted to sur­vive (p. 170 — see also p. 131 for Darwin's argument that when we as­cribe variation to "chance," we only mean to express our ignorance of causes).

无论后代与父母之间细微差异的原因是什么 —— 这些差异必然有其原因 —— 通过自然选择，这些差异如果对个体有利，就会逐渐积累，从而导致结构上更重要的改变。正是这些改变，使得地球上的无数生物能够相互竞争，适者生存（第 170 页 —— 在第 131 页，达尔文论述了，当我们将变异归因于「偶然」时，其实只是表示我们对原因的无知）。

Having established a domain of testability by exclusion, Darwin laid out his methodology for history — never explicitly to be sure, but with such accu­mulating force by example that the entire book becomes "one long argu­ment" for the tractability of his new science. Those of us who practice the sci­ences of reconstructing specific events and unravelling temporal sequences have always fought a battle for appropriate status and respect, no less so to­day than in Darwin's time (see Gould, 1986), against those who would view such work as a "lesser" activity, or not part of science at all. History presents two special problems: (1) frequent absence of evidence, given imperfections of preservation; and (2) uniqueness of sequences, unrepeatable in their con­tingent complexity, and thereby distancing the data of history from such stan­dard concepts as prediction, and experimentation.

Darwin 在通过排除法建立了一个可测试的领域后，阐述了他的历史研究方法 —— 虽然从未明确说明，但通过不断累积的实例，整本书成为了他新科学可操作性的「长篇论证」。我们这些从事重建特定事件和解开时间序列的科学家们，一直在为获得应有的地位和尊重而奋斗，今天也不例外，这种情况和 Darwin 时代并无二致（参见 Gould，1986）。我们常常面临一些人的质疑，他们认为这项工作是「次等」的活动，甚至不属于科学范畴。历史研究面临两个特殊问题：（1）由于保存条件的不完善，证据常常缺失；（2）序列具有独特性，其伴随的复杂性无法重复，这使得历史数据与预测和实验等标准科学概念相去甚远。

We may epitomize the dilemma in the following way: many people define science as the study of causal processes. Past processes are, in principle, unobservable. We must therefore work by inference from results preserved in the historical record. We must study modern results produced by processes that can be directly observed and even manipulated by experiment — and we must then infer the causes of past results by their "sufficient similarity" (Steno's principle — see Gould, 1981c) with present results. This procedure re­quires, as Mill (1881) and other philosophers recognized long ago, a method­ological assumption of temporal invariance for laws of nature. Historical study manifests its special character by placing primary emphasis upon com­parison and degrees of similarity, rather than the canonical methods of sim­plification, manipulation, controlled experiment, and prediction.

我们可以这样看待这个问题：很多人认为科学是研究因果过程。然而，过去的过程本质上是无法直接观察的。因此，我们需要根据历史记录中保存的结果进行推断。我们要研究那些通过能直接观察或实验操控的过程所产生的现代结果 —— 然后，我们通过这些结果与现今结果「足够相似」（Steno 的原则 —— 参见 Gould，1981c）来推断过去结果的原因。正如 Mill（1881）和其他哲学家早已指出的，这一过程需要方法论上假设自然规律在时间上的不变性。历史研究的独特性在于，它主要强调比较和相似度，而不是依赖简化、操控、控制实验和预测的传统方法。

Darwin had done some paleontological work, particularly in his treatises on barnacles (1851-1858), and his important discoveries of South American fossil vertebrates (formally named and described by Owen, at Darwin's invi­tation). But Darwin was not primarily a paleontologist, and he did not intend to base his argument for evolution on the evidence of fossils — especially since he viewed the stratigraphic record, with its vast preponderance of gaps over evidence, as more a hindrance than an aid to his theory (see chapters 9 and 10 of the Origin). Thus, of the two major sources for historical reconstruction — direct but imperfect information from fossils, and indirect but copious data from modern organisms — Darwin preferred the second as his wellspring of documentation. The Origin therefore focuses upon the establishment of a methodology for making inferences about history from features of modern organisms — and then using these multifarious inferences to prove both the fact of evolution and the probability of natural selection as a primary mecha­nism of change.

达尔文曾从事一些古生物学研究，尤其是在他关于藤壶的论文（1851-1858）中，以及他发现南美化石脊椎动物的重要工作（由欧文在达尔文的邀请下正式命名和描述）。然而，达尔文并非主要从事古生物学，他也不打算把进化论的论据建立在化石证据上，因为他认为地层记录中存在的众多空白更多是对他的理论的障碍，而非支持（参见《物种起源》第 9 和第 10 章）。因此，在重建历史的两大信息源中 —— 直接但不完美的化石信息和间接但丰富的现代生物数据 —— 达尔文更倾向于利用现代生物的数据。因此，《物种起源》重点在于建立一种方法，通过现代生物的特征推断历史，并利用这些多种推断来证明进化的事实和自然选择作为主要变化机制的可能性。

A FOURFOLD CONTINUUM OF METHODS FOR THE INFERENCE OF HISTORY

Darwin, as a subtle and brilliant thinker, must be read on several levels. Con­sider just three, at decreasing domains of overt display, but increasing realms of generality: On the surface — a lovely, and not a pejorative, location for any student of nature — each book treats a particular puzzle: different forms of flowers on the same plant (1877), modes of formation for coral atolls (1842), formation of soil by worms (1881), styles of movement in climbing plants (1880a), the fertilization of orchids by insects (1862). At an intermediary level, as Ghiselin (1969) showed in his innovative study of the entire Darwin­ian corpus, each book forms part of a comprehensive argument for evolution itself. But I believe that we must also recognize a third, even deeper and more comprehensive layer of coordinating generality — Darwin's struggle to con­struct and apply a workable method for historical inference: a series of proce­dures offering sufficient confidence to place the sciences of history on a par with the finest experimental work in physics and chemistry. I have come to re­gard each of Darwin's books as, all at the same time, a treatment of a particu­lar puzzle (level one), an argument for an evolutionary worldview (level two), and a treatise on historical methodology (level three). But the methodological focus of level three has usually been overlooked because Darwin chose to work by practice rather than proclamation.

达尔文是一位敏锐而杰出的思想家，我们可以从三个层次来理解他的作品。首先，在表面层次上 —— 这是一个对自然研究者来说非常美妙的领域 —— 他的每本书都探讨一个独特的问题：同一植物上不同形式的花（1877）、珊瑚环礁的形成方式（1842）、蚯蚓形成土壤（1881）、攀缘植物的运动方式（1880a）、昆虫授粉兰花（1862）。其次，在中间层次上，如 Ghiselin（1969）在他的研究中所揭示的，每本书都是对进化论的全面支持。然而，我认为我们还需要关注第三个更深层次的内容：达尔文努力构建并应用一种行之有效的历史推理方法。这种方法提供了足够的信心，使历史科学能够与物理和化学中的顶级实验工作相媲美。我开始认为达尔文的每本书同时是对一个独特问题的探讨（第一个层次）、对进化世界观的支持（第二个层次）、以及关于历史方法论的论述（第三个层次）。然而，由于达尔文选择通过实践而非宣言来表达，第三级的方法论重点通常被忽视。

Darwin recognized that several methods of historical inference must be developed, each tailored to the nature and quality of available evidence. We may order his procedures by decreasing density of available information. I recognize four waystations in the continuum and argue that each finds a pri­mary illustration in one of Darwin's books on a specific puzzle in natural his­tory. The Origin of Species, as his comprehensive view of nature, uses all four methods, and may therefore be read as a summation of his seminal contribu­tion to the methodology of historical science. I shall list, and then illustrate with examples from the Origin, these four principles ordered by decreasing density of information.

达尔文认识到需要发展多种历史推断方法，每种方法都需要根据可用证据的性质和质量量身定制。我们可以按照信息从最丰富到最稀疏的顺序来排列他的这些方法。我识别出四个阶段，并认为每个阶段都在达尔文的一本专注于自然历史中特定问题的书中得到了主要的例证。作为他对自然的全面理解，《物种起源》使用了所有四种方法，因此可以被视为他对历史科学方法论的开创性贡献的总结。我将按信息密度的递减顺序列出这四个原则，并用《物种起源》中的例子进行说明。

Uniformity. Or working up by extrapolation from direct observations on rates and modes of change in modern organisms. Call this, if you will, the worm principle to honor Darwin's last book (1881), which explains the topsoil and topography of England by extrapolating the measured work of worms through all scales of time, from the weight of castings left daily on a patch of sod to the historical and geological realms of millennia to millions of years.

均一性。或者可以称之为从现代理论推断出的变化法则。这种方法可以被称为「蠕虫原则」，以纪念达尔文在 1881 年出版的最后一本书。这本书通过推断蠕虫在各个时间尺度上的工作，解释了英国的表层土壤和地形。从每天草地上蠕虫留下的铸件重量，到跨越千年甚至数百万年的历史和地质变化，都是这种方法的体现。

Sequencing. Or the definition and ordering of various configurations, previously regarded as unrelated and independent, into stages of a single his­torical process. Here we cannot observe the changes between configurations directly and we must therefore work by recognizing them as temporally or­dered products of a single underlying process of change. Call this, if you will, the coral reef principle to honor Darwin's first book (1842) on a scientific subject. His successful theory proposes a single historical process for the for­mation of coral atolls by recognizing three configurations of reefs — fringing reefs, barrier reefs, and atolls — as sequential stages in the foundering of oce­anic islands.

排序。即将以前被认为不相关和独立的各种配置，按照时间顺序排列成一个单一的历史过程的各个阶段。在这里，我们无法直接观察各个配置之间的变化，因此需要通过识别这些配置作为一个基本变化过程的时间顺序产物来进行研究。为了纪念达尔文在 1842 年撰写的第一本科学著作，我们可以称之为珊瑚礁原则。他成功的理论提出了珊瑚环礁形成的一个单一历史过程，通过将岸礁、堡礁和环礁三种珊瑚礁的配置识别为海洋岛屿沉没过程中的连续阶段。

Consilience (concordance of several). We now reach a break in types of information. Methods 1 and 2 permit the reconstruction of histor­ical sequences, either by extrapolating up from the most palpable and testable of daily changes (method 1), or by ordering a series of configurations as tem­poral stages (method 2). In many cases, however, we cannot reconstruct se­quences, and must infer history from the configuration of a single object or circumstance. Of the two major methods for inferring history from single configurations, consilience calls upon a greater range of evidence. This word, coined by William Whewell in 1840, means "jumping together." By this term, Whewell referred to proof by coordination of so many otherwise unrelated consequences under a single causal explanation that no other organization of data seems conceivable. In a sense, consilience defines the larger method un­derlying all Darwin's inference from historical records. In a more specific con­text, I use consilience (see Gould, 1986) for Darwin's principal tactic of bring­ing so many different points of evidence to bear on a single subject, that history wins assent as an explanation by overwhelming confirmation and unique coordination. Call this, if you will, the different flowers principle to honor the extraordinary range of evidence that Darwin gathered (1877) to forge a historical explanation for why some taxa bear different forms of flowers on the same plant.

融贯（将不同信息的协调统一）。我们现在讨论信息类型的划分。方法 1 和方法 2 可以重建历史序列：方法 1 是通过推断日常变化中最明显和可验证的部分；而方法 2 是将一系列配置排列成时间阶段。然而，在许多情况下，我们无法重建序列，只能从单一对象或情况的配置中推断历史。在通过单一配置推断历史的两种主要方法中，融贯使用了更为广泛的证据。这个词由 William Whewell 在 1840 年创造，意指「共同跳跃」。Whewell 用这个术语来描述一种通过在单一因果解释下协调多个看似无关的结果，以至于无法想象其他数据组织方式的证明方法。从某种意义上说，融贯定义了达尔文从历史记录中推断的所有方法的核心。在更具体的情境下，我使用融贯（参见 Gould，1986）来描述达尔文的主要策略：他将众多不同的证据集中于一个主题，使得历史作为解释因其压倒性的确认和独特的协调性而被认可。如果你愿意，可以称之为「不同花朵原则」，以纪念达尔文（1877）为解释为何某些类群在同一植物上有不同形式的花而收集的广泛证据。

Discordance (dissonance of one). Here we reach a rock bottom of minimalism — unfortunately all too common in a world of limited informa­tion. We observe a single object, but not enough relevant items to forge consilience about its status as the product of history. How can we work from unique objects? How shall we infer history from a giraffe? Darwin tells us to search for a particular form of discordance — some imperfection or fail­ure of coordination between an organism and its current circumstances. If such a quirk, oddity, or imperfection — making no sense as an optimal and immutable design in a current context — wins explanation as a holdover or vestige from a past state in different circumstances, then historical change may be inferred. Call this, if you will, the orchid principle (though I have also designated it as the panda principle for my own favorite example, perforce unknown to Darwin, of the panda's false thumb, Gould, 1980d), to honor Darwin's argument (1862) for orchids as products of history. Their intricate adaptations to attract insects for fertilization cannot be read as wonders of optimal design, specially created for current utilities, for they represent con­traptions, jury-rigged from the available parts of ordinary flowers.

不和谐（单一物体的失调）。在这里，我们达到了极简主义的极致 —— 在信息匮乏的世界中，这种情况不幸地太常见了。我们观察到一个单一的对象，但缺乏足够的相关信息来确认它作为历史产物的地位。我们该如何从独特的对象中得出结论？我们能从一只长颈鹿中推断出历史吗？达尔文建议我们寻找一种特定形式的不和谐 —— 也就是生物体与其当前环境之间的不完美或不协调之处。如果这种怪异、不寻常或缺陷在当前情境中无法解释为一种完美且不可改变的设计，而是作为过去不同环境下的遗留或残余，那么我们可以推断出历史的变化。你可以称之为兰花原则（尽管我更喜欢称其为熊猫原则，因为我喜欢的例子 —— 熊猫的假拇指 —— 是达尔文所不知道的，Gould，1980d），以此致敬达尔文（1862）关于兰花是历史产物的观点。它们复杂的适应性用来吸引昆虫授粉，不能简单地看作是为当前用途特别创造的完美设计，因为这些复杂结构是用普通花的部分临时拼凑而成的。

The Origin of Species presents an ingenious compendium of all four methods.

UNIFORMITY. People who do not understand science in their bones, and who think that revolutionary treatises must be presented as ideological mani­festos at broadest scale, often express surprise and disappointment in reading the Origin, especially at Darwin's opening chapter. They expect fanfare, and they get fantails — pigeons, that is. But Darwin ordered his book by conscious intent and strategy. He knew that he had to demonstrate evolution with data, not simply proclaim his new view of life by rhetoric. Uniformitarianism em­bodied his best method based on maximal information — so he started from the smallest scale, change in domestication, and worked up to the history of life. As a member of two London pigeon fancying clubs (which he had joined, not from an abiding affection for this scourge of cities, but to gain practical information about evolution in the small), Darwin led from his acquired strength.

《物种起源》巧妙地综合了四种方法。

一致性。那些对科学不够深入了解，并认为革命性论文应该以广泛的意识形态宣言形式出现的人，在阅读《物种起源》时，尤其是在达尔文的第一章时，常常感到惊讶和失望。他们期待的是轰动的场面，但得到的却是鸽子 —— 而不是盛大的开场。但达尔文有意且策略性地安排了他的书。他知道必须通过数据来证明进化，而不仅仅是用辞藻来宣扬他的新生命观。均变论（Uniformitarianism）是他基于最大信息量的最佳方法，所以他从最小的研究对象入手，即驯化中的变化，并逐渐扩展到整个生命的历史。作为两个伦敦鸽子爱好俱乐部的成员（他加入这些俱乐部并不是因为对鸽子这种城市常见生物的热爱，而是为了获得有关微观进化的实际信息），达尔文从他已掌握的领域出发。

What better starting point, under method 1, than indubitable proof of historical change in domesticated plants and animals. The logic of the Origin employs one long analogy between artificial and natural selection, with uni­formity as the joining point. Darwin writes in his introduction (p. 4): "At the commencement of my observations it seemed to me probable that a careful study of domesticated animals and of cultivated plants would offer the best chance of making out this obscure problem. Nor have I been disappointed; in this and in all other perplexing cases I have invariably found that our knowl­edge, imperfect though it be, of variation under domestication, afforded the best and safest clue."

在方法 1 的情况下，驯化植物和动物历史变化的确凿证据是一个很好的起点。《物种起源》的逻辑利用了人工选择和自然选择之间的长时间类比，以一致性作为连接点。达尔文在他的介绍中写道（第 4 页）：「在我开始观察时，我认为仔细研究驯化动物和栽培植物可能是解决这个模糊问题的最佳方法。而我的确没有感到失望；在这个和所有其他令人困惑的情况下，我总是发现，尽管我们对驯化条件下的变异的了解并不完善，但它提供了最可靠和安全的线索。」

Darwin continually drives home this analogy and extrapolation: if by arti­ficial selection at small scale (as we know for certain), why not by natural se­lection at larger scale: "If it profit a plant to have its seeds more and more widely disseminated by the wind, I can see no greater difficulty in this being effected through natural selection, than in the cotton-planter increasing and improving by selection the down in the pods on his cotton-trees" (p. 86).

达尔文不断地提出这样的类比和推论：如果在小范围内可以通过人工选择实现某些结果（这是我们明确知道的），那么为什么不能在更大范围内通过自然选择实现呢？他说：「如果植物的种子能够通过风更广泛地传播对它有好处，那么我认为通过自然选择来实现这一点没有比棉花种植者通过选择来增加和改良棉荚中的绒毛更困难」(第 86 页）。

But this argument by uniformitarian extrapolation presents a serious dif­ficulty (exploited by Fleeming Jenkin, 1867, in the famous critique that Dar­win ranked so highly, and took so seriously in revising the Origin): change surely occurs in domestication, but suppose that species function like glass spheres with a modal configuration at the center and unbridgeable limits to variation representing the surface. Artificial selection could then bring mor­phology from the center to the surface, but no further — and the key argument for smooth extrapolation to all change over any time would fail. Darwin therefore staked a verbal claim for no limit. "What limit can be put to this power, acting during long ages and rigidly scrutinizing the whole constitu­tion, structure, and habits of each creature — favoring the good and rejecting the bad? I can see no limit to this power, in slowly and beautifully adapting each form to the most complex relations of life" (p. 469).

然而，通过均变论的外推来支持这一观点存在严重问题。Fleeming Jenkin 在 1867 年的著名批评中就曾利用这一点，达尔文对此非常重视，并在修改《物种起源》时仔细考虑。变化确实在驯化过程中发生，但假如物种就像玻璃球一样：中心有一个模式，而表面代表无法逾越的变异界限。人工选择可以将物种的形态从中心推到表面，但无法超越这个界限 —— 因此，所有变化在任何时间上的平滑外推的关键论点就会失效。达尔文因此主张这种变化是没有限制的。他说：「这种力量在漫长的年代中发挥作用，仔细审视每种生物的整体结构和习性 —— 保留优良的，淘汰不良的，我看不出这种力量在缓慢而优雅地适应生活中最复杂关系时有什么限制」（第 469 页）。

Darwin then applied the full sequence of extrapolation to the natural world, beginning with individual variants as the source of subspecies, then moving to subspecies as incipient species, and finally to species as potential ancestors for branches of life's tree — a full range of scales from variation within a population to the entire pageant of life: "I look at individual differ­ences, though of small interest to the systematist, as of high importance for us, as being the first step towards such slight varieties as are barely thought worth recording in works of natural history. And as I look at varieties which are in any degree more distinct and permanent, as steps leading to more strongly marked and more permanent varieties; and at these latter, as leading to subspecies, and to species" (p. 51).

达尔文随后将整个外推过程应用于自然界，首先从个体变体开始，视其为亚种的来源，然后将亚种看作是初期物种，最终将物种视为生命树分支的潜在祖先 —— 这一过程涵盖了从群体内的变异到整个生命全景的不同尺度：「我认为个体差异虽然对系统学家来说可能兴趣不大，但对我们非常重要，因为这是朝向那些在自然历史中几乎不值得记录的小变种的第一步。我把任何程度上更为明显和持久的变种视为通向更明显和持久的变种的步骤；而这些变种则是通向亚种和物种的途径」（第 51 页）。

Darwin invoked this first method, a strong argument based on maximal information at smallest scale, as his favored choice when available. To cite just three instances as a sampler: (1) the paleontological panorama may be read as a story of gradual evolution because species in adjacent strata show minimal differences, but these differences increase gradually as stratigraphic distance expands (p. 335). (2) When we find hints of the feather patterns of rock pi­geon in highly modified breeds, we do not hesitate to interpret these designs as vestiges of an ancestral stock; therefore, the faint stripes that we sometimes observe in coats of young horses point to a common origin for all species in the clade of horses, asses and zebras (pp. 166–167). (3) Marine molluscs of­ten exhibit brighter colors in warmer waters. We note this pattern both among varieties of a single species living in cold and warm waters, and among related species. A creationist explanation requires uncomfortable spe­cial pleading: God sometimes makes a species with bright shells in warm cli­mates, but he allows other species to vary naturally, in the same geographic pattern, within a single created kind. An evolutionist, using method one, will recognize these phenomena as two stages in a single sequence of extrapola­tion from smaller to larger scale (p. 133).

达尔文采用了这种方法，即在最小规模上获取最大信息的有力论证，作为他在条件允许时的首选。以下以三个实例为例：（1）化石记录可以被解读为逐步演化的过程，因为相邻地层中的物种差异很小，但随着地层距离的增加，这些差异会逐渐增大（第 335 页）。（2）当我们在高度改良的品种中发现岩鸽羽毛图案的痕迹时，我们很自然地将这些设计视为祖先的遗留；因此，我们有时在幼马的毛皮上观察到的微弱条纹，指向马、驴和斑马所有物种的共同祖先（第 166-167 页）。（3）海洋软体动物在温暖水域中常常表现出更鲜艳的颜色。我们注意到这一模式存在于同一物种的冷水和温水变种之间，以及在相关物种之间。创世论需要特殊的解释：上帝有时在温暖气候中创造出鲜艳的贝壳，而在同一地理模式中，其他物种则自然变化。进化论者使用第一种方法，会将这些现象视为从小到大单一序列中的两个阶段（第 133 页）。

SEQUENCING. We can use a second style of inference about temporal order when we cannot obtain adequate data about the nature of immediate changes at smallest scale. Since historical processes begin at different times and pro­ceed at varying rates, all stages of a sequence may exist simultaneously (for example, stage one in case A, which began very recently; stage two in case B, which began at the same time, but has proceeded at an uncommonly rapid rate; and stage three in case C, which began long ago). Thus, fringing reefs, barrier reefs and atolls all exist now. When we recognize these forms as se­quential stages of a single process, we may infer the pathway of history.

时间顺序推理。当我们无法获得有关微观层面即时变化的充分数据时，可以采用另一种时间顺序推理的方法。由于历史过程的开始时间不同且进展速度各异，序列中的各个阶段可能同时存在（例如：案例 A 中的第一阶段刚刚开始；案例 B 的第二阶段虽然与案例 A 同时开始，但进展异常迅速；案例 C 的第三阶段则开始于很久以前）。因此，边缘礁、堡礁和环礁现在都可以同时存在。当我们将这些地貌形式视为同一过程的连续阶段时，我们便可以推断出历史发展的路径。

Darwin epitomizes method two in writing (p. 51): "A series impresses the mind with the idea of an actual passage." Invoking his usual starting point, Darwin presents a first example from breeds of domesticated pigeons. The more adequate data of method one — observed steps of passage, accumulating to greater and greater difference in time — no longer exist, for the transitional populations have died, and only a set of morphological "islands," represent­ing a set of established breeds, remains. But these islands can be ordered as a plausible sequence of change between ancestral rock pigeons and the most aberrant of artificially produced breeds: "Although an English carrier or short-faced tumbler differs immensely in certain characters from the rock pi­geon, yet by comparing the several sub-breeds of these breeds, more espe­cially those brought from distant countries, we can make an almost perfect series between the extremes of structure" (p. 27).

达尔文在写作中展示了第二种方法（第 51 页）：「一系列让人感受到实际变迁的印象。」他从他惯常的起点出发，首先举了家养鸽子品种的例子。第一种方法所需的更详尽的数据，即观察到的一步步变化，逐渐积累形成更大的时间差异，已经无法获取，因为这些过渡种群已经灭绝，只剩下代表不同品种的一组形态「孤岛」。然而，这些「孤岛」可以排列成一个合理的演变序列，从祖先的岩鸽到人工培育的最独特品种：「尽管英国信鸽或短脸翻滚鸽在某些特征上与岩鸽差异巨大，但通过比较这些品种的几个亚种，特别是从远方国家带来的那些，我们几乎可以在结构的两个极端之间形成一个完美的系列」（第 27 页）。

Darwin uses method two in a special and crucial way throughout the Ori­gin. Several of the most telling critiques against Darwin's style of evolution by gradualistic continuity — best represented in Mivart's famous argument (1871) about inviability of "incipient stages of useful structures" (see Chap­ter 11 for full treatment) — held that insensibly graded passages between puta­tive ancestors and descendants could not even be conceptualized, much less documented. Charges of inconceivability took several forms, each reducible to the claim that you can't get from here to there, however well the beginning and end points may function. Consider the two most prominent formula­tions: (1) Early stages (when rudimentary) could provide no adaptive advan­tage, however valuable the final product (2) Major functional changes cannot occur because intermediary stages would fall into a never-never land of invia­bility, with the original (and essential) function lost, and the new operation not yet established.

达尔文在《物种起源》中采用了一种特殊且关键的方法来进行论述。针对达尔文渐进连续性进化理论的批评中，最具代表性的是 Mivart 在 1871 年提出的有关「有用结构的初始阶段」无法存活的论点（详见第 11 章）。这些批评认为，从假设的祖先到后代的渐进过渡不仅难以想象，更难以记录。这些质疑主要集中在两个方面：(1）早期阶段（即使是初级阶段）无法提供适应性优势，即便最终产品很有价值；(2）主要功能无法改变，因为中间阶段可能会失去原本必需的功能，而新功能尚未确立，导致无法存活的发展困境。

Darwin offered a twofold response to these arguments, both using this sec­ond historical method of sequencing. He first presented theoretical arguments for the conceivability, even the likelihood, of intermediary stages in supposed cases of impossibility. He argued that early stages, too small to work in their eventual manner, could have performed different functions at the outset, and been coopted later for another style of life. (Incipient wings, originally used in thermoregulation, became organs of flight when they evolved to sufficiently large size to provide "fortuitous" aerodynamic benefits — see Kingsolver and Koehl, 1985, for an experimental validation of this scenario, and Gould, 1991b, for general discussion). As the misleadingly named principle of "pre-adaptation," this concept of functional shift became an important principle in evolutionary theory (see Chapter 11). Darwin writes, using a verbal intensifier rarely found in his prose: "In considering transitions of organs, it is so important to bear in mind the probability of conversion from one function to another" (p. 191).

达尔文针对这些论点作出了两方面的回应，都是通过第二种历史排序方法。他首先提出理论论据，指出在所谓不可能的情况下，中间阶段是可以设想的，甚至是可能的。他认为，早期阶段虽然规模较小，无法以最终的方式运作，但可以在最初承担不同的功能，随后被应用于另一种生活方式。（例如，初期的翅膀最初用于热量调节，随着进化到足够大的尺寸而提供了「偶然」的空气动力学优势，最终成为飞行器官 —— 有关这种情景的实验验证，请参阅 Kingsolver 和 Koehl，1985 年，以及一般讨论请参阅 Gould，1991b）。这种功能转变的概念被称为「预适应」原则，尽管这一名称可能造成误解，但它已成为进化理论中的一个重要原则（见第 11 章）。达尔文在写作中使用了一种其文章中少见的强调语气：「在考虑器官的过渡时，牢记从一个功能到另一个功能转换的可能性是极其重要的」（第 191 页）。

As a response to charges of inviability for intermediary stages, Darwin invoked the important principle of redundancy as a norm for organic structures and functions. Most important functions can be performed by more than one organ; and most organs work in more than one way. By coupling these two aspects of redundancy, transitions in single organs can easily be conceived. An organ doesn't mysteriously invent a new function, but usually intensifies and specializes a previously minor use, while shedding an old primary opera­tion. This previously major function can then be lost because other organs continue to do the same necessary job.

为了回应关于中间阶段不可行的指控，达尔文提出了冗余这一重要原则，并认为这是有机结构和功能的常态。大多数重要功能可以由多个器官来执行，而大多数器官可以通过多种方式来工作。结合冗余的这两个方面，我们可以很容易地设想单个器官的过渡过程。器官不会突然产生一种新功能，而是通常会强化和专门化之前不太重要的用途，同时放弃旧的主要功能。这个之前的主要功能因此可以消失，因为其他器官仍在继续执行同样必要的任务。

Ironically, we now recognize Darwin's favorite example of such redun­dancy as not only incorrect, but truly backwards (Gould, 1989b) — the evolu­tion of lungs from swimbladders. (In fact, swimbladders evolved from lungs, see Liem, 1988). Darwin ran his transition in the wrong way, but his argu­ment for redundancy as the key to viability for intermediary steps remains correct and crucially important, for the logic works equally well in either direction. Ancestral fishes maintained two systems for breathing — gills and lungs (as do modern lungfish, taxonomically called Dipnoi, or "two breath­ing"). The original lung probably played a subsidiary role in buoyancy; this function could be enhanced, and the original use in breathing deleted, be­cause gills could adopt the entire respiratory burden. Darwin wrote (pp. 204–205): "For instance, a swim bladder has apparently been converted into an air-breathing lung. The same organ having performed simultaneously very different functions, and then having been specialized for one function; and two very distinct organs having performed at the same time the same func­tion, the one having been perfected whilst aided by the other, must often have largely facilitated transitions."

讽刺的是，我们现在认识到达尔文最喜欢的冗余例子不仅是错误的，而且完全颠倒了（Gould，1989b）—— 他认为肺是从鱼鳔进化而来的。实际上，鱼鳔是由肺进化而来的（参见 Liem，1988）。达尔文在这个演变过程中走错了方向，但他关于冗余作为中间步骤生存能力关键的论点仍然是正确且非常重要的，因为这一逻辑在任何方向上都同样适用。祖先鱼类保留了两种呼吸系统 —— 鳃和肺（现代的肺鱼也是如此，分类上称为双呼吸鱼，意为「两个呼吸」）。原始的肺可能在浮力方面起了次要作用；这个功能可以得到增强，而原本用于呼吸的功能则可以被鳃完全取代。达尔文写道（第 204-205 页）：「例如，鱼鳔显然已经转变为一个用于空气呼吸的肺。同一个器官同时执行了非常不同的功能，然后专门化为一种功能；两个截然不同的器官同时执行相同的功能，一个在另一个的帮助下逐步完善，这在很大程度上促进了转变。」

As a second response, Darwin proceeded beyond conceivability and tried to document actual sequences for supposedly impossible transitions — as in the evolution of a light-sensitive spot into an "organ of extreme perfection" like the vertebrate eye. These sequences cannot represent true phylogenies (since they consist solely of living species), but they do constitute structural series illustrating the conceivability of transitions. After admitting, for exam­ple, that the gradual evolution of such a miracle of workmanship as the eye "seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest possible degree" (p. 186), Dar­win presents a structural series of disparate animals, including working con­figurations proclaimed impossible by opponents: "Yet reason tells me, that if numerous gradations from a perfect and complex eye to one very imperfect and simple, each grade being useful to its possessor, can be shown to exist... then the difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection, though insuperable by our imagination, can hardly be considered real" (p. 186).

作为第二种回应，达尔文超越了人们的想象能力，尝试记录那些被认为不可能的进化转换的实际过程 —— 例如，将一个光敏点进化为像脊椎动物眼睛这样极其完美的器官。这些序列无法代表真实的系统演化过程（因为它们仅由现存的物种组成），但它们确实构成了一系列结构，展示了这种转换是可以想象的。例如，在承认像眼睛这样被认为是工艺奇迹的器官的逐步进化「我坦率地承认，似乎在最高程度上荒谬」（第 186 页）之后，达尔文展示了一系列不相关动物的结构，包括被反对者宣称为不可能的工作配置：「然而，理性告诉我，如果从一个完美和复杂的眼睛到一个非常不完美和简单的眼睛的众多渐变，每个等级对其拥有者都有用，可以被证明存在…… 那么相信一个完美和复杂的眼睛可以通过自然选择形成的困难，虽然我们的想象力无法克服，但几乎不能被认为是真实的」（第 186 页）。

Darwin applies this principle to behavior and its products, as well as to form. For the exquisite mathematical regularity of the honeycomb, he writes (p. 225): "Let us look to the great principle of gradation, and see whether Na­ture does not reveal to us her method of work." (See also page 210 on com­plex instincts and their explanation by the establishment of structural series.)

达尔文不仅将这一原理应用于生物形态，也应用于行为及其结果。对于蜂巢的精美数学规律性，他写道：「让我们关注等级的原则，看看自然界是否向我们展示了她的工作方式。」（详见第 210 页，关于复杂本能及其通过结构序列进行解释的内容。）

CONSILIENCE (CONCORDANCE OF SEVERAL). Darwin took great pride in his formulation of natural selection as a theory for the mechanism of phyletic change. But he granted even more importance to his relentless pre­sentation of dense documentation for the factuality of change — for only such a cascade of data would force the scientific world to take evolution seriously. (The contrast between the Origin as a compendium of facts, and Lamarck's Philosophie zoologique as a purely theoretical treatise, strikes me as an even more distinguishing difference than the disparate causal mechanisms pro­posed by the two authors.) Facts literally pour from almost every page of the Origin, a feature that became even more apparent following Darwin's forced change of plans, and his decision to compress his projected longer work into the "abstract" that we call the Origin of Species — a revised strategy that led him to omit almost every reference and footnote, and almost all discursive discussion between bits of information. In some parts, the Origin reaches an almost frenetic pace in its cascading of facts, one upon the other. Only Dar­win's meticulous sense of order and logic of argument save the work from dis­abling elision and overload.

（多个方面的一致性）达尔文非常自豪地将自然选择作为物种变化机制的理论提出。但他更看重的是不断提供大量证据来证明进化的真实性 —— 因为只有这些丰富的数据才能让科学界认真对待进化。（相比之下，《物种起源》作为事实的集成，与拉马克的《动物哲学》作为纯粹的理论著作相比，更能体现两者之间的显著区别。）《物种起源》几乎每一页都充满了事实，这一点在达尔文被迫调整计划，将他原本计划的更长的作品压缩成我们称为《物种起源》（The Origin of Species）的「摘要」后变得更加明显 —— 这一策略使他几乎省去了所有引用、脚注，以及信息片段间的大部分讨论性内容。在某些章节中，《物种起源》以极快的节奏连续呈现大量事实。只有达尔文严谨的秩序感和论证的逻辑性，才使这部作品免于因信息过载和内容省略而被削弱。

Whenever he introduces a major subject, Darwin fires a volley of disparate facts, all related to the argument at hand — usually the claim that a particular phenomenon originated as a product of history. This style of organization vir­tually guarantees that Whewell's "consilience of inductions" must become the standard method of the Origin. Darwin's greatest intellectual strength lay in his ability to forge connections and perceive webs of implication (that more conventional thinking in linear order might miss). When Darwin could not cite direct evidence for actual stages in an evolutionary sequence, he re­lied upon consilience — and sunk enough roots in enough directions to pro­vide adequate support for a single sturdy trunk of explanation.

每当达尔文提出一个重要主题时，他都会列出许多看似不相关但与当前论点有关的事实 —— 这些论点通常是某种现象是历史产物的主张。这种组织方式实际上确保了惠威尔所说的「归纳一致性」成为《物种起源》的标准方法。达尔文最大的智力优势在于他能建立各种联系，并发现其中隐含的关系（这种能力是线性思维可能无法做到的）。当达尔文无法引用进化过程中的直接证据时，他就依赖这种一致性 —— 在多个方向上扎下足够多的根基，从而为一个稳固的解释提供支持。

Again, Darwin starts with pigeons, unleashing a cannonade of disparate arguments, all pointing to the conclusion that modern breeds of pigeons de­rive from a single ancestral stock. None of these facts permits the construc­tion of an actual temporal series (methods one and two); but all identify the features of a current configuration that point to history as the underlying cause. Darwin, as usual, proceeds by particular example, but I doubt that a better general description of consilience could be formulated:

再一次，Darwin 从鸽子研究入手，提出了许多看似不相关的论点，但它们都指向同一个结论：现代鸽子品种都起源于同一个祖先种群。虽然这些事实还不足以构建一条明确的时间线（方法一和方法二），但它们都揭示了当前鸽子特征背后的历史原因。正如往常一样，Darwin 通过具体的例子进行论证，我怀疑是否能有比这更好的整体性描述：

From these several reasons, namely, the improbability of man having formerly got seven or eight supposed species of pigeons to breed freely under domestication; these supposed species being quite unknown in a wild state, and their becoming nowhere feral; these species having very abnormal characters in certain respects, as compared with all other Columbidae, though so like in most other respects to the rock pigeon; the blue color and various marks occasionally appearing in all the breeds, both when kept pure and when crossed; the mongrel offspring being perfectly fertile; — from these several reasons, taken together, I can feel no doubt that all our domestic breeds have descended from the Columba livia with its geographical subspecies (pp. 26-27).

从以下几个原因来看，我毫不怀疑我们所有的家养鸽子品种都是从岩鸽（Columba livia）及其地理亚种演化而来的。首先，人类在过去不太可能驯养出七八个假定的鸽子物种并让它们自由繁殖。此外，这些所谓的物种在野生环境中完全未知，也没有在任何地方形成野生种群。虽然这些物种在许多方面与岩鸽非常相似，但在某些特征上却非常异常。再者，无论是纯种还是杂交的情况下，所有品种中都偶尔会出现蓝色和各种标记，并且这些杂种后代完全具备繁殖能力。（pp. 26-27）

Every scholar could cite a favorite case of Darwinian consilience. For my part, I especially admire Darwin's uncharacteristically long discussion (pp. 388–406) on transport from continental sources and subsequent evolu­tion to explain the biotas of oceanic islands. Consider the main items in Dar­win's own order of presentation:

每位学者都可以引用一个自己钟爱的达尔文式的统一性案例。就我而言，我尤其钦佩达尔文在书中第 388 至 406 页对大陆生物如何迁徙并进化为大洋岛屿生物群的详细论述。我们来看看达尔文按照自己的顺序陈述的主要内容：

(1) The general paucity of endemic species on islands, contrasted with comparable areas of continents; why should God put fewer species on islands?

(2) The frequent displacement of endemic island biotas by continental spe­cies introduced by human transport. If God created species for islands, why should species designed for continents so often prove superior in competi­tion: "He who admits the doctrine of the creation of each separate species, will have to admit, that a sufficient number of the best adapted plants and an­imals have not been created on oceanic islands; for man has unintentionally stocked them from various sources far more fully and perfectly than has na­ture" (p. 390).

(1）岛屿上的特有物种数量普遍较少，与大陆上相似区域相比，这种现象为何会如此？为什么上帝在岛屿上放置的物种较少？

(2）岛屿上特有的生物群落经常被人类运输引入的大陆物种所取代。如果上帝是为岛屿创造了物种，为什么那些适合大陆的物种在竞争中常常表现得更优越：「支持每个物种都是单独创造这一观点的人，不得不承认，在海洋岛屿上并没有创造出足够数量的最适应的植物和动物；因为人类无意中从各种来源比自然更充分和完美地补充了这些岛屿的生物群落」(p. 390）。

(3) Taxonomic disparity of endemic species within groups records ease of access, not created fit to oceanic environments: "Thus in the Galapagos Is­lands nearly every land bird, but only two out of the eleven marine birds, are peculiar; and it is obvious that marine birds could arrive at these islands more easily than land birds" (pp. 390-391).

(3）群体内特有物种的分类差异反映了物种迁徙的难易程度，而非其对海洋环境的适应能力：「因此，在加拉帕戈斯群岛，几乎所有陆鸟都是特有的，而在十一种海鸟中只有两种是特有的；显然，海鸟比陆鸟更容易到达这些岛屿」（第 390-391 页）。

(4) Biotas of oceanic islands often lack the characteristic groups of similar habitats on continents. On these islands, endemic members of other groups often assume the ecological roles almost always occupied by more appropri­ate or more competitive taxa in the richer faunas of continents — for example, reptiles on the Galapagos, or wingless birds on New Zealand, acting as surro­gates for mammals.

海洋岛屿的生物群往往缺少大陆上类似栖息地的典型动物群。在这些岛屿上，当地特有的物种常常扮演那些在大陆上由更具竞争力的类群占据的生态角色。例如，在加拉帕戈斯群岛，爬行动物常代替哺乳动物的角色，而在新西兰，则是无翅鸟类充当了这一角色。

(5) In endemic island species, features operating as adaptations in related species on continents often lose utility when their island residences do not feature the same environment: "For instance, in certain islands not tenanted by mammals, some of the endemic plants have beautifully hooked seeds; yet few relations are more striking than the adaptation of hooked seeds for transportal by the wool and fur of quadrupeds. This case presents no dif­ficulty on my view, for a hooked seed might be transported to an island by some other means; and the plant then becoming slightly modified, but still re­taining its hooked seeds, would form an endemic species, having as useless an appendage as any rudimentary organ" (p. 392).

在岛屿上的特有物种中，那些在大陆上作为适应性特征的功能，常常在岛屿环境中失去其作用。例如，在某些没有哺乳动物的岛屿上，有些特有植物长有美丽的钩状种子。通常，钩状种子是为了通过四足动物的毛皮传播而进化的，这是一个显著的适应性特征。然而，这种现象在我的观点中并不困难理解，因为钩状种子可以通过其他方式被带到岛屿上。植物在此过程中可能会稍作改变，但依然保留钩状种子，最终形成特有物种，而这些钩状种子则成为类似退化器官的无用附属物。（第 392 页）

(6) Peculiar morphological consequences often ensue when creatures seize places usually inhabited by other forms that could not reach an island. Many plants, herbaceous in habit on continents, become arboraceous on islands otherwise devoid of trees.

(6）当生物占据了通常无法到达岛屿的其他生物的栖息地时，往往会出现特殊的形态变化。许多在大陆上为草本植物的植物，在缺乏树木的岛屿上会变为木本植物。

(7) Suitable organisms frequently fail to gain access to islands. Why do so many oceanic islands lack frogs, toads, and newts that seem so admirably adapted for such an environment? "But why, on the theory of creation, they should not have been created there, it would be very difficult to explain" (p. 393).

(7）适应环境的生物常常无法到达岛屿。为什么许多海洋岛屿上没有青蛙、蟾蜍和蝾螈，这些动物似乎非常适合这样的环境？「但根据创造论，很难解释为什么这些生物没有在这些岛屿上被创造出来」（第 393 页）。

(8) Correlation of biota with distance. Darwin could find no report of terrestrial mammals on islands more than 300 miles from a continent. He pre­sents the obvious evolutionary explanation for a disturbing creationist co­nundrum:

(8）生物分布与距离的关系。Darwin 没有发现关于距离大陆超过 300 英里的岛屿上存在陆生哺乳动物的记载。他为创世论者困扰的难题提出了一种基于进化论的合理解释：

It cannot be said, on the ordinary view of creation, that there has not been time for the creation of mammals; many volcanic islands are suf­ficiently ancient, as shown by the stupendous degradation which they have suffered and by their tertiary strata: there has also been time for the production of endemic species belonging to other classes ... why, it may be asked, has the supposed creative force produced bats and no other mammals on remote islands? On my view this question can easily be an­swered; for no terrestrial mammal can be transported across a wide space of sea, but bats can fly across (p. 394).

从通常的创造视角来看，我们不能说没有时间来创造哺乳动物。许多火山岛屿已经非常古老，我们可以从它们经历的巨大侵蚀和第三纪地层中看出这一点。这也意味着有足够的时间产生其他类别的特有物种。那么，为什么在遥远的岛屿上，假设的创造力只产生了蝙蝠而没有其他哺乳动物呢？对此，我的解释是，因为没有陆地哺乳动物能够横跨辽阔的海洋，但蝙蝠可以飞过。（第 394 页）

(9) Correlation with ease of access. Creatures often manage to cross shal­low water barriers between a continent and island, but fail to negotiate deep-water gaps of the same distance.

(9）易接近性与生物分布的关系。生物通常能够在大陆与岛屿之间的浅水区域迁移，但在同样距离的深水区域却难以跨越。

(10) Taxonomic affinity of island endemics — perhaps the most obvious point of all: why are the closest relatives of island endemics nearly always found on the nearest continent or on other adjacent islands?

(10）岛屿特有种的亲缘关系 —— 这一点也许是最显而易见的：为什么这些岛屿特有种的近亲几乎总是能在最近的大陆或其他相邻的岛屿上找到？

Any honorable creationist, after suffering such a combination of blows, all implicating a history of evolution as the only sensible coordinating explana­tion, should throw in the towel and, like a beaten prizefighter, acknowledge Darwin as the Muhammad Ali of biology.

任何一位尊敬的创造论者，在经历了一系列将进化史视为唯一合理解释的冲击后，都应该像被打败的拳击手一样认输，并承认达尔文是生物学界的「穆罕默德·阿里」。

DISCORDANCE (DISSONANCE OF ONE). Consilience works as a cumulative argument for inferring history from objects and phenomena, rather than di­rectly from sequences. You develop a line of attack, list numerous points, and then close in for the kill. But the empirical world often fails to provide such a bounty of evidence. Often, scientists must reason from a single object or situ­ation — just the thing itself, not a network of arguments suitable for a broad consilience. Can history be inferred from such minimal information?

不一致性（不和谐的个体）。融合理论是通过物体和现象推断历史的累积性论证，而不是直接从事件顺序中得出结论。通常情况下，你会制定一个策略，列出许多证据点，然后一举成功。然而，现实世界常常无法提供如此丰富的证据。科学家常常需要从单一的对象或情况中进行推理 —— 仅仅依靠事物本身，而不是一套广泛的理论网络。那么，历史能否仅凭如此有限的信息被推断出来呢？

Thinkers, like soldiers, often show their true mettle in greatest adversity. I am particularly attracted by Darwin's approach to method 4, and have often cited his arguments in these "worst cases" as my primary illustration of his genius (Gould, 1986) — for Darwin met his greatest difficulty, and then not only devised a resolution, but also developed an argument of power and range. In other words, he turned potential trouble into one of his greatest strengths.

思想家往往像士兵一样，在逆境中展现出真正的才华。我特别欣赏达尔文在面对挑战时的方法，经常引用他在这些最困难情况下的论点来证明他的天才（Gould，1986）。达尔文不仅克服了最大的困难，还提出了一个有深度和广度的论点。换句话说，他将潜在的困境转化为他最大的优势之一。

To infer history from a single object, Darwin asserts, one must locate fea­tures (preferably several, so the argument may shade into method three) that make no sense, or at least present striking anomalies, in the current life of the organism. One must then show that these features did fit into a clearly inferable past environment. In such cases, history — as expressed by preserva­tion of signs from the past — provides the only sensible explanation for mod­ern quirks, imperfections, oddities, and anomalies.

Darwin 认为，要从一个单独的对象中推断出历史，首先要找到在当前生物体生存中没有作用或者明显异常的特征（最好找到几个，这样可以利用第三种方法进行论证）。接着，需要证明这些特征在过去的某个环境中是适用的。在这种情况下，历史通过留下过去的痕迹，为现代生物的怪癖、不完美、奇特和异常提供了唯一合理的解释。

Darwin structured the Origin of Species as a trilogy. The first four chapters lay out the basic argument for natural selection. The middle five treat dif­ficulties with the theory, and ancillary subjects that must be incorporated or explained away (rules of variation, nature of geological evidence, instincts, hybridism, and general objections). The final five chapters present the grand consilience by summarizing evidence for evolution itself — not so much for natural selection as a mechanism — from a broad range of disparate fields: ge­ology*, geographic variation, morphology, taxonomy, embryology, and so forth.

达尔文将《物种起源》分为三个部分。前四章论证了自然选择的基本观点。中间五章讨论了理论中的难点，以及一些需要解释或纳入的辅助主题（如变异的规则、地质证据的性质、本能、杂交现象和普遍的反对意见）。最后五章通过总结来自不同领域的进化证据展示出伟大的融合性 —— 这些证据更多地支持进化本身，而不仅仅是作为一种机制的自然选择 —— 相关领域包括地质学、地理分布变异、形态学、分类学、胚胎学等等。

The last part of the trilogy features method four. One might almost say that chapters 10-14 constitute one long list of examples for inferring history from the oddities and imperfections of modern objects. (This arrangement of the last part struck me with particular force, as I reread the Origin before writing this book, and realized that the introductory paragraph for almost ev­ery new subject — from geographic variation to rudimentary organs — explic­itly restates the general argument for method four.) Of course, the rest of the Origin also abounds with cases of method four, beginning as usual with ex­amples from domestication. (Darwin argues that the chicks of wildfowl hide in grass and bushes to give their mother an opportunity for escape by flight. Domesticated chickens retain this habit, which no longer makes sense "for the mother-hen has almost lost by disuse the power of flight" — p. 216.)

三部曲的最后部分介绍了第四种推断历史的方法。可以说，第 10 到第 14 章几乎都是通过现代物品的奇异和缺陷来推断历史的例子汇编。（这样的安排给我留下了深刻印象，因为在撰写这本书之前，我重读了《物种起源》，发现几乎每个新主题的引言段落 —— 从地理变异到基本器官 —— 都明确重申了第四种方法的总体论点。）当然，《物种起源》的其他部分也充满了使用第四种方法的例子，通常从驯化现象开始。（达尔文指出，野生禽类的幼鸟会躲藏在草丛和灌木丛中，以便母鸟能借机飞逃。家养的鸡仍然保留这种习性，尽管「母鸡几乎因为不常飞而失去了飞行能力」—— 第 216 页。）

Of subjects treated in this final part of the Origin's trilogy, rudimentary or­gans represent, almost by definition, the "holotype" of method four. Darwin's definition, in the first sentence of his discussion, emphasizes this theme — "organs or parts in this strange condition, bearing the stamp of inutility" (p. 450). Nature tries to give us a history lesson, Darwin argues in some frus­tration, but we resist the message as inconsistent with received wisdom about natural harmony: "On the view of each organic being and each separate or­gan having been specially created, how utterly inexplicable it is that parts, like the teeth in the embryonic calf or like the shrivelled wings under the sol­dered wing-covers of some beetles, should thus so frequently bear the plain stamp of inutility! Nature may be said to have taken pains to reveal, by rudi­mentary organs and by homologous structures, her scheme of modification, which it seems that we wilfully will not understand" (p. 480). What else but imprints of history can explain rudimentary organs? Darwin ridicules the special pleading of creationist accounts as fancy ways of saying nothing at all. "In works on natural history rudimentary organs are generally said to have been created 'for the sake of symmetry,' or in order 'to complete the scheme of nature;' but this seems to me no explanation, merely a restatement of the fact. Would it be thought sufficient to say that because planets revolve in elliptic courses round the sun, satellites follow the same course round the planets, for the sake of symmetry, and to complete the scheme of nature?" (p. 453). Always searching for analogies with a short-term human history that we cannot deny, Darwin compares rudimentary organs with silent let­ters, once sounded, in the orthography of words: "Rudimentary organs may be compared with the letters in a word, still retained in the spelling, but be­come useless in the pronunciation, but which serve as a clue in seeking for its derivation" (p. 455).

在《物种起源》三部曲的最后部分中，达尔文将痕迹器官（又称原始器官）视为他所称的「方法四」的典型例子。在讨论的开头，他指出这些器官或部位处于一种奇怪的状态，带有「无用」的标记（第 450 页）。达尔文有些不满地表示，自然界似乎在试图通过这些器官给我们上历史课，但我们却因为固守自然和谐的传统观念而不愿接受：「如果我们认为每个有机体和它们的器官都是被特别创造的，那像胚胎小牛的牙齿或某些甲虫焊接翅盖下的干瘪翅膀这样的无用部位，就显得完全无法解释！自然界似乎是故意通过痕迹器官和同源结构向我们揭示她的演化方案，但我们却故意视而不见」（第 480 页）。除了这些历史的印记外，还有什么能解释痕迹器官呢？达尔文嘲笑那些试图用创世论来解释的说法，认为这些只是美化的空话：「在自然历史的著作中，通常将痕迹器官解释为为了‘对称'或‘完成自然的计划'而存在；但这在我看来并不是解释，只是对事实的重新陈述。难道我们会认为，行星绕太阳运行是为了对称，卫星绕行星运行是为了完成自然的计划，这样的解释就足够了吗？」（第 453 页）。达尔文常常寻找与人类历史相似的例子，他把痕迹器官比作词语中不再发音但仍保留在拼写中的哑音字母：「这些痕迹器官就像单词中的字母，虽然在发音中已经没有用，但在追溯词源时却提供了线索」（第 455 页）。

Darwin continues the same argument as an underpinning for all discus­sions on other aspects of organic form. He introduces morphology as "the most interesting department of natural history, [which] may be said to be its very soul" (p. 434) and continues immediately with an example of method four: "What can be more curious than that the hand of a man, formed for grasping, that of a mole for digging, the leg of the horse, the paddle of the porpoise, and the wing of the bat, should all be constructed on the same pat­tern, and should include the same bones, in the same relative positions" (p. 434).

达尔文在讨论有机形态的其他方面时，一贯以相同的论点为基础。他将形态学描述为「自然历史中最有趣的领域，可以说是它的灵魂」(第 434 页），并接着举例说明方法四：「难道有什么比这更奇妙的吗？人的手用于抓握，鼹鼠的手用于挖掘，马的腿、海豚的桨状肢和蝙蝠的翅膀，这些竟然都是按照相同的模式构造的，并且包含相同的骨头，排列在相同的相对位置」(第 434 页）。

Similarly, the section on embryology begins with an example of method four — the branchial circulation in young bird and mammalian embryos as indications of a "community of descent" with an aquatic past. This common condition in embryonic frogs, birds, and mammals cannot reflect design for current function: "We can not, for instance, suppose that in the embryos of the vertebrata the peculiar loop-like course of the arteries near the branchial slits are related to similar conditions, — in the young mammal which is nour­ished in the womb of his mother, in the egg of the bird which is hatched in a nest, and in the spawn of a frog under water" (p. 440).

同样，胚胎学部分以方法四的一个例子开始，这个例子展示了年轻鸟类和哺乳动物胚胎中的鳃循环，作为它们与水生祖先「共同起源」的证据。这种在胚胎蛙、鸟类和哺乳动物中的共有特征无法用当前的功能设计来解释：「例如，我们不能假设脊椎动物胚胎中，在鳃裂附近动脉的独特环状路径是为了适应类似的条件，—— 无论是生活在母亲子宫中的幼年哺乳动物、在巢中孵化的鸟蛋，还是在水中生长的蛙卵」（第 440 页）。

The key argument of the section on taxonomy makes the same point in a different form: if animals had experienced no history of change, and were cre­ated in accord with current needs and functions, then why should similar an­atomical designs include creatures of such widely divergent styles of life? Dar­win writes, in the opening paragraph of his discussion on taxonomy: "The existence of groups would have been of simple signification, if one group had been exclusively fitted to inhabit the land, and another the water; one to feed on flesh, another on vegetable matter, and so on; but the case is widely differ­ent in nature; for it is notorious how commonly members of even the same subgroup have different habits" (p. 411).

本节关于分类学的关键论点以另一种方式表达：如果动物没有经历过变化的历史，并且是根据现今的需求和功能被创造的，那么为什么会有相似的解剖结构，却包括了生活方式截然不同的生物呢？达尔文在讨论分类学的开篇中写道：「如果一个群体完全适合陆地生活，另一个群体适合水中生存；一个群体以肉食为生，另一个群体以植物为食，那么群体的存在就很容易理解；但自然界的情况大不相同，因为即使是同一亚群的成员，往往也有不同的习性」（第 411 页）。

These arguments strike us as most familiar when based on organic form, but fewer evolutionists recognize that method four also under girds Darwin's two chapters on biogeography (11 and 12). Darwin uses dissonance between organism and dwelling place as the coordinating theme of these chapters: the geographic distributions of organisms do not primarily suit their current cli­mates and topographies, but seem to record more closely a history of oppor­tunities for movement. Again, Darwin presents the basic argument in his first paragraph (p. 346): "In considering the distribution of organic beings over the face of the globe, the first great fact which strikes us is, that neither the similarity nor the dissimilarity of the inhabitants of various regions can be ac­counted for by their climatal and other physical conditions."

当这些论点基于有机形式时，我们最为熟悉，但很少有进化论者意识到，方法四也在支撑达尔文关于生物地理学的第 11 章和第 12 章。达尔文在这些章节中以生物与其栖息地的不匹配作为核心主题：生物的地理分布并不一定适应它们当前的气候和地形，而更像是记录了它们迁移机会的历史。同样，达尔文在他的第一段（第 346 页）中提出了基本论点：「在考虑有机生物在全球的分布时，首先显而易见的重大事实是，各地区生物的相似性或差异性，不能仅仅用它们所处的气候和其他物理条件来解释。」

Example tumbles upon example throughout these two chapters. Darwin notes that northern hemisphere organisms of subarctic and north temperate climes maintain far closer taxonomic similarity than the current geographic separation of their continents would imply. He therefore interprets these like­nesses as vestiges of history — preserved expressions of the glacial age, when these climatic bands stood further to the north, near the Arctic Circle where all northern continents virtually touch (p. 370). He also finds too much organic similarity for the modern range of climatic differences along lines of longi­tude from north to south poles, and he again implicates the climax of glacial ages as a time of formation (with modern persistence as a vestige), when even a subarctic species might migrate in comfort, on a cold earth, across the equa­tor from north to south along a single line of longitude. Invoking a complex and graphic metaphor for history, Darwin writes of disjunct distributions on opposite hemispheres, and of geographic refugia at high altitudes of lower latitudes between these endpoints:

这两章中例子贯穿始终。Darwin 指出，北半球亚北极和北温带的生物在分类上比它们地理位置的分隔所示的更为相似。因此，他将这些相似性解释为历史的遗迹 —— 冰川时代遗留下来的特征，当时这些气候带位于北极圈附近，那里所有北方大陆几乎相连（第 370 页）。他还发现从南北极沿经线的现代气候差异，对于生物相似性来说过于巨大，并且他再次将冰川时代的高潮时期视为生物形成的阶段（这些特征以现代形式遗留），当时甚至亚北极的物种也可以在寒冷的地球上舒适地迁移，沿着一条经线从北向南跨过赤道。Darwin 用复杂生动的历史隐喻描述了对立半球的生物分布，以及在低纬度高海拔地区的地理避难所：

The living waters may be said to have flowed during one short period from the north and from the south, and to have crossed the equator; but to have flowed with greater force from the north so as to have freely in­undated the south. As the tide leaves its drift in horizontal lines, ... so have the living waters left their living drift on our mountain summits, in a line gently rising from the arctic lowlands to a great height under the equator. The various beings thus left stranded may be compared with savage races of man, driven up and surviving in the mountain fastnesses of almost every land, which serve as a record, full of interest to us, of the former inhabitants of the surrounding lowlands (p. 382).

可以说，生命之水在一个短暂的时期内从北方和南方流动，越过了赤道；但北方的水流更强劲，以至于可以自由地淹没南方。就像潮汐在水平线留下漂浮物一样，生命之水在我们的山顶上留下一系列生命的痕迹，从北极低地缓缓上升到赤道附近的高处。这些残留下来的生物可以与那些被驱赶到世界各地山区并在险峻地带生存的原始人群相比较，它们为我们提供了一个充满意义的记录，记录了周围低地曾经的居民（第 382 页）。

Everyone cites the Galapagos in a virtual catechism about Darwin's evi­dence for evolution, but few biologists can state how he invokes these islands in the Origin. Most textbooks talk about a diversity of finches, each beauti­fully adapted to available resources on different islands, or of variation in tor­toise carapaces from place to place. Both these stories exemplify both diversi­fication and current adaptive value — but Darwin speaks not a word about either case in the Origin!

几乎所有人都在提到达尔文的进化论证据时，都会引用加拉帕戈斯群岛这一例子，但实际上，很少有生物学家能准确指出达尔文在《物种起源》中是如何提到这些岛屿的。大多数教科书都会提到各种各样的雀鸟，它们各自完美地适应了不同岛屿上的资源，或者提到不同地方的龟壳变化。这两个故事都展示了物种的多样化和当前适应环境的能力 —— 但达尔文在《物种起源》中完全没有提到这两个例子！

In fact, Darwin invokes the Galapagos primarily as an extended example of method four applied to biogeography: These islands house many endemic species, necessarily created in situ according to his opponents. But why then should all these endemics bear close relationship with species on the nearby American mainland? A creationist might say that God fits creatures to im­mediate circumstances, and that the Galapagos Islands, located so near America, must resemble America in environment, and therefore be best suited to house species of the same basic design. But now we grasp the beauty of the Galapagos as an almost uncannily decisive natural experiment for the influ­ence of history. These islands do lie close to America, but could scarcely resemble the mainland less in climate, geology and topography — for the Galapagos are volcanic islands in the wake of a cool current that even permits access to the northernmost species of penguin! Therefore, if the Galapagos endemics resemble American species, they must be recording a history of acci­dental transport and subsequent evolutionary change — not similar creations for similar environments. Darwin's brilliant argument deserves citation in extenso:

事实上，达尔文主要是将加拉帕戈斯群岛作为其在生物地理学中应用的一个扩展例子：这些岛屿拥有许多特有种，根据反对者的观点，这些物种必然是在当地产生的。但为何这些特有种与邻近美洲大陆的物种有密切关系呢？创造论者可能会说，上帝让生物适应直接的自然环境，而由于加拉帕戈斯群岛靠近美洲，其环境必与美洲相似，因此最适合居住相似设计的物种。然而，我们可以体会到加拉帕戈斯的独特之处，它几乎成为一个不可思议且具有决定性意义的自然实验，展示历史的影响。虽然这些岛屿靠近美洲，但在气候、地质和地形上与大陆几乎没有相似之处。加拉帕戈斯是火山岛，位于一个凉爽洋流的影响下，甚至适合北方企鹅物种生存！因此，如果加拉帕戈斯的特有种与美洲物种相似，它们必然记录了一个偶然运输和随后的进化变化的历史，而不是相似环境中产生的相似物种。达尔文的精彩论点值得完整引用：

Here almost every product of the land and water bears the unmistakable stamp of the American continent. There are 26 land birds, and 25 of these are ranked by Mr. Gould as distinct species, supposed to have been created here; yet the close affinity of most of these birds to American spe­cies in every character, in their habits, gestures, and tones of voice, was manifest… why should this be so? Why should the species, which are supposed to have been created in the Galapagos Archipelago, and no­where else, bear so plain a stamp of affinity to those created in America? There is nothing in the conditions of life, in the geological nature of the islands, in their height or climate, or in the proportions in which the sev­eral classes are associated together, which resembles closely the condi­tions of the South American coast: in fact there is considerable dissimi­larity in these respects. On the other hand, there is a considerable degree of resemblance in the volcanic nature of the soil, in climate, height, and size of islands, between the Galapagos and Cape de Verde Archipelagos: but what an entire and absolute difference in their inhabitants! The in­habitants of the Cape de Verde Islands are related to those of Africa, like those of the Galapagos to America. I believe this grand fact can receive no sort of explanation on the ordinary view of independent creation; whereas on the view here maintained, it is obvious that the Galapagos Is­lands would be likely to receive colonists . . . from America; and the Cape de Verde Islands from Africa; and that such colonists would be lia­ble to modifications — the principle of inheritance still betraying their original birth place (pp. 397-399).

在这里，几乎每一种陆地和水域的生物都明显带有美洲大陆的印记。共有 26 种陆生鸟类，其中 25 种被 Gould 先生归类为独特的物种，据信是在此地被创造出来的。然而，这些鸟类在特征、习性、动作和声音上都与美洲的鸟类有着明显的亲缘关系…… 这是为什么呢？为什么那些被认为只在加拉帕戈斯群岛创造的物种，与美洲的物种有如此明显的联系呢？在生活条件、岛屿的地质特征、高度、气候，甚至是各类生物的比例方面，加拉帕戈斯与南美海岸的条件并不相似：实际上，这些方面有着很大的不同。另一方面，加拉帕戈斯群岛和佛得角群岛在土壤的火山性质、气候、海拔和岛屿大小上有很多相似之处，但它们的生物种类却截然不同！佛得角群岛的生物与非洲的物种有关联，就像加拉帕戈斯群岛的生物与美洲的物种有关联。我认为，这一重大事实无法通过传统的独立创造理论来解释；但根据这里提出的观点，很明显，加拉帕戈斯群岛可能从美洲接纳了新来的物种，而佛得角群岛则可能从非洲接纳了新来的物种，这些物种在新的环境中发生了变化，但仍然保留着它们原始起源地的特征。

Finally, in rereading the Origin, I was struck by another, quite different, use of the argument from imperfection — one that had entirely escaped my notice before. Darwin showed little sympathy for our traditional and venerable at­tempts to read moral messages from nature. He almost delighted in noting that natural selection unleashes a reign of terror that would threaten our moral values if we tried — as we most emphatically should not — to find ethical guidelines for human life in the affairs of nature. But I hadn't realized that he sometimes presents the apparent cruelties of nature as imperfections pointing to evolution by natural selection — imperfections relative to an inappropriate argument about morality to be sure, but imperfections that trouble our souls nonetheless, and may therefore operate with special force as suggestive argu­ments for evolution:

最后，在重读《物种起源》时，我发现了一种全新的不完美论证的使用方式，这是我之前完全没有注意到的。达尔文对我们试图从自然中解读道德信息的古老传统并不抱有同情心。他几乎是乐于指出，自然选择带来了一种恐怖的统治，如果我们试图在自然界中寻找人类道德指南（我们绝不应该这样做），这将威胁到我们的道德价值。我之前没有意识到，他有时将自然界的明显残酷视为不完美之处，并认为这些不完美是自然选择进化的证据。虽然这种不完美相对于不恰当的道德论证来说是存在的，但它们仍然使我们感到困扰，因此可能会作为进化的重要暗示性论据。

Nor ought we to marvel if all the contrivances in nature be not, as far as we can judge, absolutely perfect; and if some of them be abhorrent to our ideas of fitness. We need not marvel at the sting of the bee causing the bee's own death; at drones being produced in such vast numbers for one single act, and being then slaughtered by their sterile sisters; at the astonishing waste of pollen by our fir trees; at the instinctive hatred of the queen bee for her own fertile daughters; at ichneumonidae feeding within the live bodies of caterpillars; and at other such cases. The won­der indeed is, on the theory of natural selection, that more cases of the want of absolute perfection have not been observed (p. 472).

根据自然选择理论，令人惊讶的是，我们并没有观察到更多不够完美的情况。我们不必惊讶于自然界中的设计并非全都绝对完美，有些甚至与我们对适合性的理解相悖。比如，蜜蜂的刺会导致它们自己的死亡；雄蜂被大量生产仅仅为了完成一次任务，然后被不育的姐妹们杀掉；松树浪费大量花粉；蜂王本能地憎恨自己的可育女儿；寄生蜂在毛毛虫的活体内进食，等等。

I may have burdened readers with too much detail about Darwin's argu­ments for inferring history, but method inheres in this extended madness. My general argument holds that the Origin should be understood as a book en­compassing two opposite, but complementary, poles of science at its best and most revolutionary — first, as a methodological treatise proving by example that evolution can be tested and studied fruitfully; and second, as an intellec­tual manifesto for a new view of life and nature. As a methodological treatise, the Origin focuses upon the palpable and the small — arguing that uniformitarian extrapolation into geological scales can render all evolution. We may therefore avoid any appeal to "higher" forces that cannot be studied directly because they work only in the untestable immensity of deep time, or occur so rarely that we can entertain little hope for direct observation during the short span of human history. The disabling Lamarckian paradox — what is impor­tant can't be studied; and what can be studied isn't important — therefore dis­appears, and evolution becomes, under Darwin's system, a working science for the first time. These features of methodology potentiate Darwin's theoreti­cal overview (as we shall see in the next section), and therefore contribute in­dispensably to what may legitimately be called the essence of Darwinism, the sine quibus non for a Darwinian view of nature. This book argues that we can define such a set of basic commitments, but then maintains that these commitments have become inadequate in our times.

我可能在解释达尔文推断历史的论点时给读者提供了过多细节，但这种详细的方法论中自有其理。我的总体观点是，《物种起源》应被视作一本涵盖科学在其最佳和最具革命性时期的两个对立但互补的极点的书 —— 首先，作为一本方法论专著，通过实例证明进化是可以被测试和有效研究的；其次，作为对生命和自然的新观念的知识宣言。作为方法论专著，《物种起源》关注具体而微小的事物 —— 主张通过将均变论推断至地质尺度来解释所有进化。因此，我们可以避免依赖那些无法直接研究的「更高」力量，因为它们只在无法测试的久远年代中起作用，或是发生得极为罕见，以至于我们在人类短暂的历史中几乎没有可能直接观察到。困扰已久的拉马克悖论 —— 重要的事情无法被研究，而可以研究的事情却不重要 —— 因此消失了。达尔文的体系首次使进化成为一个可操作的科学。这些方法论特征对达尔文的理论概述起到了强化作用（如我们将在下一节中看到），因此对所谓达尔文主义的本质，即达尔文自然观的必要条件，作出了不可或缺的贡献。这本书认为我们可以定义这样一套基本承诺，但这些承诺在当今时代已不再充分。

Darwin as a Philosophical Revolutionary

THE CAUSES OF NATURE'S HARMONY

达尔文作为哲学上的革新者自然和谐背后的原因

Darwin and William Paley

In November 1859, just a week before the official publication date of the Ori­gin, Darwin wrote to his neighbor John Lubbock* "I do not think I hardly ever admired a book more than Paley's 'Natural Theology.' I could almost formerly have said it by heart" (in F. Darwin, 1887, volume 2, p. 219).

1859 年 11 月，在《物种起源》正式出版前的一周，达尔文写信给邻居 John Lubbock：「我几乎没有比 Paley 的《自然神学》更让我钦佩的书了。我曾经几乎可以把它背下来。」（引自 F. Darwin，1887，第 2 卷，第 219 页）。

The Reverend James McCosh receives my vote for the most interesting among a largely forgotten group of late 19th century thinkers who played a vital role in their own time — liberal theologians friendly to evolution (though not usually to Darwin's philosophy), and who prove that if any warring camps can be designated in this realm, the combatants surely cannot be la­beled as science vs. religion (see Gould, 1999b), but rather as expressions of a much deeper struggle between tradition and reform, or dogmatics and open­ness to change. McCosh doesn't even merit a line in the Encyclopedia Britannica, though he did serve as president of Princeton University, where he had a major influence on the career of Henry Fairfield Osborn and other important American evolutionists.

在 19 世纪后期的一群思想家中，詹姆斯·麦科什牧师是我认为最有趣的一位。虽然这些思想家大多被遗忘，但在他们的时代，这些自由神学家发挥了重要作用。他们对进化论持友好态度，尽管通常不认同达尔文的哲学。这也证明了，如果要在这个领域中划分敌对阵营，绝不能简单地将其标记为科学与宗教之争（参见 Gould，1999b），而应该看作是传统与改革或教条与开放变革之间更深层次的斗争。尽管麦科什曾担任普林斯顿大学的校长，并对亨利·费尔菲尔德·奥斯本和其他重要的美国进化论者的职业生涯产生了重大影响，但他甚至在《大英百科全书》中都没有一行介绍。

In 1851, McCosh published an article entitled "Typical Forms" in the North British Review. Hugh Miller, the self-taught Scottish geologist and gen­eral thinker, called this article "at once the most suggestive and ingenious which we have almost ever perused," and urged McCosh to expand his argu­ment to an entire volume. McCosh accepted this advice and, in collaboration with George Dickie, published Typical Forms and Species Ends in Creation in 1869. The Greek inscription on the title page — typos kai telos (type and purpose) — epitomizes the argument. McCosh holds that God's order and benev­olence may be inferred from two almost contradictory properties that reside in tension within all natural objects — "the principle of order" and "the prin­ciple of special adaptation." (These two principles persist in Darwin's formu­lation under the names "Unity of Type" and "Conditions of Existence" — 1859, p. 206, for example (see my extensive treatment of this passage on pp. 251–260), where their fundamental character merits upper case designa­tions from Darwin.) McCosh defines his first principle as "a general plan, pattern, or type, to which every given object is made to conform"; and his second as a "particular end, by which each object, while constructed after a general model is, at the same time, accommodated to the situation which it has to occupy, and a purpose which it is intended to serve" (1869, p. 1). (If we call these two principles "anatomical ground plan" and "adaptation" we will be able to make the appropriate evolutionary translation without difficulty.)

1851 年，McCosh 在《北不列颠评论》发表了一篇题为《典型形式》的文章。自学成才的苏格兰地质学家和思想家 Hugh Miller 称这篇文章几乎是他读过的最具启发性和独创性的作品，并建议 McCosh 将其论点扩展成一本完整的著作。McCosh 接受了这一建议，并与 George Dickie 合作，于 1869 年出版了《创造中的典型形式和物种目的》。标题页上的希腊文铭文 ——typos kai telos（类型和目的）—— 概括了这一论点。McCosh 认为，可以从所有自然物体中存在的两种几乎矛盾的性质中推断出上帝的秩序和仁慈 ——「秩序原则」和「特殊适应性原则」。（这两个原则在达尔文的表述中以「类型统一」和「生存条件」的名称存在 —— 例如，1859 年，第 206 页（参见我在第 251-260 页对这一段的广泛论述），它们的基本性质值得达尔文用大写字母来表示。）McCosh 将第一个原则定义为「一个普遍的计划、模式或类型，所有物体都要符合」；而第二个原则则定义为「一个特定的目的，通过这个目的，每个物体在根据普遍模型构建的同时，也适应其必须占据的位置和旨在服务的目标」（1869 年，第 1 页）。(如果我们将这两个原则称为「解剖学基础结构」和「适应性」，我们就能轻松地进行适当的进化翻译。)

McCosh argues that God's existence and benevolence can be inferred from either principle — from the first by the order of taxonomy, and the abstract beauty of bodily symmetry and structure; and from the second, by "adapta­tion,"* or the exquisite fit of form to function. McCosh also notes that the second, or functional, argument constitutes the "national signature" of Brit­ish thought: "The arguments and illustrations adduced by British writers for the last age or two in behalf of the Divine existence, have been taken almost exclusively from the indications in nature of special adaptation of parts" (1869, p. 6).

McCosh 认为，上帝的存在和仁慈可以从两个原则中推断出来。第一个原则是通过观察分类学的秩序，以及身体结构对称性的抽象美感。第二个原则则是通过「适应性」，即形态与功能的精妙匹配来推断。McCosh 还指出，第二个原则，即功能性论证，是英国思想的「国家标志」：「在过去的一两个世纪中，英国作家为支持神的存在所提出的论点和例证，几乎完全依赖于自然界中各部分的特殊适应性迹象。」（1869，p. 6）

The main lineage of this national tradition for "natural theology" based on the "argument from design" runs from Robert Boyle's Disquisition About the Final Causes of Natural Things (1688) and John Ray's Wisdom of God Mani­fested in the Works of the Creation (1691) in Newton's generation that pro­mulgated what historians call "the scientific revolution"; to a grand culmina­tion in William Paley's Natural Theology (1802), one of the most influential books of the 19th century; to an anticlimax, during the 1830's, in the eight "Bridgewater Treatises" (including volumes by Buckland and Whewell), es­tablished by a legacy from the deceased Earl of Bridgewater for a series of volumes "on the power, wisdom, and goodness of God, as manifested in the creation." Critics in Darwin's circle generally referred to this series as the "bilgewater treatises."

这一国家传统的「自然神学」，其主要脉络基于「设计论证」。这一脉络可以追溯到牛顿时代，当时历史学家称之为「科学革命」。罗伯特·波义耳在 1688 年写作的《论自然事物的最终原因》和约翰·雷在 1691 年写作的《上帝的智慧展现在创造物中》是这一传统的开端。随后在 19 世纪，威廉·佩利于 1802 年出版的《自然神学》将其推向巅峰，成为当时最具影响力的著作之一。然而，到了 1830 年代，由已故布里奇沃特伯爵的遗产资助的八本「布里奇沃特论文集」（包括巴克兰和惠威尔的卷）出版，这标志着此传统的衰落。这些论文集旨在探讨「上帝的力量、智慧和善良如同在创造中所展现的」。达尔文圈子里的批评者通常戏称这一系列为「无意义论文集」。

Revolutions usually begin as replacements for older certainties, and not as pristine discoveries in uncharted terrain. In understanding the second pole of Darwin's genius as the uncompromising radicalism of his new philosophy for life and history, we must first characterize the comfortable orthodoxy uprooted by the theory of natural selection. Darwin's essential argument begins with a definition of the dominant philosophy for natural history in his day — natural theology in the Paleyan mode.

革命往往是对过去确定性的替换，而不是在未知领域中的全新发现。要理解达尔文思想的第二个方面，即他在生命和历史哲学中的激进创新，我们首先需要了解自然选择理论所颠覆的传统信仰。达尔文的核心论点始于对当时主流自然历史哲学的描述 —— 即佩雷风格的自然神学。

At the outset of Chapter 4, I will say more about Paley and the alternative vision of continental natural theology (adaptationism vs. laws of form). For now, a simple statement of the two chief precepts of Paleyan biology will suffice:

在第 4 章的开头，我将进一步讨论 Paley 以及与大陆自然神学相关的另一种观点（适应主义与形式法则）。目前，我们只需简单介绍 Paleyan 生物学的两个主要原则：

Natural theology in general. The rational and harmonious con­struction of nature displays the character and benevolence of a creating God. In the last four chapters of his book, Paley tells us what we may infer about God from the works of creation. God's existence, of course, shines forth in his works, but this we know from many other sources. More specifically (and with a Paleyan chapter for each), nature instructs us about God's personality, his natural attributes, his unity, and (above all) his goodness.

自然神学概论。自然界的理性和谐结构展现了创造者 —— 上帝的性格和仁慈。在书的最后四章中，Paley 向我们揭示了可以从自然界的创造中推测出的关于上帝的特征。虽然上帝的存在在他的创造中已然显现，但我们通过其他许多途径也能得知这一点。更具体地（每一章对应 Paley 的一个主题），自然告诉我们关于上帝的个性、他的自然属性、他的统一性，尤其是他的善良。

Paley's particular version of natural theology. Natural theology has been expressed in two basic modes (see Chapter 4), one primar­ily continental (laws of form), the other mainly British (adaptationism). Paley held that God manifests his creating power in the exquisite design of organ­isms for their immediate function. We all know Paley's famous opening meta­phor: if I find a watch lying abandoned on an open field, I can conclude from the complex set of parts, all shaped to a common purpose and all well de­signed for a specific end, that some higher intelligence constructed the watch both directly and for a particular use. Since organisms show even more com­plexity and even more exquisite design, they must have been fashioned by an even greater intelligence. But fewer biologists know Paley's more specific ar­gument against the alternative version of natural theology (laws of form), as presented in his chapter 15 on "relations." The parts of organisms exist in concert not because laws of form or symmetry demand one feature to balance another, but "from the relation which the parts bear to one another in the prosecution of a common purpose" (1803 edition, p. 296) — that is, to secure an optimal adaptation of the whole.

帕利关于自然神学的特定观点。自然神学如第四章所述，主要有两种表达方式：一种主要在大陆上流行（形式法则），另一种主要在英国（适应主义）。帕利认为，上帝通过生物体的精巧设计展现了其创造的力量。我们都熟悉帕利著名的开场隐喻：如果我在空地上发现一只被遗弃的手表，可以从其复杂且为共同目的精心设计的零件推断出，是某种更高的智慧直接制造了这只手表并赋予其特定用途。由于生物体展示出更加复杂和精巧的设计，它们必定是由更伟大的智慧创造的。然而，了解帕利针对自然神学另一种版本（形式法则）的具体论点的生物学家并不多。在他第 15 章关于「关系」中指出，生物体的各部分并不是因为形式或对称法则的要求而共同存在，而是「由于各部分之间为了执行共同目的而存在的关系」（1803 年版，第 296 页）—— 也就是说，为了确保整体的最佳适应性。

At the very outset of the Origin, Darwin tells us that his explanation of evolution will stress the Paleyan problem of exquisite adaptation. He writes, in the Introduction, that we could obtain sufficient confidence about evo­lution by "reflecting on the mutual affinities of organic beings, on their embryological relations, their geographical distribution, geological succession, and other such facts" (1859, p. 3). "Nevertheless," he continues, "such a conclusion, even if well founded, would be unsatisfactory, until it could be shown how the innumerable species inhabiting this world have been modi­fied, so as to acquire that perfection of structure and coadaptation which most justly excites our admiration" (1859, p. 3). The explanation of adapta­tion therefore stands forth as the primary problem of evolution. Many lines of evidence prove that evolution occurred. But if we wish to learn how evolu­tion works, we must study adaptation.

在《物种起源》的开头，Darwin 告诉我们，他对进化的解释将重点关注 Paleyan 所提出的精巧适应的问题。他在导言中写道，通过「思考有机体之间的相互关系、它们的胚胎学联系、地理分布、地质演变及其他类似事实」，我们可以对进化有足够的信心（1859，第 3 页）。他接着说：「然而，即使这样的结论有充分依据，仍然是不够令人满意的，除非能够解释生活在这个世界上的无数物种是如何演变，以至于获得了最让我们赞叹的结构和协同适应的完美」（1859，第 3 页）。因此，适应的解释成为进化的核心问题。许多证据已经证明了进化的存在。但如果我们想弄清楚进化如何运作，就必须研究适应。

This basic Darwinian argument operates as a close copy of Paley's defense, recast in evolutionary language, for the English alternative in natural theology. We can infer, Paley often states, that God exists from innumerable as­pects of nature. But if we wish to know any more about the creator — his nature, his attributes, his intentions — we must study the excellence of adapta­tion via the "argument from design." Paley writes (1803, p. 60): "When we are enquiring simply after the existence of an intelligent Creator, imperfec­tion, inaccuracy, liability to disorder, occasional irregularities, may subsist, in a considerable degree, without inducing any doubt into the question."

这个基本的达尔文论点与帕利的辩护非常相似，它采用了进化论的语言来阐述自然神学中的英国观点。帕利常常指出，我们可以从自然界的无数现象中推断出上帝的存在。然而，如果我们想进一步了解创造者的特质、属性或意图，就必须通过「设计论证」来研究自然界的精妙适应。帕利在其 1803 年的著作中写道（第 60 页）：「当我们仅仅在探讨智能创造者的存在时，各种不完美、不准确、易于失序的现象，以及偶尔的不规则，并不会动摇这个问题的答案。」

On the other hand, adaptation in the fashioning of contrivances for definite ends reveals God's nature. Paley invokes this theme as a litany in developing his initial parable of the watch and watchmaker. He cites other possible ex­planations for the origin of the watch, and then intones, after each: "Contriv­ance is still unaccounted for. We still want a contriver" ("want," that is, in the old sense of "lack," not the modern "desire" — p. 13). "Contrivance must have had a contriver, design, a designer" (p. 14). Later, he tells us explicitly that nature can testify to God's character and goodness only by the phenome­non of adaptation (pp. 42-43): "It is only by the display of contrivance, that the existence, the agency, the wisdom of the Deity, could be testified to his ra­tional creatures. This is the scale by which we ascend to all the knowledge of our Creator which we possess, so far as it depends upon the phenomena, or the works of nature ... It is in the construction of instruments, in the choice and adaptation of means, that a creative intelligence is seen. It is this which constitutes the order and the beauty of the universe."

另一方面，为特定目的设计装置的适应性揭示了上帝的本质。Paley 在他的寓言「钟表与钟表匠」中反复强调这个主题。他提到其他关于钟表起源的可能解释，并在每个解释后重复说：「设计仍未得到解释。我们仍然缺少一个设计者」（这里的「缺少」是旧时的用法，意为「缺乏」，而非现代的「渴望」—— 第 13 页）。「设计必须有一个设计者，计划必须有一个规划者」（第 14 页）。之后，他明确指出，自然只能通过适应现象来证明上帝的性格和善良（第 42-43 页）：「只有通过展示设计，才能向理性生物证明神的存在、作用和智慧。这是我们获得关于造物主知识的途径，只要这些知识依赖于自然现象或作品…… 在工具的构建中，在手段的选择和适应中，创造性的智慧得以展现。这正是宇宙秩序和美丽的所在。」

I had never read Natural Theology straight through before pursuing my research for this book. In so doing, I was struck by the correspondences be­tween Paley's and Darwin's structure of argument (though Darwin, of course, inverts the explanation). Darwin did not exaggerate when stating to Lubbock that he had virtually committed Paley to memory. The style of Darwin's argu­ments, his choice of examples, even his rhythms and words, must often reflect (perhaps unconsciously) his memory of Paley. Consider just a few examples of this crucial linkage:

在为本书进行研究之前，我从未完整读过《自然神学》。在阅读过程中，我惊讶于帕利和达尔文论证结构之间的相似性（当然，达尔文的解释是反其道而行之的）。达尔文对卢伯克说他几乎能背诵帕利的作品，这绝不是夸张。达尔文的论证风格、例子的选择，甚至是节奏和用词，常常（也许无意识地）反映出他对帕利的记忆。请看几个重要联系的例子：

1. Paley, like Darwin, relies upon comparison and extrapolation from arti­ficial to natural. Darwin moves from artificial to natural selection, Paley from human to animal machines. Both rely on the central argument that a common mechanism works much more powerfully in nature. Paley's words recall Dar­win's argument that natural selection, working on all parts for so much time, must trump artificial selection, which only affects the few features we choose to emphasize in the short duration of human history. "For every indication of contrivance, every manifestation of design, which existed in the watch, exists in the works of nature; with the difference, on the side of nature, of be­ing greater and more, and that in a degree which exceeds all computation" (1803, p. 19).

1. Paley 和 Darwin 一样，通过比较和推断从人工现象转向自然现象。Darwin 从人工选择过渡到自然选择，而 Paley 则从人类制造的机器类比到动物的生物机器。他们都认为，自然界中存在的共同机制比人工机制更强大。Paley 的观点让人联想到 Darwin 的论述：自然选择因为作用时间长，影响范围广，必然会超越人工选择，因为人工选择只在短暂的人类历史中对我们选择强调的少数特征产生影响。「在钟表中看到的每一个设计的迹象和表现也能在自然界中找到；自然界的规模和复杂性更大，其程度超出了所有计算」（1803，第 19 页）。

2. Both men invoke the same examples. Paley compares the eye and telescope; Darwin lauds the eye as the finest example of complex natural design, and then presents an evolutionary explanation. Paley cites the swimbladder as an independent device created for life in water; Darwin illustrates homology with the tetrapod lung and proposes an evolutionary passage.

两人都使用了相同的例子。Paley 比较了眼睛和望远镜；Darwin 称赞眼睛是复杂自然设计的最佳例子，并提出了进化的解释。Paley 认为鱼鳔是为了适应水中生活而独立创造出来的装置；而 Darwin 则通过四足动物的肺来展示生物结构的相似性，并提出了一个进化过程。

3. Darwin often uses Paley's logic, sometimes against his predecessor. Paley, for example, dismisses arguments about "tendencies to order" or "principles of design" as empty verbiage, explaining nothing; a true cause must be identi­fied, namely God himself. Darwin makes the same point, but cites evolution as the true cause, while branding statements about creation ex nihilo as empty verbiage. Paley writes (p. 76): "A principle of order is the word: but what is meant by a principle of order, as different from an intelligent Creator, has not been explained either by definition or example: and, without such ex­planation, it should seem to be a mere substitution of words for reasons, names for causes."

达尔文经常运用佩利的逻辑，有时候甚至用来反驳佩利自己。例如，佩利认为「秩序的倾向」或「设计的原则」这样的说法只是空洞的语言，无法真正解释事物；他强调必须找到一个真正的原因，即上帝。达尔文也认可需要一个真正的原因，但他认为这个原因是进化，而非佩利所说的无中生有的创造，并且认为后者也是空洞无物的表述。佩利曾在第 76 页写道：「秩序的原则只是一个词汇，但什么是秩序的原则，与智慧的创造者不同，既没有通过定义也没有通过例子进行解释；在缺乏这种解释的情况下，它似乎只是用词汇代替了理由，用名称代替了原因。」

4. Paley discusses many themes of later and central importance to Darwin. He criticizes the major evolutionary conjectures of his day, including Buff on "interior molds," and the idea of use and disuse. (Since I doubt that he had read Lamarck's earliest evolutionary work by 1802, Paley probably derived this aspect of Lamarck's theory from its status as folk wisdom in general cul­ture.) Paley also states the following crisp epitome of the very argument from Malthus that so struck Darwin. (I am not claiming that this passage provided a covert source for Darwin's central insight. Darwin, after all, had also read Malthus.) "The order of generation proceeds by something like a geometrical progression. The increase of provision, under circumstances even the most advantageous, can only assume the form on an arithmetic series. Whence it follows, that the population will always overtake the provision, will pass be­yond the line of plenty, and will continue to increase till checked by the dif­ficulty of procuring subsistence" (p. 540).

Paley 讨论了许多对于达尔文来说具有重要意义的主题。他批评了他那个时代的主要进化猜想，包括 Buff 提出的关于「内部模具」的理论，以及使用与废弃的理论。（由于我怀疑他在 1802 年之前读过 Lamarck 的早期进化作品，Paley 可能是通过其在一般文化中作为民间智慧的地位得出了 Lamarck 理论的这一方面。）Paley 还提出了 Malthus 的一个简洁的论点概要，这一论点对达尔文产生了深远的影响。（我并不是说这段文字暗中成为了达尔文核心见解的来源。毕竟，达尔文也读过 Malthus。）「生殖的秩序以类似几何级数的方式进行。在即使是最有利的情况下，供给的增加也只能呈现算术级数的形式。因此，人口将始终超过供给，超越充足的界限，并将继续增加，直到因获取生计的困难而受到限制。」（第 540 页）

This influence, and this desire to overturn Paley, persisted throughout Darwin's career. Ghiselin (1969), for example, regards Darwin's orchid book as a conscious satire on Paley's terminology and argument. Darwin called this work (1862), his next book after the Origin of Species, "On the various con­trivances by which British and foreign orchids are fertilized by insects." Paley used the word "contrivance," as my previous quotations show, to designate an organic design obviously well-made by an intelligent designer. But Darwin argues that orchids must be explained as contraptions, not contrivances. Their vaunted adaptations are jury-rigged from ordinary parts of flowers, and must have evolved from such an ancestral source; the major adaptive fea­tures of orchids have not been expressly and uniquely designed for their cur­rent functions.

这种影响和推翻 Paley 的愿望贯穿了 Darwin 的职业生涯。例如，Ghiselin（1969）认为，Darwin 的兰花书实际上是在有意讽刺 Paley 的术语和观点。Darwin 在《物种起源》之后的下一本书（1862 年）名为「论英国和外国兰花如何通过昆虫授粉的各种装置」。Paley 使用「装置」一词来指代显然由智能设计者精心构造的有机设计。然而，Darwin 认为兰花应该被视为临时拼凑物，而非精心设计的装置。它们被吹捧的适应性是由普通的花部件临时组合而成的，并且必须从这样的祖先来源进化而来；兰花的主要适应特征并不是专门为其当前功能而设计的。

Now suppose, as a problem in abstract perversity, that one made a pledge to subvert Paley in the most radical way possible. What would one claim? I can imagine two basic refutations. One might label Paley's primary observa­tion as simply wrong — by arguing that exquisite adaptation is relatively rare, and that the world is replete with error, imperfection, misery and caprice. If God made such a world, then we might want to reassess our decision to wor­ship him. An upsetting argument indeed, but Darwin chose an even more rad­ical alternative.

假设有一个人要设法用最极端的方式来推翻 Paley 的观点，那么他会怎么说呢？我能想到两种基本的反驳。一种是直接指出 Paley 的主要观察是错误的 —— 通过说明精巧的适应性其实并不常见，而我们的世界充满了错误、不完美、痛苦和变化无常。如果真是上帝创造了这样的世界，我们或许需要重新考虑是否应该崇拜他。这是一个相当令人不安的观点，但 Darwin 选择了一个更加激进的替代方案。

With even more perversity, one might judge Paley's observation as un­doubtedly correct. Nature features exquisite adaptation at overwhelming relative frequency. But the unkindest cut of all then holds that this order, the very basis of Paley's inference about the nature of God, arises not directly from omnipotent benevolence, but only as a side-consequence of a causal principle of entirely opposite import — namely, as the incidental effect of or­ganisms struggling for their own benefit, expressed as reproductive success. Could any argument be more subversive? One accepts the conventional ob­servation, but then offers an explanation that not only inverts orthodoxy, but seems to mock the standard interpretation in a manner that could almost be called cruel. This more radical version lies at the core of Darwin's argu­ment for natural selection. (Darwin actually employed both versions of the radical argument against Paley, but for different aspects of his full case. He in­voked oddities and imperfections as his major evidence for the factuality of evolution (see pp. 111–116). But he used the more radical version — exqui­site adaptation exists in abundance, but its cause inverts Paley's world — to construct his mechanism for evolutionary change, the theory of natural selection.)

即便是以一种反常的视角来看，Paley 关于自然适应性的观察似乎无可争议。自然界以极高的频率展现出精妙的适应能力。然而，最具挑战性的观点在于，这种秩序 ——Paley 用来推测上帝本质的基础 —— 并不是直接源自全能的仁慈，而是生物为了自身利益、通过繁殖成功而斗争的附带结果。还有比这更具颠覆性的看法吗？我们接受了传统的观察，但随后提出了一种解释，这种解释不仅颠覆了传统观念，而且似乎嘲弄了标准解释，以至于显得近乎残酷。这种更为激进的观点正是达尔文自然选择论证的核心。(实际上，达尔文在反驳 Paley 时使用了两个激进论点的版本，但针对的是他整体论证中的不同方面。他将奇异性和不完美作为进化事实的主要证据（参见第 111-116 页）。但是，他用更激进的版本 —— 尽管精妙的适应性大量存在，但其原因却颠覆了 Paley 的世界观 —— 来构建他的进化变化机制，也就是自然选择理论。)

We all understand, of course, that the force of Darwin's radicalism extends well beyond the inversion of an explanatory order; he also undercut a pri­mary source of human comfort and solace. This book cannot address such a vital issue at any depth, but I must record the point — for this wrenching be­came so salient in subsequent human history. If the natural footprints of Paley's God — the source of our confidence in his character, his goodness and, incidentally, the only hint from nature that we should accept other revealed doctrines, in particular the idea of bodily resurrection (1803, pp. 580-581) — must be reconceived as epiphenomena of a struggle for personal success, then what becomes of nature's beauty, instruction and solace? What a bitter cup Darwin offers us, compared with Paley's sweet promise (1803, pp. 578-579): "The hinges in the wings of an earwig, and the joints of its antennae, are as highly wrought, as if the Creator had had nothing else to finish. We see no signs of diminution of care by multiplication of objects, or of distraction of thought by variety. We have no reason to fear, therefore, our being forgotten, or overlooked, or neglected."

我们当然都明白，达尔文的激进主义不仅仅是颠覆了传统的解释顺序；他还动摇了人类获得安慰和慰藉的主要来源。本书无法深入探讨这个重要的问题，但我必须指出这一点 —— 因为这种变化在后来的历史中变得尤为突出。如果帕利所描述的上帝在自然界的印记 —— 即我们对上帝性格和善良的信心来源，也是我们接受其他启示教义的唯一自然依据，尤其是身体复活的观念（1803，第 580-581 页）—— 必须被重新理解为个人成就竞争的副产品，那么自然界的美丽、启示和慰藉又将何去何从？与帕利的甜美承诺相比，达尔文提供给我们的是何等苦涩的现实（1803，第 578-579 页）：「耳蜗翅膀的铰链和触角的关节被精细地制作，就好像造物主没有其他事情要完成。我们没有看到因对象的增多而导致的关心减少，或因多样性而导致的思想分散。因此，我们没有理由担心自己会被遗忘、忽视或忽略。」

But then, the man who served as the primary focus of Paley's venera­tion had also promised that the truth would make us free; and Darwin justly argued that nature cannot provide the source of morality or comfort in any case.

然而，Paley 崇拜的那个人曾承诺，真理能让我们获得自由；而 Darwin 公正地指出，自然无法在任何情况下成为道德或安慰的来源。

Darwin and Adam Smith

Many scientists fail to recognize that all mental activity must occur in social contexts, and that a variety of cultural influences must therefore impact all scientific work. Those who do note the necessary link usually view cultural embeddedness as an invariably negative component of inquiry — a set of bi­ases that can only distort scientific conclusions, and that should be identified for combat. But cultural influences can also facilitate scientific change, for in­cidental reasons to be sure, but with crucially positive results nonetheless — the exaptive principle that evolutionists, above all, should grasp and honor! The origin of Darwin's concept of natural selection provides my favorite ex­ample of cultural context as a promoter.

达尔文和亚当·斯密许多科学家没有意识到，所有心理活动都需要在社会背景下进行，因此各种文化影响必然会对所有科学工作产生影响。那些注意到这一必要联系的人，通常会将文化嵌入视为探究过程中的负面因素 —— 一系列可能扭曲科学结论的偏见，需要识别并加以对抗。然而，文化影响也可以在偶然的情况下促进科学变革，并产生至关重要的积极成果 —— 这就是借用性原则，进化论者尤其应该理解并尊重！达尔文自然选择概念的起源是我最喜欢的文化背景促进科学进步的例子。

The link of Darwin to Malthus has been recognized and accorded proper importance from the start, if only because Darwin himself had explicitly noted and honored this impetus. But if Darwin required Malthus to grasp the central role of continuous and severe struggle for existence, then he needed the related school of Scottish economists — the laissez-faire theorists, centered on Adam Smith and the Wealth of Nations (first published in the auspicious revolutionary year of 1776) — to formulate the even more fundamental prin­ciple of natural selection itself. But the impact of Adam Smith's economics did not strike Darwin with the force of eureka; the concepts crept upon him in the conventional fashion of most influences upon our lives. How many of us can specify a definite parental admonition, or a particular taunt of our peers, as central to the construction of our deepest convictions?

达尔文和马尔萨斯的联系从一开始就受到了重视，至少是因为达尔文本人明确提到并认可了这一影响。如果说达尔文通过马尔萨斯理解了生存斗争的重要性，那么他就需要苏格兰经济学派 —— 以亚当·斯密和《国富论》（首次出版于具有重要革命意义的 1776 年）为中心的自由放任理论家 —— 来帮助他形成自然选择这一更为根本的原则。然而，亚当·斯密经济学的影响并没有令达尔文产生「尤里卡」瞬间；这些概念以一种常见的方式悄然影响了他。我们中有多少人能明确指出父母的一句告诫或同龄人的一句嘲讽对我们信念的核心影响呢？

Silvan S. Schweber (1977), a physicist and historian of science, has traced the chain of influence upon Darwin from Adam Smith's school of Scottish economists — beginning in the early 1830's, and culminating in Darwin's in­tense study of these ideas as he tried to fathom the role of individual action during the weeks just preceding his "Malthusian" insight of September 1838. I believe that Schweber has found the key to the logic of natural selection and its appeal for Darwin in the dual role of portraying everyday and palpable events as the stuff of all evolution (the methodological pole), and in overturn­ing Paley's comfortable world by invoking the most radical of possible argu­ments (the philosophical pole).

物理学家和科学史学家 Silvan S. Schweber（1977）研究了达尔文如何受到亚当·斯密所属苏格兰经济学派的影响。这个影响始于 19 世纪 30 年代初，并在 1838 年 9 月达尔文产生「马尔萨斯」洞见之前的几周内达到了高峰，那时他正努力理解个人行为的作用。我认为 Schweber 发现了自然选择的逻辑及其吸引达尔文之处：一方面，它把日常生活中的明显事件作为进化的基础（方法论的角度）；另一方面，它通过最激进的论点颠覆了 Paley 的舒适世界（哲学的角度）。

In fact, I would advance the even stronger claim that the theory of natural selection is, in essence, Adam Smith's economics transferred to nature. We must also note the delicious (and almost malicious) irony residing in such an assertion. Human beings are moral agents and we cannot abide the heca­tomb* — the death through competition of nearly all participants — incurred by allowing individual competition to work in the untrammeled manner of pure laissez-faire. Thus, Adam Smith's economics doesn't work in economics. But nature need not operate by the norms of human morality. If the adapta­tion of one requires the deaths of thousands in amoral nature, then so be it. The process may be messy and wasteful, but nature enjoys time in abun­dance, and maximal efficiency need not mark her ways. (In one of his most fa­mous letters, Darwin wrote to Joseph Hooker in 1856: "What a book a devil's chaplain might write on the clumsy, wasteful, blundering, low, and horribly cruel works of nature!") The analog of pure laissez-faire can and does operate in nature — and Adam Smith's mechanism therefore enjoys its finest, perhaps its only, full application in this analogous realm, not in the do­main that elicited the original theory itself.

实际上，我甚至更进一步认为，自然选择理论本质上是将亚当·斯密的经济学应用于自然界。值得注意的是，这样的说法中含有一种几乎讽刺的意味。作为具有道德感的人类，我们无法接受几乎所有竞争参与者因竞争而死的惨烈结局 —— 这就是让个人竞争以完全自由放任的方式进行的后果。因此，亚当·斯密的经济学在实际经济中并不适用。然而，自然界不需要遵循人类的道德标准。如果某个物种的适应需要在无情的自然界中导致成千上万其他物种的死亡，那也无所谓。虽然这个过程可能混乱且浪费，但自然界拥有充足的时间，并不追求最高效率。（在 1856 年的一封著名信件中，达尔文曾写给约瑟夫·胡克：「魔鬼的牧师可以写一部关于自然界笨拙、浪费、错误、低劣和可怕残酷的工作的书！」）纯粹自由放任的模式在自然界中可以并且确实存在 —— 因此，亚当·斯密的机制在这个类似的领域中得到最好的，或许是唯一的，完整应用，而不是在其最初理论所针对的领域中。

The primary argument of laissez-faire rests upon a paradox. One might suppose that the best path to a maximally ordered economy would emerge from an analysis conducted by the greatest experts all assembled, and given full power to execute their recommendations (the closest human analog to Paley's lone Deity), followed by the passage of laws to implement these ratio­nally-derived, higher-level decisions. Yet Adam Smith argued that a society should follow the opposite path as a best approach to this desired end: law makers and regulators should step aside and allow each individual to struggle for personal profit in an untrammeled way — a procedure that would seem to guarantee the opposite result of chaos and disorder. In allowing the mecha­nism of personal struggle to run freely, good performers eliminate the less ef­ficient and strike a dynamic balance among themselves. The "fallout," for so­ciety, yields a maximally ordered and prosperous economy (plus a hecatomb of dead businesses). The mechanism works by unbridled struggle for personal reward among individuals.

自由放任理论的主要论点建立在一个悖论之上。人们可能会认为，实现最大程度有序经济的最佳途径是集结顶尖专家进行分析，赋予他们执行建议的全权（类似于 Paley 所描述的单一神灵），然后通过法律实施这些理性的高级决策。然而，亚当·斯密提出，社会应采取相反的方法作为实现这一目标的最佳途径：立法者和监管者应退居幕后，让每个人在不受限制的情况下为个人利益而努力 —— 这一程序似乎会导致相反的结果，即混乱和无序。然而，通过让个人竞争机制自由运作，优秀者会淘汰效率较低者，并在彼此之间达到动态平衡。对社会而言，这种「结果」会带来一个高度有序和繁荣的经济（尽管会有大量企业倒闭）。这种机制通过个人之间不受约束的竞争来运作。

Schweber documents numerous sources in Darwin's wide readings for this central theme of political economy. In May 1840, for example, Darwin encountered the following passages in J. R. McCulloch's Principles of Political Economy (2nd edition of 1830 — see Schweber, 1980, p. 268):

Schweber 记录了达尔文在广泛阅读中涉及政治经济学这一核心主题的众多来源。例如，1840 年 5 月，达尔文在 J. R. McCulloch 的《政治经济学原理》（1830 年第 2 版，参见 Schweber，1980，第 268 页）中读到了以下内容：

Every individual is constantly exerting himself to find out the most ad­vantageous methods of employing his capital and labor. It is true, that it is his own advantage, and not that of society, which he has in view; but a society being nothing more than a collection of individuals, it is plain that each, in steadily pursuing his own aggrandisement, is following that precise line of conduct which is most for the public advantage (p. 149). The true line of policy is to leave individuals to pursue their own inter­ests in their own way, and never to lose sight of the maxim pas trop gouverner [not to govern too much]. It is by this spontaneous and un­constrained . . . effort of individuals to improve their conditions . . . and by them only, that nations become rich and powerful (p. 537).

每个人都在努力寻找最有利的方法来使用他的资本和劳动力。虽然他关注的是自己的利益，而不是社会的利益，但社会其实是由个人组成的。因此，当每个人专注于自身发展时，也是在间接促进公共利益（第 149 页）。政策的关键在于允许个人以自己的方式追求利益，并始终牢记「不要过多干预」的原则。正是通过个人自发的努力来改善自己的状况，国家才能走向富裕和强大（第 537 页）。

The theory of natural selection lifts this entire explanatory structure, virgo intacta, and then applies the same causal scheme to nature — a tough cus­tomer who can bear the hecatomb of deaths required to produce the best pol­ity as an epiphenomenon. Individual organisms engaged in the "struggle for existence" act as the analog of firms in competition. Reproductive success be­comes the analog of profit — for, even more than in human economies, you truly cannot take it with you in nature.

自然选择理论提升了整个解释框架，并将相同的因果模式应用于自然界 —— 自然界是一个能够承受大量死亡的强大体系，而这些死亡被视为产生最佳社会结构的副产品。个体生物在「生存竞争」中扮演的角色类似于竞争中的公司。繁殖的成功就像是获取利润 —— 因为在自然界中，你甚至比在人类经济中更无法带走这些成功。

Finally, continuing the analogy, Paley's dethronement follows the most rad­ical path of supreme irony. For, in the ideal laissez-faire economy, all firms (purified in the unforgiving fires of competition) become sleek and well-de­signed, while the entire polity achieves optimal balance and coordination. But no laws explicitly operate to impose good design or overall balance by fiat — none at all. The struggle among firms represents the only causal process at work. Moreover, this cause operates at a lower level, and solely for the benefit of individual firms. Only as an incidental result, a side-consequence, does good design and overall balance emerge. Adam Smith, in coining one of the most memorable metaphors in our language, ascribed this process to the ac­tion of an "invisible hand." In the modern terms of hierarchy theory, we might say that overall order arises as an effect of upward causation from indi­vidual struggle. We may thus gain some clarity in definition, but we can't match the original prose. In his most famous words, Smith wrote in the Wealth of Nations (Book 4, Chapter 2): "He intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention ... I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good."

最后，继续这个类比，Paley 的权威被推翻演绎了一条充满讽刺意味的激进道路。在理想的自由市场经济中，所有公司在激烈竞争的洗礼下变得更加精简和设计优良，而整体社会实现了最佳的平衡与协调。然而，并没有任何法律明确规定要通过命令实现良好的设计或整体平衡 —— 完全没有。公司之间的竞争是唯一的推动力。而且，这种推动力仅仅在较低的层面上起作用，旨在为个别公司带来利益。只有作为一个附带结果，良好的设计和整体的平衡才会出现。亚当·斯密在创造我们语言中最著名的隐喻之一时，将这一过程归功于「看不见的手」。用现代的层级理论来说，我们可以认为整体秩序是由个体竞争的向上推动作用产生的结果。我们因此可能在定义上更加清晰，但无法与原始的文字魅力相媲美。在他最著名的话中，斯密在《国富论》（第四卷第二章）中写道：「他只追求自己的利益，但在这一过程中，他常常被一只看不见的手引导，去实现一个完全不在他计划之内的目标…… 我从未见过那些声称为公共利益而交易的人做过多少实事。」

But Paley had assured us, in 500 closely-argued pages, that the analogous features of the natural world — good design of organisms and harmony of ecosystems — not only prove the existence of God, but also illustrate his na­ture, his personality, and his benevolence. In Darwin's importation of Adam Smith's argument, these features of nature become epiphenomena only, with no direct cause at all. The very observations that Paley had revered as the most glorious handiwork of God, the unquestionable proof of his benevolent concern, "just happen" as a consequence of causes operating at a lower level among struggling individuals. And, as the cruelest twist of all, this lower-level cause of pattern seems to suggest a moral reading exactly opposite to Paley's lofty hopes for the meaning of comprehensive order — for nature's in­dividuals struggle for their own personal benefit, and nothing else! Paley's ob­servations could not be faulted — organisms are well designed and ecosystems are harmonious. But his interpretations could not have been more askew — for these features do not arise as direct products of divine benevolence, but only as epiphenomena of an opposite process both in level of action and in­tent of outcome: individuals struggling for themselves alone.

但是，Paley 通过 500 页紧密论证的书向我们保证，自然界的类似特征 —— 生物体的精巧设计和生态系统的和谐 —— 不仅证明了上帝的存在，而且展示了他的本质、个性和仁慈。而在达尔文引入亚当·斯密的论点时，这些自然特征仅仅是表面现象，没有任何直接原因。Paley 所敬畏的那些被认为是上帝最辉煌作品的观察，这些无可争辩的仁慈关怀的证明，仅仅是发生在相互竞争的个体之间的低层次原因的结果。而且，最残酷的讽刺是，这种低层次模式的原因似乎暗示了一种与 Paley 对全面秩序意义的崇高期望完全相反的道德解读 —— 因为自然中的个体只为自身利益而奋斗！虽然 Paley 的观察是无可挑剔的 —— 生物体确实被设计得完美无瑕，生态系统也是和谐的，但他的解释却大相径庭 —— 因为这些特征并不是神的仁慈的直接产物，而只是一个在行动层次和结果意图上相反的过程的附带现象：个体仅为自己而奋斗。

I write this chapter with two aims in mind: first, to explicate the major sources and content of Darwin's argument; and second, to identify the truly essential claims of Darwinism, in order to separate them from a larger set of more peripheral assertions and misunderstandings — so that we can rank and evaluate the role of modern proposals and debates by the depth of their chal­lenge to the central logic of our profession's orthodoxy. To fulfill this second goal, I try to identify a set of minimal commitments required of those who would call themselves "Darwinians." I argue that this minimal account fea­tures a set of three broad claims and their (quite extensive) corollaries. I then use this framework to organize the rest of this book, for I devote the histori­cal chapters of this first part to pre- and post-Darwinian discussions of the three claims. Then, following a chapter on the construction of the Modern Synthesis as a Darwinian orthodoxy for the twentieth century, I revisit the three claims in the second part, this time by examining modern challenges to their exclusive sway.

我写这一章有两个目的：首先，解释达尔文论点的主要来源和内容；其次，找出达尔文主义中真正核心的主张，以便将它们与其他次要的观点和误解区分开来 —— 这样我们就可以根据现代提议和辩论对我们领域正统逻辑的深刻挑战来评估它们的作用。为了实现第二个目标，我尝试识别一组必要的基本原则，以供那些自称「达尔文主义者」的人遵循。我认为，这一基本论述包括三个主要主张及其广泛的推论。接下来，我用这个框架组织本书的其余部分，因为我把第一部分的历史章节集中于达尔文之前和之后对这三个主张的讨论。随后，在一章介绍现代综合理论作为二十世纪达尔文主义正统地位的内容后，我在第二部分重新审视这三个主张，这次是通过研究现代对其独特地位的挑战。

By interpreting Darwin's radical theory as a response to Paley (actually an inversion), based on an importation of the central argument from Adam Smith's laissez-faire economics, I believe that we achieve our best insight into the essential claims of Darwinism and natural selection. First, and foremost, we grasp the theoretical centrality of Darwin's conclusion that natural selec­tion works through a struggle among individual organisms for reproductive success. Darwin's choice of levels, and his attempted restriction of causality to one level alone, then becomes neither capricious nor idiosyncratic, but, rather, central to the logic of an argument that renders the former "proof" of God's direct benevolence as an epiphenomenon of causal processes acting for apparently contrary reasons at a lower level. Second, we recognize the focal role of adaptation as the chief phenomenon requiring causal explanation — for good design had also set the central problem for English traditions in nat­ural theology, the worldview that Darwin overturned by deriving the same re­sult with an opposite mechanism.

通过将达尔文的激进理论解读为对帕利观点的反驳（实际上是一种颠倒），并借鉴亚当·斯密自由放任经济学的核心论点，我们可以更好地理解达尔文主义和自然选择的基本主张。首先，我们要认识到达尔文理论的核心，即自然选择是通过个体生物之间争夺繁殖成功的斗争来实现的。达尔文选择只关注一个层次，并限制因果关系在这一层次上，这并非随意或独特，而是其论证逻辑的核心。这种逻辑将过去认为上帝直接仁慈的「证明」视为在更低层次上起作用的因果过程的附带现象，虽然这些过程看似出于相反的原因。其次，我们要认识到适应性作为需要因果解释的关键现象的重要性 —— 良好的设计曾是英国自然神学的中心问题，而达尔文通过相反的机制得出了相同的结果，从而推翻了这一传统。

These two principles — the operation of selection on struggling organisms as active agents, and the creativity of selection in constructing adaptive change — suffice to validate the theory in observational and microevolutionary expression. But Darwin nurtured far more ambitious goals (as the forego­ing discussion of his methodology illustrates, see pages 97–116): he wished to promote natural selection, by extrapolation, as the preeminent source of evo­lutionary change at all scales and levels, from the origin of phyla to the ebb and flow of diversity through geological time. Thus, the third focal claim in the Darwinian tripod of essential postulates — the extrapolationist premise — holds that natural selection, working step by step at the organismal level, can construct the entire panoply of vast evolutionary change by cumulating its small increments through the fullness of geological time. With this third premise of extrapolation, Darwin transfers to biology the uniformitarian commitments that set the worldview of his guru, the geologist Charles Lyell.

这两个原则 —— 选择作用于挣扎中的生物作为主动智能体，以及选择在适应性变化中的创造性 —— 足以验证在观察和微观进化中的理论。然而，达尔文的目标远不止于此（如前述关于他方法论的讨论中所示，见第 97-116 页）：他希望通过推断，将自然选择视为所有尺度和层次上进化变化的主要来源，从门类的起源到地质时间中物种多样性的变化。因此，达尔文的三大核心假设之一 —— 外推假设 —— 认为自然选择通过在生物层面逐步作用，可以在漫长的地质时间中，通过积累小的变化，构建出巨大的进化改变。通过这个外推假设，达尔文将他导师、地质学家查尔斯·莱尔的均变论思想应用到生物学中。

THE FIRST THEME: THE ORGANISM AS THE AGENT

OF SELECTION

第一个主题：作为选择主体的生物体

Once the syllogistic core,* the "bare bones" mechanism of natural selection, has been elucidated, two major questions — the foci of the next two sections of this chapter — must be resolved before we can understand the theory's basic operation: the issues of agency and efficacy. The basic historical context of selection — its discovery and utilization by Darwin as a refutation of Paleyan natural theology through the imported causal structure of Adam Smith's in­visible hand — grants primacy to the issue of agency (therefore treated here in the first of two sections on fundamental attributes). The rebuttal of the for­mer centerpiece of natural history — the belief that organic designs record the intentions of an omnipotent creative power — rests upon the radical demotion of agency to a much lower level, devoid of any prospect for conscious intent, or any "view" beyond the immediate and personal. So Darwin reduced the locus of agency to the lowest level that the science of his day could treat in a testable and operational way — the organism (for ignorance of the mechanism of heredity precluded any possibility of still further reduction to cellular or genic levels). The purely abstract statement of natural selection (the syllogistic core) leaves the key question of agency entirely unanswered. Selection may be in control, but on what does selection act? On the subcellular components of heredity? on organisms? on populations? on species? or on all these levels si­multaneously?

一旦自然选择的基本机制被阐明后，我们在理解这一理论的基本运作之前，必须解决两个主要问题 —— 本章接下来两个部分将重点探讨：谁在进行选择（即代理性）以及选择的效果如何（即效力）。从历史背景来看，达尔文发现并利用自然选择，反驳了帕利的自然神学，他借用了亚当·斯密的「看不见的手」这一因果结构，从而使得代理性（即谁在选择的问题）成为首要关注点（因此在关于基本属性的部分中会首先讨论）。过去，人们认为有机体的设计是全能创造者意图的体现，而达尔文则将这种「意图」降低到了一个没有意识的水平，仅限于当前和具体的个体。于是，他把选择的主体降低到当时科学能以可测试和操作的方式处理的最低层次 —— 即生物体本身（因为当时对遗传机制的无知，使得进一步降低到细胞或基因层次成为不可能）。自然选择的抽象表述并没有解答关于谁在进行选择的关键问题。选择机制可能在起作用，但它究竟作用于什么？是遗传的亚细胞成分？是生物体？是种群？是物种？还是同时作用于所有这些层次？

Darwin grasped with great clarity what most of his contemporaries never understood at all — that the question of agency, or levels of selection, lies at the heart of evolutionary causation. And he provided, from the depth of his personal convictions, the roots of his central premises, and the logic of his complete argument, a forthright answer that overturned a conceptual world — natural selection works on organisms engaged in a struggle for per­sonal success, as assessed by the differential production of surviving off­spring.

达尔文非常清晰地理解到他同时代的大多数人从未理解的东西 —— 那就是在进化的因果关系中，代理问题和选择的层级问题是核心所在。他从自己坚定的信念出发，构建了其核心理论的基础和完整论点的逻辑，并提供了一个颠覆性的新观点：自然选择作用于那些为了个人成功而奋斗的生物体，这种成功通过对比存活后代的数量来评估。

We all know that Darwin emphasized selection at the organismal level, but many evolutionists do not appreciate the centrality of this claim within his theory; nor do they recognize how actively he pursued its defense and illustration. To explicate this issue, we must reemphasize the roles of William Paley and Adam Smith in the genesis of Darwin's system — using Smith to overturn Paley.

我们都知道达尔文强调的是生物体层面的选择，但许多进化论者并没有意识到这一主张在他理论中的核心地位；他们也不清楚达尔文是如何积极地为这一主张进行辩护和阐述的。为了更好地说明这一点，我们必须重新关注威廉·佩利和亚当·斯密在达尔文体系形成中的作用 —— 以斯密的理论来反驳佩利的观点。

Adaptation and the "creativity of natural selection," as discussed in the next section, represent Darwin's evolutionary translation of Paley's chief con­cern with excellence in organic design. But the substitution of natural selec­tion for God as creative agent, while disruptive enough to Western traditions, does not express the primary feature of Darwin's radicalism. To find this root, we must pursue a different inquiry about the locus of selection. After all, se­lection might operate at the highest level of species, even communities of spe­cies, for the direct production of order and harmony. We would then, to be sure, need to abandon God's role as an immediate creator, but what a gentle dispensation compared with Darwin's actual proposal: for if the agency of se­lection stood so high, God could be reconceptualized as the loving instigator of the rules. And the rules, by working directly for organic harmony, would then embody all that Paley sought to illustrate about God's nature.

适应和「自然选择的创造力」是达尔文对帕利关于有机设计卓越性关注的进化诠释。然而，将自然选择代替上帝作为创造者，尽管对西方传统造成了冲击，但这并不是达尔文思想中最激进的部分。要理解这一点，我们需要探讨选择作用的具体位置。毕竟，选择可能发生在物种甚至物种群落的最高层次，以直接创造秩序与和谐。虽然这意味着放弃上帝作为直接创造者的角色，但与达尔文实际的观点相比，这显得温和得多：因为如果选择的作用如此高尚，上帝可以被视为慈爱的规则制定者，而这些规则直接促进有机和谐，正是帕利试图展示的上帝本质的体现。

Darwin's inversion of Paley therefore required a primary postulate about the locus of selection. Selection operates on organisms, not on any higher collectivity. Selection works directly for the benefit of organisms only, and not for any larger harmony that might embody God's benevolent intent. Ironically, through the action of Adam Smith's invisible hand, such "higher harmony" may arise as an epiphenomenal result of a process with appar­ently opposite import — the struggle of individuals for personal success. Dar­win's revolution demands that features of higher-level phenomenology be ex­plained as effects of lower-level causality — in particular, that the struggle among organisms yield order and harmony in the polity of nature.

因此，达尔文对佩利理论的颠覆需要一个关于选择作用位置的重要假设。自然选择作用于生物个体，而不是更高层次的群体。自然选择只直接为生物个体的利益服务，而不是为了可能体现上帝仁慈意图的更大和谐。讽刺的是，通过亚当·斯密的「看不见的手」，这种「更高的和谐」可能作为一个过程的副产品出现，尽管这个过程表面上强调的是个体为个人成功而奋斗。达尔文的革命要求，高层次现象的特征需要通过低层次的因果关系来解释 —— 特别是，生物个体之间的竞争能够在自然界中产生秩序和和谐。

Darwin's theory therefore presents, as the primary underpinning for its radical import in philosophy, a "reductionist" account of broadest-scale phe­nomena to a single causal locus at a low level accessible to direct observation and experimental manipulation: the struggle for existence among organisms. Moreover, this claim for organismal agency expresses Darwin's chief desider­atum at each focus of his theory — at the methodological pole for tractability, and at the theoretical pole for reversal of received wisdom. Darwinians have often acknowledged the descriptively hierarchical character of nature — and some commentators have been misled to view Darwinism, for this reason, as hierarchical in mechanism of causal action as well. But Darwinism tries to ex­plain all these levels by one locus of causality — selection among organisms. Strict Darwinism is a one-level causal theory for rendering nature's hierarchi­cal richness. The major critique of our times, in advocating hierarchical levels of causality, therefore poses a fundamental challenge to an essential postulate of Darwin's system.

因此，达尔文的理论提出了一种「还原主义」的观点，将各种宏观现象的原因简化为一个可以直接观察和实验操作的低层次因果关系：生物体之间的生存竞争。此外，达尔文在其理论的每个关键点上强调了生物体的能动性 —— 在方法上是为了便于处理，在理论上则是为了颠覆传统观念。达尔文主义者常常承认自然界在描述上是分层的 —— 因此一些评论者误以为达尔文主义的因果机制也有层次。然而，达尔文主义试图通过一个因果点 —— 即生物体之间的选择 —— 来解释所有这些层次。严格的达尔文主义是一个单一层次的因果理论，用于展现自然的层次丰富性。因此，当前提倡因果层次的批评，构成了对达尔文体系基本假设的重大挑战。

Consider four aspects and demonstrations of Darwin's conviction about the exclusivity of selection on organisms:

Explicit statements. Darwin did not passively "back in" to a claim for the organismic level as a nearly exclusive locus. He knew exactly what he had asserted and why — and he said so over and over again. Statements that selection works "for the good of individuals" recur, almost in catechistic form, throughout the Origin: "Natural selection will never produce in a be­ing anything injurious to itself, for natural selection acts solely by and for the good of each (p. 201) . . . Natural selection acts only by the accumulation of slight modifications of structure or instinct, each profitable to the individual under its conditions of life" (p. 233). Even if higher-level order arises as a re­sult, the causal locus must be recognized as individual benefit: "In social animals [natural selection] will adapt the structure of each individual for the benefit of the community; if each in consequence profits by the selected change" (p. 87).

考虑达尔文关于生物体选择排他性的四个方面和例证：

明确的陈述。达尔文并没有被动地接受生物层面选择的观点。他非常明确地知道自己在主张什么，并多次强调。在《物种起源》中，他反复提到自然选择是「为了个体的利益而起作用」的。例如，他说：「自然选择不会在生物体内产生对自身有害的东西，因为它完全是为了每一个个体的利益而运作」（第 201 页）。自然选择通过积累细微的结构或本能的改变，为个体带来好处（第 233 页）。即使这种变化导致更高层次的秩序形成，仍然要承认，个体的利益是因果的核心：「在社会性动物中，自然选择会调整每个个体的结构，以造福群体；如果每个个体因此而受益」（第 87 页）。

Several other statements illustrate Darwin's emphasis on struggle among organisms, and his desire to avoid all implication that members of a species might amalgamate to collectivities functioning as units of selection in them­selves. He continually stresses, for example, that competition tends to be more intense among members of a single species than between individuals of different species — thus emphasizing the difficulty of forming such collectivi­ties. Moreover, Darwin's development of the theory of sexual selection, and his increasing reliance on this mechanism as his views matured, also forestalls any temptation to advocate group selection — as no form of intraspecific com­petition can be more intense than struggle among similar individuals for per­sonal success in mating.

达尔文在多个陈述中强调了生物体之间的竞争，并努力避免给人一种物种成员可以联合为一个选择单位的印象。他多次指出，同一物种成员之间的竞争往往比不同物种之间更为激烈，这表明形成这样的集体是困难的。此外，随着达尔文的理论逐渐成熟，他越来越依赖性选择理论，这也使他反对群体选择的观点更加坚定 —— 因为种内竞争中，没有什么比相似个体之间为了交配成功而进行的竞争更为激烈了。

Response to challenges in the Origin. The primary commit­ments of a theory lie best revealed, not so much in the initial exposition of their logic, but in their later employment to resolve difficulties and para­doxes. Darwin devotes much more of the Origin than most readers have gen­erally realized to defending his single-level theory of selection on organisms.

回应《物种起源》中的挑战。一种理论的核心价值往往不是在其逻辑初步阐述时展现，而是在解决困难和悖论时更为明显。达尔文在《物种起源》中投入了大量篇幅，远超出一般读者的认知，以捍卫他关于生物体选择的单一层次理论。

Darwin structured the Origin as a trilogy — a first part (4 chapters) on the exposition of natural selection, a last section (5 chapters) on the evidence for evolution, and a middle series of 5 chapters on difficulties and responses. Two chapters of this middle section treat a broad range of potential challenges to the creativity of selection and its sequelae — chapter 9 on the geological re­cord (to defend gradualism in the face of apparently contradictory evidence), and chapter 5 on laws of variation (to assert the isotropy of variation — see pp. 144–146). A third (chapter 6) treats general "Difficulties on Theory," mostly centered on gradualism.

达尔文将《物种起源》分为三部分 —— 第一部分（4 章）阐述自然选择，最后一部分（5 章）论述进化的证据，中间的 5 章讨论达尔文面对的困难以及他的回应。中间部分的两章探讨了对选择的创造力及其后果的广泛挑战 —— 第 9 章讨论地质记录（为在表面上相互矛盾的证据面前捍卫渐进主义），第 5 章说明变异法则（说明变异的各向同性 —— 见第 144–146 页）。第三章（第 6 章）探讨了一般的理论困难，主要集中在渐进主义上。

Darwin therefore devotes only two of these five chapters, 7 on "Instinct" and 8 on "Hybridism," to specific difficulties — that is, to issues of sufficient import in his mind to merit such extensive and exclusive treatment. Readers have not always discerned the common thread between these two chapters — Darwin's defense of struggle among organisms as the locus of selection. The chapter on hybridism presents, as its central theme, an argument against spe­cies selection as the cause of sterility in interspecific crosses. The chapter on instinct treats the more general subject of selection's application to behavior as well as to form, but Darwin devotes more than half of this chapter to social insects, and he presents his primary examples of differentiation among castes and sterility of workers as threats to the principle of selection on organisms.

因此，达尔文在五章中仅用两章 —— 第 7 章「本能」和第 8 章「杂交」—— 来专门讨论特定的困难。在他看来，这些问题足够重要，值得如此详细和专注的讨论。然而，读者常常不易看出这两章的共同主题：达尔文为生物体之间斗争作为选择机制进行辩护。关于杂交的章节，主要论述了反对物种选择是种间杂交不育原因的观点。本能章节则探讨了选择不仅适用于形态，还适用于行为这一更普遍的主题。但在这一章中，达尔文用了一半以上的篇幅来讨论社会性昆虫，他以工蚁中不同等级和工蚁不育为例，说明这对生物体选择原则构成了挑战。

Darwin raises two separate challenges to natural selection for the case of sterile castes in the Hymenoptera. How, first of all, can sterile castes evolve adaptive differences from queens (and from each other), when individuals of these castes cannot reproduce? If non-reproductive organisms can evolve ad­aptations, mustn't selection then be working at the higher level of colonies as wholes? Darwin answers, by analogy to domesticated animals once again, that differential survival of non-reproductives may still record selection on fertile members of the population. After all, a breeder can improve the dis­tinct form of castrated animals (raised for food or labor), by mating only those fertile individuals that sire non-reproductives with the most advanta­geous traits (as recognized by the correlation of selectable features in parents with different traits in their castrated offspring):

达尔文在研究膜翅目昆虫中无繁殖能力的阶级时，提出了两个与自然选择相关的挑战。首先，这些不能繁殖的个体是如何进化出与蜂王以及其他阶级不同的适应性特征的？如果这些不具有繁殖能力的生物能够进化出适应性特征，是否意味着选择发生在整个群体的更高层次上？达尔文通过类比家养动物来解释这一现象，指出即使是无繁殖个体的生存差异，也可能反映出对群体中有繁殖能力成员的选择。就像育种者可以通过选择那些能够生出具有优势特征的无繁殖后代的繁殖个体，从而改进被阉割用于食物或劳力的动物的不同形态一样。

I have such faith in the powers of selection, that I do not doubt that a breed of cattle, always yielding oxen with extraordinarily long horns, could be slowly formed by carefully watching which individual bulls and cows, when matched, produced oxen with the longest horns; and yet no one ox could ever have propagated its kind. Thus I believe it has been with social insects: a slight modification of structure, or instinct, corre­lated with the sterile condition of certain members of the community, has been advantageous to the community: consequently the fertile males and females of the same community flourished, and transmitted to their fer­tile offspring a tendency to produce sterile members having the same modification. And I believe that this process has been repeated, until that prodigious amount of difference between the fertile and sterile females of the same species has been produced, which we see in many social insects (p. 238).

我相信选择的力量是如此强大，以至于通过仔细选择公牛和母牛的配对，可以逐渐培育出一种牛种，这种牛每次都会生长出长角。然而，单个牛却无法单独传播这一特征。我认为社会性昆虫的情况也是如此：某些个体因结构或本能上的些许变化而变得不育，这种变化对整个群体有益。因此，群体中的可繁殖雄性和雌性得以繁衍，并将这种能产生不育个体的倾向传给后代。我相信这种过程不断重复，最终导致了许多社会性昆虫中，同一物种的可繁殖雌性和不育雌性之间出现了显著差异（第 238 页）。

(This quotation illustrates a common source of misunderstanding. Darwin does often use such phrases as "advantageous to the community." By our later linguistic conventions, such a statement might seem to signify a leaning to group selectionist arguments. But these conventions did not exist in Dar­win's generation. Note how he uses this phrase only as a description of a re­sult. Darwin identifies the causal process yielding this result, in this case and almost every other time he invokes such language, as selection on organisms, with benefit to communities as an epiphenomenal effect.)

（这个引文揭示了一个常见的误解来源。达尔文确实常常使用「对群体有利」这样的表述。根据我们后来的语言习惯，这似乎意味着支持群体选择的观点。然而，在达尔文的时代，这种语言习惯并不存在。我们可以注意到，他仅用这个短语来描述结果。在这种情况下，以及他几乎每次使用这种语言时，达尔文都认为是对个体的选择，而群体的受益只是附带效果。）

The second challenge, the origin of sterility itself, seems more serious — for how could selection, especially in its necessarily gradualistic mode, promote the diminution of reproductive power in individuals? Clearly, the increasingly sterile workers cannot be promoting their own fitness; but their labor may aid their entire nest or hive. Must not the evolution of sterility therefore provide prima facie evidence for group selection, and for the failure of Darwin's argu­ment about the exclusivity of selection on organisms?

第二个挑战，即不育现象本身的起源，似乎更加严重 —— 因为选择机制，尤其是其必然的渐进模式，如何能够促进个体生殖能力的减弱呢？显然，越来越不育的工蜂无法提升自身的生存适应性；但它们的劳动可能对整个巢穴或蜂群有帮助。那么，不育现象的进化难道不是群体选择的初步证据，并且表明达尔文有关选择仅作用于个体的论点存在缺陷吗？

Darwin does indeed refer to sterility as "one special difficulty, which at first appeared to me insuperable, and actually fatal to my whole theory" (p. 236). He then offers an explanation, based exclusively on organismal selection and similar to his argument about differences in form between workers and reproductives (p. 236): "How the workers have been rendered sterile is a dif­ficulty; but not much greater than that of any other striking modification of structure; for it can be shown that some insects and other articulate animals in a state of nature occasionally become sterile; and if such insects had been social, and it had been profitable to the community that a number should have been annually born capable of work, but incapable of procreation, I can see no very great difficulty in this being effected by natural selection."

达尔文确实提到不育是「一个特殊的困难，起初我认为这是无法克服的，并且实际上对我整个理论都是致命的」（第 236 页）。接着，他给出了一个完全基于个体选择的解释，类似于他对工蜂和生殖蜂形态差异的论述（第 236 页）：「工蜂为何会不育是个难题，但这个问题并不比其他显著的结构变化更难解决。因为可以证明，一些昆虫和其他节肢动物偶尔会不育；如果这些昆虫是群居的，并且对群体有利，每年出生一些可以工作但无法繁殖的个体，我认为自然选择在实现这一点上并没有太大的困难。」

The phrase "profitable to the community" seems to imply group selection but, as argued above, this modern interpretation need not reflect Darwin's in­tent. He did not, after all, know about haplodiploidy, different degrees of relatedness, or parent-offspring conflict. He does not argue here at the locus classicus for modern theories of group selection — altruism defined as the ren­dering of aid (at personal peril or expense) to non-relatives. Rather, he views the hive as a group of cooperating bodies, all tightly related and all generated by the queen. Anything beneficial to the hive fosters the reproductive success of the queen in ordinary natural selection upon her as an individual. The ste­rility of a worker does not differ in principle from the horns of an ox — a trait not found in parents, but produced by selection on parents. A queen that can generate more sterile workers might be favored by selection just as a breeder picks cows that yield castrated oxen with longer horns.

短语「对社区有利」似乎暗示了群体选择，但如上所述，这种现代观点未必是达尔文的本意。毕竟，他当时并不了解单倍二倍体、不同亲缘关系的程度或者亲子冲突。他并没有在现代群体选择理论的经典论述中提到这种观点 —— 即将利他主义定义为对非亲属的援助（即便冒着个人风险或牺牲）。相反，他将蜂巢视为一个由紧密相关的个体组成的合作系统，这些个体都是由蜂王产生的。任何对蜂巢有利的因素都能提高蜂王在自然选择中作为个体的繁殖成功。工蜂的不育特性在本质上与牛角的存在没有区别 —— 这都是在父母中不存在但通过对父母选择产生的特征。能够产生更多不育工蜂的蜂王可能会在选择中占据优势，就像育种者会选择能产出去势后牛角更长的牛一样。

At most, one might hold that Darwin treats the entire hive as an entity — a statement about higher-level selection on the "superorganism" model (see D. S. Wilson and Sober, 1989, and Sober and Wilson, 1998). But here we meet an issue that must be regarded as more linguistic than substantive. Just as Janzen (1977) wishes to identify a clone as a single El (for "evolutionary individual"), and to treat single bodies of rotifers or aphids as parts, so too might Darwin view the bodies in a hive as iterated organs of the whole. Nonetheless, selection acts on the queen as an individual reproducer. The de­terminants of her success undoubtedly include the form and function of her sterile offspring. Natural selection can "get at" a beaver through the form of its dam, or at a bird through the shape of its nest — and we do not talk about selection on the higher-level entity of organism plus product. Why should se­lection not "get at" the queen ant or bee through the conformation of the hive and the function of its members? (See Ruse, 1980, for a parallel argu­ment, in agreement with mine, on Darwin's explanation of hymenopteran castes by organismic selection.)

有人或许会认为，达尔文将整个蜂巢看作一个实体 —— 这涉及「超级有机体」模型的高层次选择（参见 D. S. Wilson 和 Sober，1989，以及 Sober 和 Wilson，1998）。不过，这更像是一个语言问题而非实质问题。就像 Janzen（1977）认为一个克隆体是一个「进化个体」（El），并将轮虫或蚜虫的单个身体视为整体的一部分一样，达尔文可能也将蜂巢中的个体视为整体的重复器官。然而，选择实际上作用于蜂后这个个体繁殖者。她成功的关键因素无疑包括她那些不育后代的形态和功能。自然选择可以通过水坝的形态影响海狸，或通过鸟巢的形状影响鸟类 —— 我们并不把这些看作生物和其产物的整体选择。既然如此，为什么选择不能通过蜂巢的结构和成员的功能来影响蚁后或蜂后呢？（参见 Ruse，1980，关于达尔文通过有机体选择解释膜翅目昆虫阶级的类似观点，与我的看法一致。）

Darwin takes up a different challenge to the exclusivity of organismic selection in the next chapter on "Hybridism." Crosses between varieties of a species are usually fertile, but crosses between species are generally sterile, or at least greatly impaired in fecundity. Under the guiding precepts of gradualism and uniformitarian methodology, we must view species as former varieties promoted by selection to the greater difference of true distinctness. But natu­ral selection could not have built sterility in gradual degrees from an original fertility between parent and offspring — for sterility cannot benefit the hybrid individual: "On the theory of natural selection the case is especially impor­tant, inasmuch as the sterility of hybrids could not possibly be of any advantage to them, and therefore could not have been acquired by the continued preservation of successive profitable degrees of sterility. I hope, however, to be able to show that sterility is not a specially acquired or endowed quality but is incidental on other acquired differences" (p. 245).

在下一章节「杂交」中，达尔文对生物选择的排他性提出了不同的挑战。同一物种的不同变种之间的杂交通常是可育的，但不同物种之间的杂交通常是无生育能力的，或者至少生育能力大大降低。根据渐进主义和均变法则的指导原则，我们必须将物种视为通过选择从变种提升为真正不同的种类。然而，自然选择不可能从亲代与子代之间的原始生育能力逐渐导致不育性 —— 因为不育性对杂种个体没有任何好处：「根据自然选择理论，这种情况尤为重要，因为杂种的不育性对它们没有任何好处，因此不可能通过逐渐积累有利的不育程度获得。然而，我希望能够证明，不育性并不是一种特别获得或赋予的特性，而是其他获得差异的附带结果。」（第 245 页）

Darwin considers two possible explanations. He constructs his entire chap­ter on hybridism as a defense of natural selection in its ordinary, organismal mode through the rejection of one explanation based on species selection and the advocacy of another rooted in selection on organisms with an interesting twist. Darwin admits that species selection, at first glance, seems to provide a simple and attractive solution: interspecific sterility must originate as an ad­aptation of species, built and promoted to preserve integrity by preventing introgression and subsequent dissolution. (A. R. Wallace strongly promoted this view. Darwin's firm rejection led to a protracted argument that strongly colored their relationship — see Kottler, 1985; Ruse, 1980.)

达尔文考虑了两种可能的解释。在他关于杂交的一整章中，他通过否定基于物种选择的解释，并支持另一种基于生物体选择的解释，来捍卫自然选择的常规生物体模式。达尔文承认，物种选择乍一看似乎是一个简单且吸引人的解决方案：种间不育性被视为一种物种的适应性特征，其作用是通过阻止基因的渗入和后续的物种融合来保持物种的完整性。（A. R. Wallace 强烈支持这一观点。达尔文的坚决反对引发了一场长期的争论，这场争论极大地影响了他们的关系 —— 参见 Kottler，1985; Ruse，1980。）

But Darwin rejected this explanation because he could not conceive how a species might act as an entity in this manner. Nonetheless, he could not pos­sibly argue in response that hybrid sterility arose by direct selection for the trait itself. He therefore proposed a subtle argument, almost surely correct in our current judgment, for the origin of hybrid sterility as an incidental consequence of other differences established by organismal selection. A. R. Wallace, in striking contrast, remained so committed to viewing every natural phenomenon as a direct adaptation that he willingly roamed up and down among levels of selection (quite unaware of the logical difficulties thus en­tailed) until he found a locus that could support a direct adaptive expla­nation.

但达尔文拒绝了这种解释，因为他无法理解一个物种如何能够作为一个整体来行动。然而，他也没办法主张杂交不育是通过对该特征本身的直接选择而产生的。因此，他提出了一个巧妙的论点，这在我们现在看来几乎是正确的，即杂交不育的起源是生物选择导致的其他差异的附带结果。与此形成鲜明对比的是，A. R. Wallace 坚持认为每种自然现象都是直接适应的结果，为此他不惜在不同的选择层面之间反复探索（而完全没有意识到这其中的逻辑困难），直到找到可以支持直接适应性解释的依据。

Darwin argued that any population, in diverging far enough from an an­cestor to rank as a separate species, must undergo a series of changes (usually extensive), mediated by natural selection and leading to a set of unique fea­tures. Any two species will therefore come to differ in a series of traits directly built by natural selection. These disparities will probably render the two spe­cies sufficiently unlike, particularly in rates and modes of reproduction and development, that any hybrids between them will probably be stunted or infertile — not because selection acted directly for sterility, but only as an in­cidental effect of differences evolved by natural selection for other reasons. Although interspecific sterility cannot be built directly by selection for its ad­vantages to organisms, this feature can and will originate as a consequence of ordinary selection on organisms. Darwin contrasts his proposal with Wallace's alternative based on direct adaptation via species selection:

达尔文认为，任何种群要从祖先物种中分化出来成为独立的新物种，必须经历一系列通常广泛的变化，这些变化由自然选择促成，最终形成一套独特的特征。因此，任何两个物种在自然选择的影响下都会在特征上产生差异。这些差异可能导致两个物种在繁殖和发育方式上存在显著差别，导致它们的杂交后代可能发育不良或不育 —— 这并不是因为选择直接导致不育，而是自然选择为了其他目的导致差异的附带结果。虽然物种间不育不能通过选择其对生物体的优势直接形成，但这一特征可以作为对生物体进行自然选择的结果而出现。达尔文将他的观点与华莱士提出的基于通过物种选择直接适应的替代方案进行了对比：

Now do these complex and singular rules indicate that species have been endowed with sterility simply to prevent their becoming confounded in nature? I think not. For why should the sterility be so extremely different in degree, when various species are crossed, all of which we must sup­pose it would be equally important to keep from blending together? …The foregoing rules and facts, on the other hand, appear to me clearly to indicate that the sterility both of first crosses and of hybrids is simply incidental or dependent on unknown differences, chiefly in the reproduc­tive systems, of the species which are crossed (p. 260).

这些复杂而独特的规则是否意味着物种的不育性只是为了防止它们在自然界中混淆？我认为不是。因为当不同物种杂交时，为何不育性的程度会有如此大的差异？我们必须假设所有物种同样重要，以防止它们混合在一起。…… 相反，上述规则和事实在我看来清楚地表明，首次杂交和杂种的不育性只是偶然的，或是由于物种间生殖系统中未知的差异而导致的（第 260 页）。

In what I regard as Darwin's most brilliant use of his favorite device — argument by analogy — he then compares hybrid sterility with incompatibility in hybrid grafts (whereas grafts between varieties of the same species usually "take"). I find this comparison particularly compelling because we would not be tempted to construct an argument about species selection to explain the in­compatibility of grafts — as no advantage for the integrity of species accrues thereby, especially since the "experiment" of grafting between two species al­most never occurs in nature. Yet the logical structures of these two arguments about grafting and sterility, as well as the attendant results, share an identical logic — joining within species, and maintenance of separation between spe­cies, based upon incidental effects wrought by increasing degrees of differ­ence evolved for other reasons:

在我看来，达尔文最出色地运用了他最常用的类比论证。他将杂交后代的不育性与杂交嫁接的不相容性进行了比较（而同一物种内不同品种的嫁接通常是成功的）。我认为这个比较特别有吸引力，因为我们不会因为嫁接不相容而去构建一个关于物种选择的论点 —— 因为这对物种的完整性没有明显的好处，特别是因为在自然界中，跨物种嫁接几乎不会发生。然而，这两个关于嫁接和不育性的论点，其逻辑结构和结果却是相同的 —— 在同一物种内可以结合，而在物种之间则保持分离，这都是因为在进化过程中，出于其他原因逐渐形成了不同程度的差异。

It will be advisable to explain a little more fully by an example what I mean by sterility being incidental on other differences, and not a spe­cially endowed quality. As the capacity of one plant to be grafted or bud­ded on another is so entirely unimportant for its welfare in a state of na­ture, I presume that no one will suppose that this capacity is a specially endowed quality, but will admit that it is incidental on differences in the laws of growth of the two plants . . . The facts by no means seem to me to indicate that the greater or lesser difficulty of either grafting or cross­ing together various species has been a special endowment; although in the case of crossing, the difficulty is as important for the endurance and stability of specific forms, as in the case of grafting it is unimportant for their welfare (pp. 261-263).

为了更好地说明我所指的是不孕性是由于其他差异而产生的附带现象，而不是一种特意赋予的特性，我举一个例子。植物在自然状态下生存时，一种植物能够嫁接或芽接到另一种植物上的能力并不重要。因此，人们不会认为这种能力是特意赋予的特性，而会认为这只是由于两种植物生长规律的差异所导致的附带现象。事实上，我认为各种物种嫁接或杂交的难易程度并不是一种特意赋予的能力。尽管在杂交时，这种困难对于维持和稳定特定物种形式非常重要，但在嫁接时，这对植物的生存并不重要（第 261-263 页）。

Darwin then drives the point home with a lovely prose flourish (and a memo­rable visual image!) in explicitly rejecting an appeal to supraorganismal selec­tion. Nature knows no explicit principle of higher-level order. "There is no more reason to think that species have been specially endowed with various degrees of sterility to prevent them crossing and blending in nature, than to think that trees have been specially endowed with various and somewhat analogous degrees of difficulty in being grafted together in order to prevent them becoming inarched in our forests" (p. 276).

达尔文随后通过一段优美的文字（以及一个令人难忘的视觉比喻！）明确拒绝了对超有机体选择的诉求，进一步强调了他的观点。自然界中不存在更高层次秩序的明确原则。他指出：「认为物种被特别赋予了不同程度的不育性以防止它们在自然界中交叉和混合，这种想法和认为树木被特别赋予了不同程度的嫁接困难以防止它们在森林中相互结合一样荒谬」（第 276 页）。

The development of Darwin's views on organismic selec­tion. If the first edition of the Origin only marked a waystation in fluctua­tion or degree of commitment, then Darwin's stand on organismic selection, however strongly expressed in this initiating volume, might not be deemed so central to his worldview. But Ruse (1980) has documented Darwin's continu­ing and increasing attention to this issue — particularly as he argued with Wallace (see also Kottler, 1985) about the principle of incidental effects to ex­plain hybrid sterility as a side consequence of natural selection rather than a direct product of species selection. Ruse writes (1980, p. 620): "By the end of the decade [the 1860's] with respect to the animal and plant worlds, there was nothing implicit about Darwin's commitment to individual selection. He had looked long and hard at group selection and rejected it."

达尔文关于生物选择的观点是如何发展的。如果说《物种起源》的第一版仅仅是他对生物选择关注程度或承诺的一个中间阶段，那么即使他在这本开创性著作中对生物选择的立场表达得很坚定，也可能不会被认为是他世界观的核心。然而，Ruse（1980）记录了达尔文对这个问题的持续且日益增加的关注 —— 特别是在他与 Wallace 的争论中（另见 Kottler，1985），他提出了附带效应原则，用自然选择的副作用来解释杂交不育，而不是认为这是物种选择的直接结果。Ruse 写道（1980，p. 620)：「到 1860 年代末，对于动物和植物世界而言，达尔文对个体选择的坚定态度已经毫无疑问。他经过深思熟虑后否定了群体选择。」

How Darwin struggles with, and "walls off," exceptions. The exegetical literature on Darwin usually states that he allowed only two exceptions, in the entire corpus of his writing, to the exclusivity of natural se­lection on organisms — first, in permitting some form of group selection for the neuter castes of social insects, and second, for the origin of human moral behavior. I agree with Ruse (see point 2 just above) that Darwin did not stray from his orthodoxy for social insects, though some of his terminological choices invite misinterpretation today. For human morality, on the other hand, Darwin did throw in the towel after long struggle — for he could not render altruism towards non-relatives by organismal selection. Nonetheless, a theory often becomes sharpened (not destroyed or even much compromised in a world of relative frequencies) by specifying a domain of exceptions — pro­vided that the exceptions be rare in occurrence, and peculiar in form. As hu­mans, we surely have a legitimate personal interest in our moral behavior, but we cannot enshrine this property as occupying more than a tiny corner of na­ture (whatever its eventual impact upon our planet, and whatever our paro­chial concern for its uniqueness).

达尔文如何努力应对并「隔离」例外情况。在关于达尔文的研究中，通常认为他在所有著作中只为自然选择原则设定了两个例外：一是对于社会性昆虫的无性阶级允许某种形式的群体选择，二是涉及人类道德行为的起源。我同意 Ruse 的看法（参见上文第 2 点），认为达尔文在讨论社会性昆虫时并没有偏离他的正统观点，虽然他的一些用词在今天可能会被误解。然而，对于人类道德，达尔文在长时间的思索后承认失败，因为他无法通过个体选择来解释对非亲属的利他行为。尽管如此，通过明确例外的领域，一个理论往往能变得更加精确（在相对频率的世界里，并不会被削弱或受到很大影响）—— 前提是这些例外很少见且形式特别。作为人类，我们自然关心自己的道德行为，但不能将其视为自然界的重要组成部分（无论其对地球的最终影响如何，也无论我们对其独特性的关注如何）。

In the Descent of Man, Darwin presents his most interesting and extensive discussion of supraorganismal selection. As an example of his clarity on the issue of levels of selection, consider the following passage on why natural se­lection could not foster altruistic behavior within a tribe — with an explicit final statement that differential success among distinct tribes should not be called natural selection:

在《人类的由来》中，达尔文对超个体选择进行了详细而有趣的探讨。为了说明他对选择层次问题的清晰理解，以下是他关于为什么自然选择无法在部落内推动利他行为的论述。在这段话中，他明确指出，不同部落之间的差异性成功不应被称为自然选择：

But it may be asked, how within the limits of the same tribe did a large number of members first become endowed with these social and moral qualities, and how was the standard of excellence raised? It is extremely doubtful whether the offspring of the more sympathetic and benevolent parents, or of those who were the most faithful to their comrades, would be reared in greater number than the children of selfish and treacherous parents of the same tribe. He who was ready to sacrifice his life, as many a savage has been, rather than betray his comrades, would often leave no offspring to inherit his noble nature ... Therefore it seems scarcely possi­ble (bearing in mind that we are not here speaking of one tribe being vic­torious over another) that the number of men gifted with such virtues, or that the standard of their excellence, would be increased through natural selection, that is, by the survival of the fittest (1871, vol. 1, p. 163).

但是，有人可能会问，同一个部落中的许多成员最初是如何具备这些社会和道德品质的，优秀的标准又是如何提升的呢？我们很难相信，同情心强和仁慈的父母，或那些对伙伴忠诚的人，其后代会比同一个部落中自私和阴险的父母的孩子更多。那些宁愿牺牲生命也不愿背叛伙伴的人，虽然表现出高贵的品质，但往往没有留下后代继承这种美德。因此，我们几乎不可能认为（这里不讨论一个部落战胜另一个部落的情况），通过自然选择，即适者生存，能够增加具备这些美德的人数或提升他们的优秀标准（1871 年，第一卷，第 163 页）。

In the light of this conundrum, and as part of his resolution, Darwin does allow for selection at the tribal level defined as differential success of groups with more altruists: "It must not be forgotten that although a high standard of morality gives but a slight or no advantage to each individual man and his children over the other men of the same tribe, yet that an advancement in the standard of morality, and an increase in the number of well-endowed men will certainly give an immense advantage to one tribe over another" (1871, p. 166).

面对这一难题，作为解决方案的一部分，达尔文确实认为可以在部落层面进行选择。他将其定义为拥有更多利他主义者的群体所取得的差异化成功：「必须记住，虽然高道德标准对同一部落中的个体及其子女几乎没有优势，但道德标准的提升和优秀人才的增加，确实会使一个部落相对于另一个部落获得巨大的优势」（1871 年，第 166 页）。

This passage has often been quoted, but without its surrounding context of contrary alternatives and restrictive caveats, as a clean example of Darwin's move to a higher level of selection when required. But such an interpretation seriously misrepresents Darwin's motives and logic. He did make the move, but only as one factor in a surrounding context of mitigation. I regard these mitigations and restrictions to hold the line of organismal selection (ex­pressed in three distinct arguments, discussed below) as far more interesting than the move itself, for Darwin's extreme reluctance to address selection at any level other than the organismic lies so well exposed in the totality.

这段文字常被引用，但缺乏其相反选项和限制性条件的背景，因而被误解为达尔文在需要时转向更高层次选择的一个简单例子。然而，这样的解释严重曲解了达尔文的动机和逻辑。他确实进行了这种转变，但这只是他在一系列缓和措施中的一个因素。我认为这些缓和措施和限制（在下文讨论的三个不同论点中体现）比选择层次的转变本身更为有趣，因为达尔文极不愿意在个体层次之外讨论选择，这一点在他的整体理论中表现得十分明显。

1. The Descent, as a whole, rests upon the strongest mode of argument for organismal selection. Darwin did not write a separate book on human evo­lution; his ideas (mostly speculative) on this subject occupy the first, and shorter, part of a two volume treatise entitled, in full: The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex. In other words, Darwin wrote the Descent as an introduction to his general exposition of sexual selection. We might re­gard the two parts as oddly juxtaposed until we realize that many of Darwin's major arguments about human evolution — in the establishment of secondary sexual characters, and in differentiation among races, for example — invoke sexual selection by intraspecific competition, rather than ordinary natural se­lection as adaptation to external environments. As Ruse (1980) notes, Dar­win viewed sexual selection as the strongest general argument against group selection, for its theme of relentless struggle in mating among members of a population guarantees that individualism must reign, largely by precluding the formation of alliances that higher-level selection could exploit. (Modern notions of sexual selection do envision the formation of such alliances, so the argument may strike us as incorrect today — but Darwin conceived sexual selection as a hyperindividual mode.)

《人类的由来》这本书整体上是对生物选择的最强有力的论证。达尔文没有专门为人类进化写一本书，而是将他在这一主题上的想法（大多是推测性的）放在了一部两卷本著作的第一部分，这部分较短，书名为：《人类的由来及性别选择》。换句话说，达尔文写这本书是为了引入他对性选择的广泛讨论。我们可能会觉得这两部分的安排有些奇怪，直到了解到达尔文关于人类进化的许多关键论点，例如次级性征的形成和种族间的差异，主要是通过种内竞争中的性选择，而不是通过适应外部环境的普通自然选择来实现的。正如 Ruse（1980）指出的那样，达尔文认为性选择是对抗群体选择的最有力论据，因为它强调种群中个体在交配时的无情竞争，确保了个人主义的主导地位，因为这种竞争排除了可以被更高层次选择利用的联盟的形成。（现代的性选择理论确实考虑了这种联盟的形成，因此我们今天可能认为达尔文的观点不完全正确，但在达尔文看来，性选择是一种高度个人化的模式。）

2. Darwin does not present his argument for tribal selection as a happy solution to the problem of morality, but only as one potential factor among oth­ers. He also devises an argument based on organismal selection — in the form that would be called "reciprocal altruism" today: "As the reasoning powers and foresight of the members became improved, each man would soon learn from experience that if he aided his fellow-men, he would commonly receive aid in return. From this low motive he might acquire the habit of aiding his fellows" (1871, p. 163).

达尔文并未将他的部落选择理论视作解决道德问题的终极方案，而只是作为可能影响因素之一。此外，他还提出了一种基于生物个体选择的观点 —— 这一观点在现代被称为「互惠利他主义」：「随着人们的推理和预见能力不断提升，每个人会逐渐从经验中认识到，如果他帮助他人，他通常会得到回报。虽然起初可能是出于这样的动机，但他可能因此养成乐于助人的习惯」（1871 年，第 163 页）。

3. Darwin presents tribal selection as a peculiarity based on the uniqueness of human consciousness, and thus as a strictly circumscribed exception to the generality of organismal selection throughout living nature. As conscious be­ings, we become especially sensitive to the "praise and blame" of our fellows. If altruistic behavior gains a status as virtuous, then we might be persuaded — against our deeper biological drive for seeking personal advantage — to en­gage in such behaviors in order to foster praise or avoid calumny. In other words, a form of "cultural evolution," rooted in our unique level of con­sciousness, could overcome the behaviors driven by organismal selection, and could establish a preference for altruistic acts that might then serve as a basis for tribal selection. But such an argument cannot enjoy wide application in nature, as all other species lack this special mental mechanism for spreading abstract ideas against the thrust of natural selection:

达尔文将部落选择视为一种基于人类意识独特性的严格例外，因为我们是有意识的生物，我们对同伴的「赞美和批评」特别敏感。如果利他行为被视为美德，我们可能会被说服，违背我们追求个人利益的本能，以参与这些行为来获得赞扬或避免批评。换句话说，基于我们独特意识的「文化进化」可以超越生物体选择驱动的行为，并建立对可能作为部落选择基础的利他行为的偏好。但这种观点不能在自然界中广泛适用，因为其他物种都缺乏这种特殊的心理机制来传播抽象思想，从而对抗自然选择的影响：

We may therefore conclude that primeval man, at a very remote period, would have been influenced by the praise and blame of his fellows. It is obvious, that the members of the same tribe would approve of conduct, which appeared to them to be for the general good, and would reprobate that which appeared evil... A man who was not impelled by any deep, instinctive feeling, to sacrifice his life for the good of others, yet was roused to such actions by a sense of glory, would by his example excite the same wish for glory in other men, and would strengthen by exercise the noble feeling of admiration. He might thus do far more good to his tribe than by begetting offspring with a tendency to inherit his own high character (1871, p. 165).

因此，我们可以得出结论，在非常遥远的时期，原始人会受到同伴的赞美和责备的影响。很明显，同一个部落的成员会赞同那些看起来有利于集体利益的行为，并谴责那些看起来有害的行为…… 即便一个人并没有被深刻的本能驱动去为他人牺牲生命，但如果他因追求荣誉而被激励去这样做，他的榜样将激发其他人对荣誉的渴望，并通过实践增强崇高的钦佩之情。通过这种方式，他可能会比仅仅通过生育后代来传承其高尚品格，为他的部落带来更大的益处（1871，p. 165）。

Note also how Darwin, in this passage, explicitly limits within tribal bound­aries the extent of such spread against organismal selection. If some form of group selection had to be acknowledged for a special case, Darwin sought to confine its operation to the smallest aggregation within the species — and then to let these small collectivities struggle with others in a minimal context of groupiness.

请注意，达尔文在这段文字中特别指出，这种作用仅限于部落范围内，以抵御个体的自然选择。如果在特殊情况下需要承认某种形式的群体选择，达尔文希望将其限制在物种内最小的群体上 —— 然后在最小的群体性环境中，让这些小群体与其他群体竞争。

Thus, in permitting a true exception to organismal selection, Darwin's pri­mary attitude exudes extreme reluctance — restriction to minimal groupiness, provision of other explanations in the ordinary organismal mode, limitation to a unique circumstance in a single species (human consciousness for the spread of an idea against the force of organismal selection), and placement within a more general argument for sexual selection, the strongest form of the orthodox mode.

因此，当允许生物体选择的真正例外存在时，达尔文表现出极大的不情愿。他倾向于将这样的例外限制在最小的群体性上，并尝试用其他普通生物体模式来解释。他只承认在人类这一单一物种中的独特情况，即人类意识能够传播思想，从而抵抗生物体选择的力量。同时，他将这种例外置于他关于性选择的更广泛论点中，因为性选择是传统生物体模式中最强有力的形式。

In my researches for this book, I made a discovery that strongly supports this view of Darwin's attitude towards supraorganismal selection. I found that the traditional sources (Ruse, Kottler and others) did not identify Dar­win's major, explicit struggle to contain an apparent need for higher-level se­lection, and to assert exclusivity for the organismal mode. He fought a far more important battle with himself on an issue well beyond particular prob­lems raised by single taxa (sterility of worker castes or human morality): the explanation of the principle that he ranked second only to natural selection itself as a component of evolutionary theory — the "principle of divergence." (Evolutionists have not recognized this important component of Darwin's de­veloping ideas about selection because he excised this discussion as he ab­stracted his longer work to compose the Origin. But the full version exists in the uncompleted manuscript of his intended larger work — edited and pub­lished by Stauffer, 1975, but not widely read by practicing biologists.) More­over, in his long version, Darwin wrestles not with the lowest interdemic level of tribal selection, but with species selection itself. I will present a full exposi­tion in Chapter 3 (pp. 224–250), but should mention for now that Darwin's tactic closely follows his argument about human morality, and therefore emphasizes his extreme reluctance to embrace supraorganismal selection, and his almost desperate effort to confine explanation to the organismal mode. The recognition that Darwin, despite such strong reluctance, could not avoid some role for species selection, builds a strong historical argument for the ineluctability of a hierarchical theory of selection. (I shall show in Chapter 3 that none of the few 19th century scientists who truly grasped the full range and subtlety of selectionist theory could avoid important roles for levels other than the organismic.)

在为这本书进行研究时，我有一个重要发现，它强烈支持达尔文对超个体选择态度的观点。我注意到，传统的研究资料（如 Ruse、Kottler 等）并没有揭示出达尔文为限制更高层次选择而努力的主要证据，以及他坚持维护个体选择模式的意图。他面临的挑战远不止于某些特定分类群问题（例如工蜂的无性繁殖或人类道德）：而是解释他认为仅次于自然选择的进化理论核心原则 ——「分歧原则」。（由于达尔文在将其更长的著作浓缩成《物种起源》时删去了这一讨论，进化论者未能认识到这个思想的重要性。然而，其完整版本保存在他未完成的大部头手稿中，该手稿由 Stauffer 于 1975 年编辑出版，但没有被广泛阅读。）此外，在这份长篇手稿中，达尔文讨论的焦点并非部落选择的最低层次，而是物种选择本身。我将在第三章（第 224-250 页）详细阐述，不过现在可以提到的是，达尔文的策略与他关于人类道德的论点紧密相连，这表明他极不情愿地接受超个体选择，并努力将解释限制在个体选择模式内。尽管存在如此强烈的不情愿，达尔文仍然不得不承认物种选择的一定角色，这为选择理论的层次性不可避免性提供了强有力的历史论据。（我将在第三章中展示，19 世纪只有少数科学家真正理解选择理论的全面性和复杂性，他们都不得不承认个体之外的其他层次也扮演着重要角色。）

As with the next topic of creativity for natural selection (pp. 137-159), the issue of levels in selection has resounded through the entire history of evolu­tionary theory, and continues to set a major part of the agenda for modern debate — as it must, for the subject lies (with only a few others) at the very heart of Darwinian logic. Wallace never comprehended the question of levels at all, as he searched for adaptation wherever he could find it, oblivious to any problems raised by the locus of its action; Kropotkin, in asserting mutual aid, never grasped the problem either; Weismann shared Darwin's insight about the problem's fundamental nature, but also came to understand, after a long and explicit intellectual struggle with his own strong reluctance, that ex­clusivity must yield to hierarchy (pp. 197-224).

正如自然选择的创造力这一主题（第 137-159 页）所展示的，选择层次的问题贯穿了进化论的整个历史，并在现代辩论中占据重要位置。这是必然的，因为这一主题和其他少数几个主题一样，是达尔文逻辑的核心。Wallace 在寻找适应性时，没有意识到其作用地点可能带来的问题，因此未能理解层次的问题；而主张互助的 Kropotkin 也没有意识到这一点。Weismann 与达尔文一样，认识到这个问题的基本性质，并在经过一番艰难的思想斗争后，认识到排他性必须让位于等级结构（第 197-224 页）。

In our generation, Wynne-Edwards (1962) riled an entire profession by defending the classical form of group selection as a generality, while Williams (1966) penned a powerful rebuttal, urging us all to toe the Darwinian line (see Chapter 7 for a full account). The classical ethologists invoked various forms of group selection (often by default); the sociobiologists proclaimed a revolution by reaction and return to the pure Darwinism of individual advan­tage. Dawkins (1976) attempted an even stronger reduction to exclusivity for genic selection, but his false argument rests on a confusion of bookkeeping with causality, and his own later work (1982) negates his original claim, though Dawkins seems unaware of his own contradictions (see Chapter 8). Supporters of hierarchy theory — I am one, and this is a partisan book — are revising Darwinism into a multilevel theory of selection.

在我们的时代，Wynne-Edwards（1962）通过辩护群体选择的经典形式为普遍性的观点，引发了整个学界的争议，而 Williams（1966）则撰写了有力的反驳，敦促学界坚持达尔文的进化理论（详见第 7 章）。传统的动物行为学家常常引用各种形式的群体选择（通常是默认的）；而社会生物学家则声称通过返回个体优势的纯粹达尔文主义来发动革命。Dawkins（1976）试图更进一步简化为基因选择的唯一性，但他的论点错误地将记录与因果关系混淆，他后来的研究（1982）否定了他最初的主张，尽管 Dawkins 似乎没有意识到这一矛盾（详见第 8 章）。层级理论的支持者 —— 我也是其中之一 —— 正致力于将达尔文主义修订为多层次的选择理论。

This issue will not go away, and must excite both interest and passion. Nothing else lies so close to the raw nerve of Darwin's radicalism. The exclu­sivity of organismal selection, after all, provides the punch line that allowed the vision of Adam Smith to destroy the explicit beauty and harmony of Wil­liam Paley's world.

这个问题不会消失，必然会引起人们的关注和热情。没有什么比达尔文激进主义的核心更为贴近的了。毕竟，正是生物选择的排他性，使得亚当·斯密的观念能够打破威廉·佩利世界的显著美丽与和谐。

Viewed in this light, the Origin's very few statements about solace become particularly revealing. Darwin had just overturned a system that provided the philosophical basis of human comfort for millennia. What could he supply in return, as we continue to yearn for solace in this vale of tears? One might be tempted to read the few Darwinian statements about solace as peculiar, exceptional, even "soft" or illogical. But we should note another feature of these statements as well: they yield no ground whatever on the key issue of organismal struggle. Solace must be found in other guises; the linchpin of se­lection as struggle among organisms cannot be compromised.

从这个角度来看，《物种起源》中关于慰藉的少数几句话显得尤其具有启发性。达尔文刚刚推翻了一个为人类提供了几千年哲学安慰的体系。我们在这个充满艰辛的世界中继续渴望慰藉，他能提供什么作为回报呢？有人可能会将达尔文关于慰藉的少数言论视为特殊的、例外的，甚至是「脆弱」或不合逻辑的。但我们也应该注意到这些言论的另一个特点：它们在生物体斗争这一关键问题上毫不妥协。慰藉必须以其他方式获得；作为生物体间斗争的选择的关键不能受到影响。

Darwin offers two sources for solace. First, the struggle, however fierce, usually brings no pain or distress to organisms (humans, with their intrusive consciousness, have introduced a tragic exception into nature). "When we re­flect on this struggle, we may console ourselves with the full belief, that the war of nature is not incessant, that no fear is felt, that death is generally prompt, and that the vigorous, the healthy, and the happy survive and multi­ply" (p. 79).

达尔文为我们提供了两种安慰的方式。首先，尽管斗争可能非常激烈，但通常不会给生物带来痛苦或烦恼（人类由于其复杂的意识，成为了自然界中的一个悲剧性例外）。「在思考这场斗争时，我们可以放心地相信，自然界的斗争并非永无止境，生物不会感到恐惧，死亡通常是迅速的，而强壮、健康和快乐的个体能够存活并繁衍。」（第 79 页）

Second, this struggle does lead to general improvement, if only as an epiphenomenon, and whatever the cost: "As natural selection works solely by and for the good of each being, all corporeal and mental endowments will tend to progress towards perfection" (p. 489). Darwin could never compro­mise his central logic; for even this "softest" of all his statements explicitly as­serts that selection can only work on organisms — "for the good of each be­ing." And why not? The logic of organismal struggle includes both fierce beauty and empirical adequacy — whatever the psychic costs. And, since roses by other names smell just as sweet, then beauty, even as an epiphenomenon, becomes no less pleasing, and no less a balm for the soul.

其次，这种斗争确实会带来整体的改善，即便只是作为一种次要现象，无论付出什么代价：「因为自然选择只为每个生命体的利益而运作，所有的身体和精神特质都将趋向于完美」（第 489 页）。达尔文从未动摇过他的核心逻辑；即便是他所有观点中「最温和」的这一条，也明确指出选择只能作用于生物体 ——「为了每个生命体的利益」。为什么不呢？生物体之间斗争的逻辑蕴含着激烈的美丽和经验上的合理性 —— 不论心理上要付出怎样的代价。而且，既然「其他名字的玫瑰闻起来同样香甜」，那么美丽，即便作为一种次要现象，也同样令人愉悦，也是心灵的慰藉。

THE SECOND THEME: NATURAL SELECTION AS A

CREATIVE FORCE

第二个主题：自然选择作为一种创造性力量

The following kind of incident has occurred over and over again, ever since Darwin. An evolutionist, browsing through some pre-Darwinian tome in nat­ural history, comes upon a description of natural selection. Aha, he says; I have found something important, a proof that Darwin wasn't original. Per­haps I have even discovered a source of direct and nefarious pilfering by Dar­win! In the most notorious of these claims, the great anthropologist and writer Loren Eiseley thought that he had detected such an anticipation in the writ­ings of Edward Blyth. Eiseley laboriously worked through the evidence that Darwin had read (and used) Blyth's work and, making a crucial etymological mistake along the way (Gould, 1987c), finally charged that Darwin may have pinched the central idea for his theory from Blyth. He published his case in a long article (Eiseley, 1959), later expanded by his executors into a posthu­mous volume entitled "Darwin and the Mysterious Mr. X" (1979).

自从达尔文时代以来，这类事件不断重演。一位进化论者在翻阅一本达尔文之前的自然历史书籍时，偶然发现了关于自然选择的描述。他心想，这可是个重大发现，证明了达尔文的理论并非原创。或许，我甚至发现了达尔文可能直接且恶意剽窃的证据！在这些指控中，最为人所知的是伟大的人类学家和作家 Loren Eiseley 的观点。他认为在 Edward Blyth 的著作中已预见到了达尔文的理论。Eiseley 花费大量精力搜集证据，试图证明达尔文曾阅读并使用过 Blyth 的作品，但在此过程中，他犯了一个关键的词源学错误（Gould，1987c），最终指控达尔文可能从 Blyth 那里借用了他理论的核心思想。他在一篇长文中发表了这一观点（Eiseley，1959），后来他的遗产管理人将其扩展为一本名为《达尔文与神秘的 X 先生》的书（1979）。

Yes, Blyth had discussed natural selection, but Eiseley didn't realize — thus committing the usual and fateful error in this common line of argument — that all good biologists did so in the generations before Darwin. Natural selection ranked as a standard item in biological discourse — but with a crucial differ­ence from Darwin's version: the usual interpretation invoked natural selec­tion as part of a larger argument for created permanency.* Natural selection, in this negative formulation, acted only to preserve the type, constant and in­violate, by eliminating extreme variants and unfit individuals who threatened to degrade the essence of created form. Paley himself presents the following variant of this argument, doing so to refute (in later pages) a claim that mod­ern species preserve the good designs winnowed from a much broader range of initial creations after natural selection had eliminated the less viable forms: "The hypothesis teaches, that every possible variety of being hath, at one time or other, found its way into existence (by what cause or in what manner is not said), and that those which were badly formed, perished" (Paley, 1803, pp. 70-71).

是的，Blyth 确实讨论过自然选择，但是 Eiseley 没意识到一个常见但致命的错误：在达尔文之前的几代优秀生物学家早已讨论过自然选择。自然选择一直是生物学讨论中的标准话题，但与达尔文的理论有一个重要区别：通常的解释认为自然选择是为了支持被创造的永恒性。在这种观点中，自然选择只是通过消除极端的变异和不适合生存的个体，来保持物种的恒定和不可侵犯，以防止削弱被创造的形式的本质。Paley 本人提出了这一论点的一个变种，他用这种观点来反驳一种说法，该说法认为现代物种保留了从最初广泛创造中筛选出的优秀设计，因为自然选择已经淘汰了不太可行的形式：「这个假设认为，各种可能的生命形式在某个时间都以某种方式出现过（原因和方式未说明），而那些不适合的则已经灭绝。」（Paley，1803，pp. 70-71）。

Darwin's theory therefore cannot be equated with the simple claim that natural selection operates. Nearly all his colleagues and predecessors ac­cepted this postulate. Darwin, in his characteristic and radical way, grasped that this standard mechanism for preserving the type could be inverted, and then converted into the primary cause of evolutionary change. Natural selec­tion obviously lies at the center of Darwin's theory, but we must recognize, as Darwin's second key postulate, the claim that natural selection acts as the cre­ative force of evolutionary change. The essence of Darwinism cannot reside in the mere observation that natural selection operates — for everyone had long accepted a negative role for natural selection in eliminating the unfit and preserving the type.

因此，达尔文的理论并不仅仅是指自然选择的存在。几乎所有他的同事和前辈都接受了自然选择的这一设想。达尔文以其独特而激进的方式，认识到这种保持生物类型的标准机制可以被反转，并成为进化变化的主要动力。自然选择显然是达尔文理论的核心，但我们还必须承认达尔文的另一个重要观点，即自然选择是驱动进化变化的创造性力量。达尔文主义的核心并不仅仅是观察到自然选择的存在 —— 因为早在达尔文之前，人们就已普遍接受自然选择在淘汰弱者和维持生物类型中发挥的消极作用。

We have lost this context and distinction today, and our current perspective often hampers an understanding of the late 19th century literature and its preoccupations. Anyone who has read deeply in this literature knows that no argument inspired more discussion, while no Darwinian claim seemed more vulnerable to critics, than the proposition that natural selection should be viewed as a positive force, and therefore as the primary cause of evolutionary change. The "creativity of natural selection" — the phrase generally used in Darwin's time as a shorthand description of the problem — set the cardinal subject for debate about evolutionary mechanisms during Darwin's lifetime and throughout the late 19th century.

如今，我们已经不再具备过去的背景和区分，这使得我们很难理解 19 世纪晚期文学及其关注的核心问题。任何认真研究过这段时期文学的人都知道，没有哪个论点比「自然选择应被看作是一种积极力量，并因此成为进化变革的主要原因」引发了更多的讨论。同时，也没有哪个达尔文的观点比这更易受到批评。在达尔文时代，「自然选择的创造力」—— 这一用来概括问题的短语 —— 成为了当时以及整个 19 世纪晚期关于进化机制的辩论核心。

Non-Darwinian evolutionists did not deny the reality, or the operationality, of natural selection as a genuine cause stated in the most basic or abstract manner — in the form that I called the "syllogistic core" on page 125 (still used as the standard pedagogical device for teaching the "bare bones" logic of Darwinism in general and introductory college courses). They held, rather, that natural selection, as a headsman or executioner, could only eliminate the unfit, while some other cause must play the positive role of constructing the fit.

非达尔文主义者并不否认自然选择作为一种真实原因的存在或其运作方式，这一点可以用最基本或抽象的方式来陈述 —— 即我在第 125 页所称的「推理核心」（这种方式仍然是教授达尔文主义的基本逻辑和大学入门课程的标准教学工具）。他们认为，自然选择就像一个「刽子手」，只能淘汰那些不适应环境的个体，而需要有其他原因来积极塑造适应环境的个体。

For example, Charles Lyell — whom Darwin convinced about the factuality of evolution but who never (much to Darwin's sadness and frustration) accepted the mechanism of natural selection — admitted that he had be­come stymied on the issue of creativity. He could understand, he wrote in his fifth journal on the "species question" in March 1860, how natural se­lection might act like two members of the "Hindoo Triad" — like Vishnu the preserver and Siva the destroyer, but he simply could not grasp how such a force could also work like Brahma, the creator (in Wilson, 1970, p. 369).

例如，Charles Lyell—— 达尔文曾说服他接受进化的真实性，但他从未（令达尔文感到悲伤和沮丧的是）接受自然选择的机制 —— 承认自己在创造力的问题上陷入了困境。他在 1860 年 3 月关于「物种问题」的第五本日记中写道，他能够理解自然选择如何像「印度三神」中的两个成员那样运作：像维持者毗湿奴和毁灭者湿婆。然而，他就是无法理解这一力量如何能同时像创造者梵天那样运作（在 Wilson，1970，p. 369）。

E. D. Cope, chief American critic and exponent of neo-Lamarckism, chose a sardonic title to highlight Darwin's supposedly fatal weakness in claiming a creative role for natural selection. He called his book The Origin of the Fittest (1887) — a parody on Darwin's "survival of the fittest," and a motto for what natural selection could not accomplish. Cope wrote: "The doctrines of 'selec­tion' and 'survival' plainly do not reach the kernel of evolution, which is, as I have long since pointed out, the question of 'the origin of the fittest.' This omission of this problem from the discussion of evolution is to leave Hamlet out of the play to which he has given the name. The law by which structures originate is one thing; those by which they are restricted, directed, or de­stroyed, is another thing" (1887, p. 226).

E.D. Cope，美国新拉马克主义的主要批评者和倡导者，选择了一个具有讽刺意味的标题，以强调达尔文在主张自然选择拥有创造性作用时的所谓致命弱点。他将他的书命名为《适者的起源》（1887)—— 这是对达尔文「适者生存」的一种模仿，也是一句关于自然选择无法完成任务的格言。Cope 写道：「‘选择'和‘生存'的理论显然没有触及到进化的根本问题，即‘适者的起源'问题。在进化讨论中忽略这个问题，就如同在以哈姆雷特命名的戏剧中遗漏了哈姆雷特一样荒谬。结构起源的法则是一回事，而限制、引导或摧毁它们的法则则是另一回事」（1887，第 226 页）。

We can understand the trouble that Darwin's contemporaries experienced in comprehending how selection could work as a creative force when we confront the central paradox of Darwin's crucial argument: natural selec­tion makes nothing; it can only choose among variants originating by other means. How then can selection possibly be conceived as a "progressive," or "creative," or "positive" force?

当我们面对达尔文理论中的一个核心悖论时，我们可以理解达尔文的同时代人为何难以理解自然选择作为一种创造性力量的作用。这个悖论在于，自然选择本身并不创造任何事物；它只是从其他方式产生的变体中进行选择。那么，为什么自然选择会被视为一种「进步的」或「创造性的」力量呢？

In resolving this paradox, Darwin recognized his logical need, within the basic structure of his argument, to explicate the three main requirements and implications of an argument for selection's creativity: (1) the nature of varia­tion; (2) the rate and continuity of change; (3) the meaning of adaptation. This interrelated set of assertions promotes natural selection from mere exis­tence as a genuine, but secondary and negative, mechanism to domination as the primary cause of evolutionary change and pattern. This set of defenses for selection's creativity therefore ranks as the second of three essential postu­lates, or "minimal commitments" of Darwinian logic.

在面对这一悖论时，Darwin 认识到，为了阐明选择的创造性，他需要在论证的基本结构中解释三个主要要素：(1）变异的性质；(2）变化的速度和连续性；(3）适应的意义。这些相互关联的主张将自然选择从一个只是存在的、次要且消极的机制提升为进化变化和模式的主要推动力。因此，这些关于选择创造性的辩护被视为 Darwin 逻辑中三个基本假设或「最低要求」中的第二个。

As the epitome of his own solution, Darwin admitted that his favored mechanism "made" nothing, but held that natural selection must be deemed "creative" (in any acceptable vernacular sense of the term) if its focal action of differential preservation and death could be construed as the primary cause for imparting direction to the process of evolutionary change. Darwin reasoned that natural selection can only play such a role if evolution obeys two crucial conditions: (1) if nothing about the provision of raw materials — that is, the sources of variation — imparts direction to evolutionary change; and (2) if change occurs by a long and insensible series of intermediary steps, each superintended by natural selection — so that "creativity" or "direction" can arise by the summation of increments.

作为他自己解决方案的象征，Darwin 承认他所偏爱的机制并没有创造出任何东西，但如果自然选择的核心作用，即差异化的生存和死亡，可以被视为导致进化变化过程具有方向性的主要原因，那么自然选择在任何通俗的意义上都应被视为「创造性」的。Darwin 认为，自然选择必须满足两个关键条件才能发挥这样的作用：（1）变异的来源，即原材料的供应，不对进化变化赋予任何方向；（2）变化通过一系列漫长且无法察觉的中间步骤发生，每一步都由自然选择监督，这样「创造性」或「方向」可以通过增量的累积而产生。

Under these provisos, variation becomes raw material only — an isotropic sphere of potential about the modal form of a species. Natural selection, by superintending the differential preservation of a biassed region from this sphere in each generation, and by summing up (over countless repetitions) the tiny changes thus produced in each episode, can manufacture substantial, directional change. What else but natural selection could be called "creative," or direction-giving, in such a process? As long as variation only supplies raw material; as long as change accretes in an insensibly gradual manner; and as long as the reproductive advantages of certain individuals provide the statisti­cal source of change; then natural selection must be construed as the direc­tional cause of evolutionary modification.

在这些条件下，变异只是进化的基础材料，就像围绕物种模式形态的一个潜在可能的球体。自然选择通过每一代中偏向性区域的差异性保存，并在无数次重复中累积这些微小的变化，从而实现显著且有方向的变革。在这样的过程中，除了自然选择，没有什么能够被称为「创造性」或赋予方向。只要变异仅提供原材料；只要变化以不易察觉的渐进方式积累；只要某些个体因其繁殖优势成为变化的统计来源；自然选择就必须被视为进化改造的方向性驱动力。

These conditions are stringent; and they cannot be construed as vague, unconstraining, or too far in the distance to matter. In fact, I would argue that the single most brilliant (and daring) stroke in Darwin's entire theory lay in his willingness to assert a set of precise and stringent requirements for varia­tion — all in complete ignorance of the actual mechanics of heredity. Darwin understood that if any of these claims failed, natural selection could not be a creative force, and the theory of natural selection would collapse. We pay our highest tribute to the power of natural selection in recognizing how Darwin used the theory to deduce a set of necessary properties for variation, well be­fore science understood the mechanism of heredity — and in noting that these properties then turned out to be both basically correct and also entailed by the causes later discovered!

这些条件非常严格，不能被认为是模糊、不具约束力或是遥不可及的。事实上，我认为达尔文最聪明而大胆的一步，就是他敢于在完全不了解遗传机制的情况下，提出一组精确而严格的变异要求。达尔文明白，如果这些要求中的任何一个不成立，自然选择就无法成为创造性的力量，自然选择理论也会崩溃。我们对自然选择的最高赞誉在于，达尔文在科学还不了解遗传机制之前，就通过自然选择理论推导出变异所必需的性质，并且这些性质后来被证明是基本正确的，也符合后来发现的原因！

The requirements for variation

In order to act as raw material only, variation must walk a tightrope between two unacceptable alternatives. First and foremost, variation must exist in suf­ficient amounts, for natural selection can make nothing, and must rely upon the bounty thus provided; but variation must not be too florid or showy ei­ther, lest it become the creative agent of change all by itself. Variation, in short, must be copious, small in extent, and undirected. A full taxonomy of non-Darwinian evolutionary theories may be elaborated by their denials of one or more of these central assumptions.

变异的要求为了仅仅作为原材料存在，变异必须在两个不可接受的极端之间保持平衡。首先，变异必须具有足够的数量，因为自然选择无法创造任何东西，必须依赖于其提供的丰富性；但变异也不能过于显著，否则它可能会成为变化的唯一创造性因素。总之，变异必须是丰富的、程度较小的和无方向的。非达尔文的进化理论通过否定这些中心假设之一或多个来进行分类。

COPIOUS. Since natural selection makes nothing and can only work with raw material presented to its stringent review, variation must be generated in copious and dependable amounts (especially given the hecatomb of selec­tive deaths accompanying the establishment of each favorable feature). Dar­win's scenario for selective modification always includes the postulate, usu­ally stated explicitly, that all structures vary, and can therefore evolve. He argues, for example, that if a short beak were favored on a full-grown pigeon "for the bird's own advantage" (p. 87), then selection would also work within the egg for sufficient beak strength to break the shell despite diminu­tion in overall size of the beak — unless evolution followed an alternate route of selection for thinner shells, "the thickness of the shell being known to vary like any other structure" (p. 87).

COPIOUS。由于自然选择并不创造新事物，它只能利用其严格审查的现有原材料，因此变异必须以丰富而可靠的数量产生，这尤其重要，因为每个有利特征的形成都伴随着大量的选择性死亡。达尔文在描述选择性变异时，总是设定一个假设，通常明确说明，即所有结构都会发生变异，因此可以进化。例如，他指出，如果成年鸽子「为自身利益」而需要短喙（第 87 页），那么选择也会在胚胎期发生，以确保喙的足够强度来破壳而出，尽管喙的整体尺寸可能缩小 —— 除非进化选择了更薄的蛋壳，「因为已知蛋壳的厚度和其他结构一样会变异」（第 87 页）。

Darwin's faith in the copiousness of variation can be gauged most clearly by his response to the two most serious potential challenges of his time. First, he acknowledges the folk wisdom that some domestic species (dogs, for ex­ample) have developed great variety, while others (cats, for example) differ far less among populations. If these universally recognized distinctions arise as consequences of differences in the intrinsic capacity of species to vary, then Darwin's key postulate of copiousness would be compromised — for failure of sufficient raw material would then be setting a primary limit upon the rate and style of evolutionary change, and selection would not occupy the driver's seat.

达尔文对变异丰富性充满信心，这可以从他对当时两个重大挑战的应对中得到体现。首先，他承认一种普遍的观点：一些家养物种（如狗）表现出极大的多样性，而另一些物种（如猫）在种群间的差异较小。如果这些广为接受的区别是由于物种自身变异能力的不同而产生的，那么达尔文关于丰富性的核心假设就会受到影响 —— 因为如果缺乏足够的变异「原材料」，就会限制进化变化的速度和方式，选择也无法主导进化过程。

Darwin responds by denying this interpretation, and arguing that differing intensities of selection, rather than intrinsically distinct capacities for varia­tion, generally cause the greater or lesser differentiation observed among do­mestic species. I regard this argument as among the most forced and uncom­fortable in the Origin — a rare example of Darwinian special pleading. But Darwin realizes the centrality of copiousness to his argument for the creativ­ity of natural selection, and he must therefore face the issue directly:

达尔文通过否认这种解释来回应，他认为通常是选择强度的不同，而不是物种内在的变异能力差异，导致了家养物种之间出现的更显著或更细微的差异。在我看来，这个论点是《物种起源》中最为牵强和不自然的论述之一，属于达尔文少见的特殊辩解。但达尔文意识到，对于他关于自然选择创造性的论证而言，多样性是核心，因此他必须直接面对这个问题：

Although I do not doubt that some domestic animals vary less than oth­ers, yet the rarity or absence of distinct breeds of the cat, the donkey, peacock, goose, etc., may be attributed in main part to selection not hav­ing been brought into play: in cats, from the difficulty in pairing them; in donkeys, from only a few being kept by poor people and little attention paid to their breeding; in peacocks, from not being very easily reared and a large stock not kept; in geese, from being valuable only for two pur­poses, food and feathers, and more especially from no pleasure having been felt in the display of distinct breeds (p. 42).

虽然我相信某些家养动物的变异程度较低，但猫、驴、孔雀、鹅等明显品种的稀少或缺乏，主要是因为选择育种没有得到充分应用：对于猫来说，这是因为它们难以配对；对于驴来说，是因为只有少数由贫穷的人饲养，很少关注其繁殖；对于孔雀来说，由于它们不易饲养，存量不多；而对于鹅来说，因为它们主要用于食物和羽毛，而且人们对展示不同品种没有兴趣（第 42 页）。

Second, copiousness must also be asserted in the face of a powerful argu­ment about limits to variation following modal departure from "type." To use Fleeming Jenkin's (1867) famous analogy: a species may be compared to a rigid sphere, with modal morphology of individuals at the center, and limits to variation defined by the surface. So long as individuals lie near the center, variation will be copious in all directions. But if selection brings the mode to the surface, then further variation in the same direction will cease — and evo­lution will be stymied by an intrinsic limitation upon raw material, even when selection would favor further movement. Evolution, in other words, might consume its own fuel and bring itself to an eventual halt thereby. This potential refutation stood out as especially serious — not only for threaten­ing the creativity of natural selection, but also for challenging the validity of uniformitarian extrapolation as a methodology of research. Darwin re­sponded, as required by logical necessity, that such limits do not exist, and that new spheres of equal radius can be reconstituted around new modes: "No case is on record of a variable being ceasing to be variable under cultiva­tion. Our oldest cultivated plants, such as wheat, still often yield new varie­ties: our oldest domesticated animals are still capable of rapid improvement or modification" (p. 8).

其次，我们需要在讨论偏离「类型」模式后变异限制的问题时，强调变异的丰富性。Fleeming Jenkin（1867）提出了一个著名的类比：一个物种可以被看作一个刚性球体，个体的典型形态位于中心，变异的限制则由球体表面定义。只要个体位于中心附近，变异就可以向各个方向丰富地展开。但如果自然选择将模式推至表面，那么在同一方向上就无法再发生变异 —— 即使自然选择倾向于这种变化，进化也会因为原始材料的内在限制而受到阻碍。换句话说，进化可能会耗尽其「燃料」，最终停滞不前。这一潜在的反驳尤其严重，因为它不仅威胁到自然选择的创造力，还挑战了均变推断作为研究方法的有效性。达尔文对此作出逻辑上的回应，认为这样的限制并不存在，并且可以围绕新的模式重建具有相同半径的新球体：「没有任何一个变异性事物在栽培下停止变化的记录。我们最古老的栽培植物，如小麦，仍然经常产生新品种；我们最古老的驯化动物仍能快速改良或变异。」（第 8 页）。

I cannot here provide a full history for the subsequent odysseys of these key Darwinian precepts. But a few cursory comments indicate how these claims have remained central and contentious throughout the history of post-Dar­winian thought, and how they continue to underlie important debates within Darwinism today.

我无法在这里详细描述这些关键达尔文理论的后续发展历程。但简单评论一下，可以看出这些理论在后达尔文时代的思想史中一直是核心和争议的焦点，并且直到今天，它们仍然是达尔文主义内部重要辩论的基础。

The argument about copiousness, particularly as expressed in the claim for limits to further variability after intense selection, dogged the 19th century literature and emerged as a key issue in the biometrician vs. Mendelian debates early in our century (see Provine, 1971). Castle (1916,1919) pursued his famous experiments on selection in hooded rats in order to test the hy­pothesis of limits imposed by variability upon continued change. One of the most appealing features of Mendelism — and a strong reason for accep­tance following its "rediscovery" in 1900 — lay in the argument that mutation could restore variation "used up" by selection. Nor has the issue abated today. In another form, copiousness underlay the great debate between Dobzhansky and Muller (see Lewontin, 1974) — the classical vs. the balance view in Dobzhansky's terminology. Kimura's (1963, 1983) modern theory of neutralism may be invoked to acknowledge the fact of copiousness while avoiding the pitfalls of genetic load — and therefore becomes "neoclassical" in Lewontin's terminology.

关于变异丰富性的争论，尤其是关于在强烈选择之后变异是否仍会继续增加的争议，在 19 世纪的文献中屡见不鲜，并成为 20 世纪初生物统计学派与孟德尔学派之间讨论的核心问题之一（参见 Provine，1971）。Castle 在 1916 年和 1919 年进行了著名的兜帽大鼠选择实验，旨在验证变异是否会限制持续变化。孟德尔主义吸引人的一个重要特点，以及其在 1900 年被「再发现」后广泛接受的原因，是它主张突变能恢复选择过程中「耗尽」的变异。这一问题至今仍未完全解决。以另一种形式，变异丰富性成为 Dobzhansky 和 Muller 之间大辩论的基础（参见 Lewontin，1974），即在 Dobzhansky 的术语中，经典观点与平衡观点的争论。Kimura（1963，1983）的现代中性论理论承认变异丰富性的存在，同时避免了遗传负担的问题，因此在 Lewontin 的术语中被称为「新经典」。

SMALL IN EXTENT. If the variations that yielded evolutionary change were large — producing new major features, or even new taxa in a single step — then natural selection would not disappear as an evolutionary force. Selection would still function in an auxiliary and negative role as headsman — to heap up the hecatomb of the unfit, permit the new saltation to spread among or­ganisms in subsequent generations, and eventually to take over the popula­tion. But Darwinism, as a theory of evolutionary change, would perish — for selection would become both subsidiary and negative, and variation itself would emerge as the primary, and truly creative, force of evolution, the source of occasionally lucky saltation. For this reason, and quite properly, saltationist (or macromutational) theories have always been viewed as anti-Darwinian — despite the protestations of de Vries (see Chapter 5), who tried to retain the Darwinian label for his continued support of selection as a nega­tive force. The unthinking, knee-jerk response of many orthodox Darwinians whenever they hear the word "rapid" or the name "Goldschmidt," testifies to the conceptual power of saltation as a cardinal danger to an entire theoretical edifice.

如果导致进化变化的变异幅度很大 —— 比如在一步中产生新的主要特征，甚至新的分类群 —— 那么自然选择作为进化力量并不会消失。选择仍会扮演辅助和消极的角色，淘汰不适应的个体，允许新的突变在后代中扩散，最终主导整个种群。然而，作为进化变化理论的达尔文主义会失去其地位 —— 因为选择变得次要且消极，变异本身成了进化的主要力量和真正的创造力源泉，是偶尔成功突变的来源。因此，跳跃论（或大突变论）理论一直被视为反达尔文主义的 —— 尽管 de Vries 试图通过继续支持选择作为消极力量来保留达尔文主义标签（见第五章）。许多正统达尔文主义者对「快速」或「Goldschmidt」的条件反射式反应，表明了突变概念对整个理论体系的巨大威胁。

Darwin held firmly to the credo of small-scale variability as raw material because both poles of his great accomplishment required this proviso. At the methodological pole of using the present and palpable as a basis, by extrapo­lation, for all evolution, Darwin longed to locate the source of all change in the most ordinary and pervasive phenomenon of small-scale variation among members of a population — Lyell's fundamental uniformitarian principle, re­cast for biology, that all scales of history must be explained by currently ob­servable causes acting within their current ranges of magnitude and intensity. "I believe mere individual differences suffice for the work," Darwin writes (p. 102). At the theoretical pole, natural selection can only operate in a cre­ative manner if its cumulating force builds adaptation step by step from an isotropic pool of small-scale variability. If the primary source of evolutionary innovation must be sought in the occasional luck of fortuitous saltations, then internal forces of variation become the creative agents of change, and natural selection can only help to eliminate the unfit after the fit arise by some other process. Darwin, again using domestication as an analog, passionately defends the central role of variation so small as to pass beneath nearly every­one's notice (p. 32):

达尔文坚定地认为，小尺度变异是进化的原材料，因为他的伟大成就的两个方面都需要这一前提。在方法论方面，他利用当前和明显的事物为基础，通过外推来解释所有进化，达尔文希望在种群成员中最普通和普遍的小尺度变异现象中找到所有变化的来源。这是莱尔的基本均变原理在生物学中的应用，即所有历史的规模都必须由当前可观察的原因在其当前的规模和强度范围内进行解释。达尔文写道：「我相信，仅仅是个体差异就足以完成这项工作」（第 102 页）。在理论方面，自然选择只有在其累积力量从均匀分布的变异池中逐步构建适应时，才能以创造性的方式运作。如果进化创新的主要来源必须在偶然的有利突变中寻找，变异的内部力量就成为变化的创造性因素，自然选择只能在适者通过其他过程出现之后帮助消除不适者。达尔文再次使用驯化作为类比，热情地捍卫了小到几乎不被人注意的变异的中心作用（第 32 页）：

If selection consisted merely in separating some very distinct variety, and breeding from it, the principle would be so obvious as hardly to be worth notice; but its importance consists in the great effect produced by the ac­cumulation in one direction, during successive generations, of differ­ences absolutely inappreciable by an uneducated eye — differences which I for one have vainly attempted to appreciate. Not one man in a thou­sand has accuracy of eye and judgment sufficient to become an eminent breeder. If gifted with these qualities, and he studies his subject for years, and devotes his lifetime to it with indomitable perseverance, he will suc­ceed, and may make great improvements; if he wants [that is, lacks] any of these qualities, he will assuredly fail.

如果选择仅仅是挑选出一些明显不同的变种进行繁殖，这个原理就显得微不足道了。然而，它的重要性在于，经过多代的积累，即便是训练有素的人都难以察觉的细微差异能产生巨大影响 —— 这些差异我个人也未能成功理解。能成为杰出育种者的人凤毛麟角，因为需要极高的观察力和判断力。如果一个人具备这些素质，并且多年专注于研究这个领域，用毕生的精力和不懈的努力去追求，他就能取得成功，并可能带来重大改进；反之，如果缺乏任何一项素质，就注定会失败。

Saltational variation has always served as a rallying point for non-Darwin­ian evolutionary argument (see Chapters 4 and 5 for a full discussion). T. H. Huxley centered his own doubts about natural selection firmly upon Dar­win's preference for change by insensible steps. Bateson (1894), in developing the concept of homeosis, and D'Arcy Thompson (1917), in his ideas on non-continuity in certain geometrical transformations, advanced saltation as an explicitly anti-Darwinian argument. The early mutationists read Mendel as a warrant for discontinuous change, and a disproof of strict Darwinism as es­poused by the "biometricians." Goldschmidt (1940; see Gould, 1982a) joined some interesting views on developmental discontinuity to an untenable genetic theory, all the better to espouse a saltationist view that made him the chief whipping boy of the Modern Synthesis.

跳跃性变异一直是反对达尔文进化论的一个重要论点（详见第 4 章和第 5 章）。T. H. Huxley 对自然选择的质疑主要集中在达尔文倾向于渐进变化这一点上。Bateson（1894）在发展同源变异概念时，以及 D'Arcy Thompson（1917）在讨论某些几何变换的不连续性时，提出了跳跃性变异作为反对达尔文的论据。早期的突变论者将孟德尔的理论视为不连续变化的支持，并反驳「生物计量学派」所倡导的严格达尔文主义。Goldschmidt（1940；见 Gould，1982a）将一些有趣的发展不连续性观点与一种不太被接受的遗传理论结合起来，支持跳跃论观点，这使他成为现代综合学派批评的主要对象。

Reciprocally, Darwinians countered with strong and explicit support. R. A. Fisher began his great book (1930) by rooting a defense of Darwin in a link­age of copiousness with small-scale variation — specifically, by arguing for an inverse correlation of frequency and effect, and then claiming that varia­tions of large effect therefore become too rare to serve as evolution's raw material.

作为回应，达尔文主义者给予了强有力且明确的支持。R. A. Fisher 在他 1930 年的重要著作中，通过将丰富性与小规模变异联系起来，为达尔文的理论进行辩护。他具体指出，频率与效应成反比，并声称大效应的变异过于稀少，因此无法成为进化的原材料。

UNDIRECTED. Textbooks of evolution still often refer to variation as "ran­dom." We all recognize this designation as a misnomer, but continue to use the phrase by force of habit. Darwinians have never argued for "random" mutation in the restricted and technical sense of "equally likely in all direc­tions," as in tossing a die. But our sloppy use of "random" (see Eble, 1999) does capture, at least in a vernacular sense, the essence of the important claim that we do wish to convey — namely, that variation must be unrelated to the direction of evolutionary change; or, more strongly, that nothing about the process of creating raw material biases the pathway of subsequent change in adaptive directions. This fundamental postulate gives Darwinism its "two step" character, the "chance" and "necessity" of Monod's famous formula­tion — the separation of a source of raw material (mutation, recombination, etc.) from a force of change (natural selection).

进化教科书中经常将变异描述为「随机」。虽然我们都知道这个说法不太准确，但出于习惯仍然使用它。达尔文主义者并没有在严格意义上将「随机」突变理解为「各个方向上同等可能」，就像掷骰子一样。然而，我们随意使用「随机」这个词（参见 Eble，1999），至少在通俗意义上捕捉到了一个重要观点：变异与进化方向无关。更进一步地说，生成变异的过程并不会偏向适应性变化的方向。这一基本假设赋予了达尔文主义「双重步骤」的特征，即 Monod 著名公式中的「偶然性」和「必然性」，即将变异等原材料的来源与自然选择等变化的力量分开。

In a sense, the specter of directed variability threatens Darwinism even more seriously than any putative failure of the other two postulates. Insuf­ficient variation stalls natural selection; saltation deprives selection of a cre­ative role but still calls upon Darwin's mechanism as a negative force. With directed variation, however, natural selection can be bypassed entirely. If adaptive pressures automatically trigger heritable variation in favored direc­tions, then trends can proceed under regimes of random mortality; natural se­lection, acting as a negative force, can, at most, accelerate the change.

从某种意义上来说，定向变异的概念对达尔文主义的威胁甚至比其他两个假设可能出现的失败更为严重。变异不足会使自然选择停滞；突变虽然剥夺了选择的创造性作用，但仍需要达尔文的机制作为一种制约力量。然而，定向变异可能使自然选择完全失去作用。如果适应性压力能够自动诱导基因在有利的方向上发生遗传变异，那么即便在随机死亡的情况下，进化趋势也能继续进行；自然选择作为一种制约力量，最多只能加速这一变化。

Lamarckism (defined in the modern sense of "soft" heredity) represents the quintessential theory of directed variability. Variation arises with intrinsic bias in adaptive directions either because organisms respond creatively to "felt needs" and pass acquired features directly to their offspring, or because environments induce heritable variation along favored pathways. Other di­rectional theories differ in viewing intrinsic variation as unrelated to adap­tation, but still capable of overwhelming any counteracting selection, and therefore setting the path of evolutionary change. Historically important the­ories in this mode include various notions of orthogenesis that postulate the inevitable origin of hypertrophied and inadaptive structures; and theories of "racial life cycles" that envision an ineluctably aging protoplasm doomed to extinction despite any effort at "rejuvenation" by natural selection. (I shall discuss such ideas in Chapter 5.)

拉马克主义（在现代意义上称为「软」遗传）是关于定向变异的典型理论。这种理论认为，变异会在适应性方向上产生内在的偏向。原因可能是生物体对「感受到的需求」作出创造性的应对，并将获取的特征直接传递给后代，或者是由于环境促使变异沿着某些有利的方向发生。其他定向变异理论的不同之处在于，它们将这种内在变异视为与适应无关，但仍然能够影响进化的方向，从而盖过任何相反的选择压力。在历史上，这种模式下的重要理论包括一些正向演化的观点，这些观点认为会不可避免地出现过度发育和不适应的结构；还有「种族生命周期」理论，认为一种生命体的原生质会不可避免地老化并走向灭绝，即便自然选择试图通过「复兴」来阻止这一过程。（我将在第 5 章中讨论这些想法。）

Darwin clearly understood the threat of directed variability to his cardi­nal postulate of creativity for natural selection. He explicitly restricted the sources of variation to auxiliary roles as providers of raw material, and granted all power over the direction of evolutionary change to natural selec­tion. Drawing his customary analogy to artificial selection, Darwin writes (p. 30): "The key is man's power of accumulative selection: nature gives suc­cessive variations; man adds them up in certain directions useful to him. In this sense he may be said to make for himself useful breeds."

达尔文清楚地意识到，定向变异可能会威胁到他关于自然选择创造力的核心假设。因此，他明确将变异的来源视为一种辅助作用，即提供原材料的角色，而将进化变化的方向完全交给自然选择主导。达尔文通过类比人工选择来解释这一点（第 30 页）：「关键在于人类能够进行累积选择：大自然提供连续的变异，而人类将这些变异累积到对自己有用的方向上。这样看来，人类似乎是在为自己培育出有用的品种。」

Darwin also understood that variation could not be construed as truly ran­dom in the mathematical sense — and that history did not imply or require this strict form of randomness. He recognized biased tendencies to certain states of variation, particularly reversions toward ancestral features. But he viewed such tendencies as weak and easily overcome by selection. Thus, by the proper criterion of relative power and frequency, selection controls the di­rection of change: "When under nature the conditions of life do change, vari­ations and reversions of character probably do occur; but natural selection, as will hereafter be explained, will determine how far the new characters thus arising shall be preserved" (p. 15).

达尔文也意识到，变异不能被认为是完全随机的，历史并不需要这种严格的随机性。他注意到某些变异状态有偏向性，尤其是向祖先特征的回归。但他认为这些倾向很弱，很容易被自然选择所克服。因此，通过相对力量和频率的标准，自然选择控制着变化的方向：「在自然界中，当生存条件发生变化时，变异和性状的回归可能会发生；但如后文所述，自然选择将决定新特征在多大程度上被保留」（第 15 页）。

We may summarize Darwin's third requirement for variation under the ru­bric of isotropy, a common term in mineralogy (and other sciences) for the concept of a structure or system that exhibits no preferred pathway as a con­sequence of construction with equal properties in all directions. Darwinian variation must be copious in amount, small in extent, and effectively isotropic. (Think again of a dynamic sphere, with all radii accessible. The modal form lies at the center and may move by selection along any radius. At any new location, a sphere of comparable size may be reconstituted about the altered modal form.) Only under these stringent conditions can natural selec­tion — a force that makes nothing directly, and must rely upon variation for all raw material — be legitimately regarded as creative.

我们可以将达尔文对变异的第三个要求概括为「各向同性」。这一术语常用于矿物学及其他科学领域，指的是在结构或系统中，由于各个方向上性质相同，因此没有特定的优先方向。达尔文认为，变异必须在数量上丰富、在变化幅度上细微，并且在方向上没有偏向。（可以把它想象成一个动态的球体，所有的半径都是可以通达的。中心的模式可以通过选择沿任意半径移动。每到一个新位置，可以围绕新的模式重新形成一个大小相当的球体。）只有在这些严格的条件下，自然选择 —— 一种本身不直接创造任何事物，而是依赖变异提供所有原材料的力量 —— 才能被视为具有创造力的。

Gradualism

Darwinism, like most comprehensive and complex concepts, defies easy definition. Darwinism cannot be analogized to an object, like the Parthenon, with a clear criterion of membership for each potential slab (whether now resident in the British Museum or in Athens). Moreover, the various proposi­tions of Darwinism cannot be regarded as either independent or of equal force. Darwinism cannot be construed as a deductive system, with some de­fining axioms and a set of logical entailments tied together like a classical proof in plane geometry. But neither can Darwinism be viewed as a set of sep­arate stones, all of similar size, and each ejectable from a bag without great disturbance to the others.

渐进主义达尔文主义，就像许多复杂而全面的概念一样，难以用简单的语言定义。它不像帕台农神庙那样，可以通过明确的标准来判断每个部分是否属于它（不论这些石板现在是在大英博物馆还是在雅典）。此外，达尔文主义中各个命题既不是相互独立的，也不具有同等的重要性。我们不能将达尔文主义看作是一个像几何学证明那样，以公理和逻辑推导紧密联系的系统。但同样，它也不是一堆独立的石块，可以随意移除而不影响整体。

As discussed at length in Chapter 1 (pp. 12–24), I view the conceptual structure of Darwinism much like the metaphor that Darwin himself first used (see Barrett et al., 1987) for depicting evolution (in the "B Notebook" on transmutation kept during the 1830's) — the "coral of life" (later super­seded, in Chapter 4 of the Origin, and in other writings, by the tree of life). The central trunk (the theory of natural selection) cannot be severed, or the creature dies (see Fig. 1-4, p. 18). The first-order branches are also so funda­mental that any severing of a complete branch converts the theory into some­thing essentially different that must be newly named. (I have suggested that the theory of natural selection includes three major branches, discussed in sections B-D of this subchapter.) Each major branch then divides into smaller sub-branches. (In the present section C, I argue that the second major branch, the claim for "creativity of natural selection," divides into three important sub-branches of "requirements for variation," "gradualism," and "the adaptationist program.")

正如在第一章中详细阐述的，我认为达尔文主义的概念结构可以用达尔文本人最初用来描述进化的隐喻来理解（见 Barrett 等人，1987），即「生命的珊瑚」。这种隐喻在 1830 年代的「B 笔记本」中关于变异记录时首次出现，后来在《物种起源》第四章及其他著作中被「生命之树」所替代。中央的主干（自然选择理论）是不可或缺的，一旦被切断，整个生物系统便不复存在（见图 1-4，第 18 页）。第一阶的分支同样重要，若完整分支被切断，理论就会变得与原本截然不同，需要重新命名。（我提出自然选择理论包含三个主要分支，这将在本小节的 B-D 部分讨论。）每个主要分支又进一步分为更小的子分支。（在本节 C 中，我认为第二个主要分支，即「自然选择的创造力」这一主张，可以分为三个重要的子分支：「变异的要求」、「渐进主义」和「适应主义计划」。）

As further argued in Chapter 1, this model allows us to address the impor­tant question of dispensability. At some level above the base, we may excise a sub branch, deny its premises, and still consider ourselves Darwinians. I envi­sion the central trunk and first-order branches as indispensable. Along the continuum from necessary to avoidable, we may begin to make selective ne­gations at the level of sub-branches, but not without severe stress to the entire structure. Thus, T. H. Huxley could oppose gradualism and still consider himself a supporter of natural selection (though his approbation remained ambiguous and indifferent at best, and his role as "Darwin's bulldog" rested upon his defense of evolution itself, not his explication of natural selection). And a modern developmental saltationist might call himself a Darwinian, though not without an array of "buts" and qualifications.

正如第 1 章中进一步讨论的那样，这个模型帮助我们解决一个关键问题：什么是必须的，什么是可有可无的。在基本理论之上，我们可以去掉某个子分支，否定它的前提，同时仍然认为自己是达尔文主义者。我认为中央主干和主要分支是必不可少的。在从必需到可避免的连续过程中，我们可以对某些子分支进行选择性的否定，但这可能会对整体结构造成重大影响。因此，T. H. Huxley 可以反对渐变论，同时仍然认为自己支持自然选择（尽管他对自然选择的支持态度相对模糊和冷淡，他作为「达尔文的斗犬」是因为他捍卫了进化论本身，而不是详细解释自然选择）。一位现代的发育突变论者可能也会称自己为达尔文主义者，尽管这会带有很多「但是」和附加条件。

One other feature of the model requires explicit commentary. I have chosen a coral in preference to the more conventional tree, because the branches of many corals form a network by lateral anastomoses (while each limb of a tree stands free, and may be chopped off without necessarily affecting the others). The premises of Darwin's theory (the branches and sub-branches of the coral model) are organically connected. One might be able to excise a single branch without killing the others, but some pain and readjustment will certainly be felt throughout the entire structure. The three sub-branches of the "creativ­ity" limb, for example, are strongly conjoined in this manner. If variation forms an isotropic sphere (the expectation of sub-branch one), then change by natural selection can only occur a short step at a time (as predicted by the gradualism of sub-branch two). And if variation imposes no constraint upon the direction of change (an inference from isotropy), then natural selection works freely and adaptation prevails (as required by sub-branch three).

模型的一个特征需要特别说明。我选择使用珊瑚而不是常见的树，因为许多珊瑚的分支通过侧向连接形成网络（而树的每个枝干都是独立的，可以砍掉一个而不一定影响其他部分）。达尔文理论的前提（珊瑚模型的分支和子分支）是有机相连的。虽然可以切除一个枝干而不至于影响其他部分的生存，但整个结构一定会受到影响。例如，「创造力」这一枝干的三个子分支就是这样紧密相连的。如果变异形成一个各向同性的球体（子分支一的预期），那么自然选择引起的变化只能逐步发生（正如子分支二的渐进主义所预测）。如果变异对变化方向没有限制（从各向同性推断），那么自然选择可以自由进行，适应性得以保持（如子分支三所要求）。

Finally, as so often emphasized throughout this book, we must recognize and embrace natural history as a science of relative frequencies. None of these basic Darwinian premises operates without exception throughout na­ture. Darwin insisted* — explicitly and vociferously — that natural selection only enjoyed a predominant relative frequency, not exclusivity: "the main but not exclusive means of modification," as he writes at the close of the in­troduction (p. 6). Darwin then extended his claim for a predominant relative frequency, but not for exclusivity, to all other sub-branches of his essential argument as well. Failure of raw material might occasionally explain a puz­zling absence of evolutionary modification — but lack of selective pressure for change surely represents the more likely explanation for stasis by far. Sub­stantial change might occur as a very rare event, but most alteration must be insensible, even on geological scales: "We see nothing of these slow changes in progress, until the hand of time has marked the long lapse of ages" (p. 84).

最后，正如本书多次强调的，我们必须把自然历史视为一门研究相对频率的科学。在自然界中，没有一个达尔文提出的基本前提是毫无例外地适用的。达尔文明确指出，自然选择只是占据了主要相对频率，并非唯一的机制：「主要但不是唯一的变异手段，」正如他在导言结尾所写（第 6 页）。达尔文接着把这个关于相对频率的观点扩展到他论点的所有其他方面。有时，材料的不足可能解释为何进化变异会神秘地缺失，但更可能的解释是缺乏变异的选择压力。实质性的变化可能极为罕见，但大多数变化即使在地质时间尺度上也难以察觉：「我们看不到这些缓慢变化的进行，直到漫长岁月过去」（第 84 页）。

Understanding Darwin's mode of justification by relative frequency becomes vitally important because selective quotation represents the most com­mon error made by evolutionists in interpreting his work and theory. The Or­igin, as a volume of single authorship, maintains a stronger plot line and features fewer inconsistencies than the Bible; but Darwin and the Good Lord do share the common trait of saying something about nearly everything. Wrenched from context and divorced from a crucial assessment by relative frequency, a Darwinian statement can be found to support almost any posi­tion, even the most un-Darwinian.

理解达尔文通过相对频率进行论证的方式是至关重要的，因为进化论者在解释达尔文的工作和理论时，最常见的错误是选择性引用。《物种起源》作为一本由达尔文独立撰写的著作，保持了更清晰的情节线索，并且不一致之处比《圣经》更少；但达尔文和上帝都有一个共同的特征，就是几乎对所有事情都有所评论。如果脱离上下文，并不进行相对频率的关键评估，达尔文的某些论述可能被用来支持几乎任何立场，甚至是与达尔文观点相悖的立场。

Since Darwin prevails as the patron saint of our profession, and since everyone wants such a preeminent authority on his side, a lamentable tradition has arisen for appropriating single Darwinian statements as defenses for par­ticular views that either bear no relation to Darwin's own concerns, or that even confute the general tenor of his work. Thus, for example, Darwin wrote extensively about variational constraint, and he maintained great interest in this topic (see Chapter 4). But the logic of his work entails adaptive control of evolutionary change and isotropy of variation as generally prevalent — and Darwin ultimately comes down (as he must) on the side of these necessary un­derpinnings for natural selection. Proper textual analysis requires that gen­eral tenor, not selective statement, be presented. Two basic procedural modes, each with distinctive criteria, set the framework for such textual analysis. The empirical mode makes its judgments of importance by relative frequency and interconnectedness of statements. Meanwhile, and simultaneously, the logical mode employs theoretical consistency as an arbiter for judging the validity and power of the structure of argument. We revere Darwin because he unfail­ingly manifested the two key traits of brilliance and honesty. He knew where his arguments led, and he followed them relentlessly, however unpleasant the consequences. We do him the greatest possible disservice when we approach his work as a superficial grazer, searching for some particular item of per­sonal sustenance, while ignoring the beauty and power of general tenor and logical entailment.

作为我们领域的标志性人物，达尔文常被引用来支持各种观点。然而，这种引用有时与达尔文本人的关注点无关，甚至与他的整体思想相悖。例如，尽管达尔文在其著作中深入探讨了变异的限制，并对此有着极大的兴趣（见第 4 章），但他的研究逻辑强调了进化变异的适应性控制和变异的各向同性的重要性。达尔文最终支持这些作为自然选择的必要基础。正确的文本分析应呈现整体思想，而非片面摘录。文本分析有两种基本方法，各自有其独特标准。实证方法根据陈述的相对频率和相互关联性来判断重要性。同时，逻辑方法则以理论一致性来评估论证结构的有效性和力量。我们敬仰达尔文，是因为他总是展现出卓越的智慧和诚实的品质。他清楚自己的论点指向何方，并始终坚持，即使后果令人不快。如果我们只从他的作品中寻找个人支持，而忽视其整体思想和逻辑推演的美妙与力量，那将是对他极大的不尊重。

I raise this point here because abuse of selective quotation has been particularly notable in discussions of Darwin's views on gradualism. Of course Dar­win acknowledged great variation in rates of change, and even episodes of rapidity that might be labelled catastrophic (at least on a local scale); for how could such an excellent naturalist deny nature's multifariousness on such a key issue as the character of change itself? But these occasional statements do not make Darwin the godfather of punctuated equilibrium, or a cryptic sup­porter of saltation (as de Vries actually claimed, thus earning a unique and of­ficial rebuke from the organizers of the Darwinian centenary celebration at Cambridge — see p. 416).

我之所以在此提出这个问题，是因为在讨论达尔文关于渐变论的看法时，选择性引用的问题尤其明显。当然，达尔文承认变化的速度可能有很大差异，甚至可能出现某些速度极快的变化，被称为灾难性变化（至少在局部区域是这样）；毕竟，作为一位杰出的博物学家，他不可能在变化本质这样重要的问题上否认自然的多样性。然而，这些偶尔的表述并不意味着达尔文是间断平衡理论的倡导者，或是跳跃进化论的秘密支持者（正如 de Vries 所声称的那样，这一说法在剑桥达尔文百年庆典上遭到了组织者的正式谴责 —— 参见第 416 页）。

Gradualism may represent the most central conviction residing both within and behind all Darwin's thought. Gradualism far antedates natural selection among his guiding concerns, and casts a far wider net over his choice of subjects for study. Gradualism sets the explanatory framework for his first substantive book on coral reefs (1842) and for his last on the formation of to­pography and topsoil by earthworms (1881) — two works largely devoid of reference to natural selection. Gradualism had been equated with rationality itself by Darwin's chief guru, Charles Lyell (see Chapter 6). All scholars have noted the centrality of gradualism, both in the ontogeny (Gruber and Barrett, 1974) and logic (Mayr, 1991) of Darwin's thought.

渐进主义可能是达尔文思想中最核心的信念，无论是在其思想体系内部还是背后。相比自然选择，渐进主义在达尔文关注的指导原则中出现得更早，并对他选择研究的主题产生了更广泛的影响。渐进主义为他关于珊瑚礁的第一本重要著作（1842 年）和他关于蚯蚓如何形成地形和表土的最后一本著作（1881 年）提供了解释框架，而这两本书几乎没有提到自然选择。达尔文的主要导师查尔斯·莱尔（详见第 6 章）甚至将渐进主义视作理性本身。所有学者都注意到了渐进主义在达尔文思想的形成和逻辑中的核心地位（Gruber 和 Barrett，1974；Mayr，1991）。

I will not play "duelling quotations" with "citation grazers," though a full tabulation of relative frequencies could easily bury their claims under a mountain of statements. For the present assessment of branch two ("creativ­ity of natural selection") on the coral of essential Darwinian logic, the neces­sity of gradualism will suffice. Selection becomes creative only if it can impart direction to evolution by superintending the slow and steady accumulation of favored subsets from an isotropic pool of variation. If gradualism does not accompany this process of change, selection must relinquish this creative role and Darwinism then fails as a creative source of evolutionary novelty. If im­portant new features, or entire new taxa, arise as large and discontinuous variations, then creativity lies in production of the variation itself. Natural se­lection no longer causes evolution, and can only act as a headsman for the unfit, thus promoting changes that originated in other ways. Gradualism therefore becomes a logical consequence of the operation of natural selection in Darwin's creative mode. Gradualism also pervades the methodological pole of Darwin's greatness because the uniformitarian argument of extrapola­tion will not work unless change at the grandest scale arises by the summa­tion through time of small, immediate, and palpable variations.

我不会与那些喜欢挑剔引用的人进行「引文对决」，虽然完全可以通过整理频率来驳倒他们的观点。在评估达尔文逻辑核心中的第二个分支（即自然选择的创造性）时，强调渐进变化的必要性就足够了。只有当自然选择能够通过从各种变化中缓慢而稳定地筛选出有利的特征，并引导进化方向时，它才真正具有创造性。若没有渐进的过程，自然选择就无法发挥这种创造性的作用，达尔文主义作为进化新特征的创造来源就会失效。如果重要的新特征或新的生物类别是通过大规模且不连续的变化产生的，那么创造性实际上源于变化本身的产生。此时，自然选择不再是进化的推动力，而只是淘汰不适者的「执行者」，促进的是由其他途径产生的变化。因此，渐进变化成为达尔文式自然选择的逻辑结果。渐进主义也体现在达尔文方法论的精妙之处，因为只有当最大尺度的变化通过时间积累小的、明显的变异而产生时，均变论的外推才会奏效。

Gradualism, for Darwin, represents a complex doctrine with several layers of meaning, all interconnected, while remaining independent in some impor­tant senses. I shall consider three increasing levels of specificity, arguing, on the Goldilocks model, that one meaning is too nebulous, another overly wrought, but the third (in the middle) "just right" as the crucial validator of natural selection (whereas the other two meanings play equally crucial roles for other aspects of Darwin's view of life).

对于达尔文来说，渐进主义是一种复杂的学说，它包含多个层次的含义，这些含义相互关联，但在某些重要方面又保持独立。我将探讨三个逐渐增加的具体性层次，并根据「金发姑娘」模型来论证：其中一个含义过于模糊，另一个过于复杂，而第三个居中的含义则「恰到好处」，是自然选择的关键验证者（而另外两个含义在达尔文生命观的其他方面同样发挥着关键作用）。

Historical continuity of stuff and information. At the broadest level, gradualism merely asserts unbroken historical connectedness between putative ancestor and descendant, without characterizing the mode or rate of transition. If new species originate as creations ex nihilo by a divine power, then connectivity fails. The assertion of gradualism in this broadest meaning encapsulates the chief defense for the factuality of evolution. Such a contention could not be more vital to Darwin's revolution of course, but this sense of gradualism only asserts that evolution occurred, while telling us nothing about how evolution happens; the logical tie of gradualism to natural selection cannot reside here.* Thus, this first, or "too big," sense of gradualism validates evolution itself (vs. creationism), but not Darwin's, or anyone else's, proposed mechanism of evolutionary change.

在最广泛的意义上，渐进主义仅仅是指出假定的祖先和后代之间存在不间断的历史连续性，而没有描述转变的模式或速度。如果新物种是由神力无中生有创造的，那这种连续性就不存在。在这个意义上，渐进主义为进化的真实性提供了主要的支持。当然，这对于达尔文的革命至关重要，但在这里，渐进主义只是证明了进化的发生，而没有解释进化的具体过程；在这个层面上，渐进主义与自然选择的逻辑联系并不存在。因此，这种「过于宏大」的渐进主义意义上，验证的是进化本身（相对创造论而言），而不是达尔文或其他人提出的具体演化机制。

Insensibility of intermediacy. We now come to the heart of what natural selection requires. This second, "just right," statement does not ad­vance a claim about how much time a transition must take, or how variable a rate of change might be. The second meaning simply asserts that, in going from A to a substantially different B, evolution must pass through a long and insensible sequence of intermediary steps — in other words, that ancestor and descendant must be linked by a series of changes, each within the range of what natural selection might construct from ordinary variability. Without gradualism in this form, large variations of discontinuous morphological im­port — rather than natural selection — might provide the creative force of evo­lutionary change. But if the tiny increment of each step remains inconsequen­tial in itself, then creativity must reside in the summation of these steps into something substantial — and natural selection, in Darwin's theory, acts as the agent of accumulation.

中间变化的不易察觉性。我们现在讨论自然选择的核心要求。第二种「恰到好处」的说法并没有明确说明过渡需要多长时间，也没有涉及变化速率的多样性。它仅仅指出，从 A 演变到显著不同的 B，必须经历一个漫长且不易察觉的中间步骤序列。换句话说，祖先和后代之间必须通过一系列变化相连，每个变化都在自然选择能够通过普通变异构建的范围内。如果没有这种渐进的过程，那么可能是形态学上的巨大变化，而不是自然选择，成为进化变化的创造力量。然而，如果每一步的微小增量本身并不显著，那么创造力就体现在这些步骤的累积效应中，形成某种实质性的变化。在达尔文的理论中，自然选择是这种累积变化的推动者。

This meaning of gradualism underlies Darwin's frequent invocation of the old Leibnizian and Linnaean aphorism, Natura non facit saltum (nature does not proceed by leaps). Darwin's commitment to this postulate can only strike us as fierce and, by modern standards, overly drawn. Thus, Darwin writes (p. 189): "If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modi­fications, my theory would absolutely break down." And lest we doubt that "my theory" refers specifically to the mechanism of natural selection (and not simply to the assertion of evolution), Darwin often draws an explicit link be­tween selection as a creative force and gradualism as an implied necessity: "Undoubtedly nothing can be effected through Natural Selection except by the addition of infinitesimally small changes; and if it could be shown that... transitional states were impossible, the theory would be overthrown" (in Natural Selection — see Stauffer, 1975, p. 250). And in the concluding chapter of the Origin: "As natural selection acts solely by accumulating slight, succes­sive, favorable variations, it can produce no great or sudden modification; it can act only by very short and slow steps. Hence the canon of 'Natura non facit saltum'... is on this theory simply intelligible" (p. 471).

达尔文频繁引用莱布尼茨和林奈的古老格言「Natura non facit saltum」（自然不会突变），这展示了渐进主义的含义。达尔文对这一假设的坚持在现代标准下显得极为强烈，甚至有些偏执。因此，达尔文在《物种起源》中写道（第 189 页）：「如果可以证明存在某种复杂器官，它不可能通过众多、连续、细微的变化形成，那么我的理论将完全崩溃。」为了让人们明确「我的理论」具体指的是自然选择机制（而不仅仅是进化的观点），达尔文常常明确指出选择作为一种创造性力量与渐进主义之间的必要联系：「毫无疑问，自然选择无法实现任何效果，除非是通过增加极其微小的变化；如果可以证明过渡状态是不可能的，那么理论将被推翻」（在《自然选择》中 —— 参见 Stauffer，1975，第 250 页）。在《物种起源》的结尾章节中，达尔文总结道：「由于自然选择仅仅通过积累细微的、连续的、有利的变化起作用，它无法产生巨大的或突然的变化；它只能通过非常短而缓慢的步骤起作用。因此，‘Natura non facit saltum'的原则在这个理论中是容易理解的」（第 471 页）。

But would the theory of natural selection "absolutely break down" if even a single organ — not to mention an entire organism — could arise by large and discontinuous changes? Does Darwinism truly require the following extreme formulation: "Natural selection can only act by the preservation and accu­mulation of infinitesimally small inherited modifications" (p. 95). At some level of discontinuity, of course, Darwin's strong statement must prevail. If the altered morphology of new species often arose in single steps by fortu­itous macromutation, then selection would lose its creative role and could act only as a secondary and auxiliary force to spread the sudden blessing through a population. But can we justify Darwin's application of the same claim to single organs? Suppose (as must often happen) that developmental heterochrony produces a major shift in form and function by two or three steps without intermediary stages. The size of these steps may lie outside the "normal" variation of most populations at most moments, but not beyond the potential of an inherited developmental program. (Incidentally, these types of changes represent the concept that Goldschmidt embodied in the le­gitimate meaning of "hopeful monster," before he made his unfortunate deci­sion to tie this interesting concept to his fallacious genetics of "systemic mu­tation" — see Chapter 5 and Gould, 1982a.)

但是，如果一个器官（更何况整个生物体）通过大的、不连续的变化而产生，是否会导致自然选择理论彻底崩溃？达尔文主义是否真的需要这样的一种极端表述：「自然选择只能通过保存和积累极为微小的遗传变异来发挥作用」（第 95 页）。当然，在某种不连续性水平上，达尔文的强烈主张必须占主导地位。如果新物种的形态改变经常通过偶发的大突变在单一步骤中出现，那么选择将失去其创造性角色，只能作为次要和辅助力量，来在种群中传播这种突然的变化。但是，我们能否合理地将达尔文的同样主张应用于单个器官呢？假设（这是经常发生的情况）发育异时性通过两到三个步骤无中间阶段地引起形态和功能的重大转变。这些步骤的规模可能超出了大多数种群在大多数时刻的「正常」变异，但并不超出遗传发育程序的潜力。此外，这些类型的变化体现了 Goldschmidt 在「希望的怪物」中的正当概念，这在他将这一有趣概念与其错误的「系统突变」遗传学联系起来之前是成立的 —— 参见第 5 章和 Gould，1982a。

Would natural selection perish if change in this mode were common? I don't think so. Darwinian theory would require some adjustments and com­promises — particularly a toning down of assertions about the isotropy of variation, and a more vigorous study of internal constraint in genetics and de­velopment (see Chapter 10 for advocacy of this theoretical shift) — but natu­ral selection would still enjoy a status far higher than that of a mere execu­tioner. A new organ does not make a new species; and a new morphology must be brought into functional integration — a process that requires second­ary adaptation and fine tuning, presumably by natural selection, whatever the extent of the initial step.

如果这种模式的变化经常发生，自然选择会因此消失吗？我认为不会。达尔文的理论可能需要一些修正和调整 —— 特别是要弱化对变异均匀性的断言，同时更加深入地研究遗传和发育中的内部限制（参见第 10 章对此理论变化的建议）—— 但自然选择的地位仍然远不止是一个简单的执行者。一个新器官的产生不会直接导致新物种的形成；新的形态必须通过功能的整合来实现 —— 无论最初的变化幅度如何，这个过程都需要自然选择来进行进一步的适应和精细调整。

I believe, therefore, that Darwin's strong, even pugnacious, defense of strict gradualism reflects a much more pervasive commitment, extending far be­yond the simple recognition of a logical entailment implied by natural selec­tion — and that this stronger conviction must record such general influences as Darwin's attraction to Lyell's conflation of gradualism with rationality itself, and the cultural appeal of gradualism during Britain's greatest age of indus­trial expansion and imperial conquest (Gould, 1984a). Huxley's savvy assess­ment of the Origin still rings true, for while he offered, in his famous letter to Darwin, written just as the Origin rolled off the presses, to "go to the stake" for Darwin's view, he also stated his major criticism: "You have loaded your­self with an unnecessary difficulty in adopting Natura non facit saltum so un­reservedly" (in L. Huxley, 1901, p. 189).

因此，我认为达尔文对严格渐变论的坚定捍卫不仅仅是出于自然选择逻辑上的必然性，而是反映了一种更广泛的信念。这种信念可能受到多个因素的影响，例如达尔文被莱尔将渐变论等同于理性的观点所吸引，以及在英国快速工业化和帝国扩张时期，渐变论在文化上的吸引力（Gould，1984a）。赫胥黎对《物种起源》的评价至今仍有道理，他在《物种起源》刚出版时写给达尔文的信中表示，愿意为达尔文的观点「赴汤蹈火」，但同时也指出了一个主要批评：「你毫无保留地接受了‘自然不跳跃'这一原则，给自己增加了不必要的难题」（见 L. Huxley，1901，第 189 页）。

Darwin persevered nonetheless. We often fail to recognize how much of the Origin presents an exposition of gradualism, rather than a defense of natural selection. As a striking example, the famous (and virtually only) statement about human evolution asserts the pedagogical value of gradualism — not nat­ural selection — in our Socratic quest to know ourselves: "Psychology will be based on a new foundation, that of the necessary acquirement of each mental power and capacity by gradation. Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history" (p. 488).

尽管如此，达尔文依旧不懈努力。我们常常忽视，《物种起源》里大部分是在阐述渐进主义，而非单纯地为自然选择辩护。一个显著的例子是，关于人类进化的著名（几乎是唯一的）论述，体现了渐进主义在教育上的价值，而不是自然选择。这段论述在我们以苏格拉底式的方式追求自我认识的过程中尤为重要：「心理学将建立在一种新的基础之上，这一基础是通过渐进的方式必要地获得每一种心理能力和才能。这样将揭示人类的起源及其历史」（第 488 页）。

Chapter 9 on geological evidence, where the uninitiated might expect to find a strong defense for evolution from the most direct source of evidence in the fossil record, reads instead as a long (and legitimate) apologia for a threatening discordance between data and logical entailment — a fossil record dominated by gaps and discontinuities when read literally vs. the insensible transitions required by natural selection as a creative agent. Darwin, with his characteristic honesty, states the dilemma baldly in succinct deference to his methodological need for equating temporal steps of change with differences noted among varieties of contemporary species: "By the theory of natural se­lection all living species have been connected with the parent-species of each genus, by differences not greater than we see between the varieties of the same species at the present day" (p. 281).

第九章讲述地质证据。许多初学者可能会期待从化石记录中找到支持进化论的直接证据。然而，这一章更像是对化石记录中数据与逻辑推理不一致的一种解释。这种不一致在于，化石记录往往显示出很多空白和不连贯，而自然选择作为一种创造性机制，需要的是逐渐的变化。达尔文以他特有的诚实，直接指出了这个两难困境。他强调，为了满足他的方法论需求，必须将时间上的变化与当代物种变异的差异等同起来：「根据自然选择理论，所有现生物种都与各属的亲本物种相连，其差异不大于我们今天所见的同种变异的差异」（第 281 页）。

Darwin, as we all know, resolved this discordance by branding the fossil record as so imperfect — like a book with few pages present and only a few let­ters preserved on each page — that truly insensible continuity becomes de­graded to a series of abrupt leaps in surviving evidence:

达尔文，如我们所知，通过将化石记录形容为极其不完整来解决这种不一致。他把化石记录比作一本只有几页的书，而每页上仅保留了几个字母。因此，那些原本难以察觉的连续性在现存的证据中显得像一系列突然的跳跃：

Why then is not every geological formation and every stratum full of such intermediate links? Geology assuredly does not reveal any such finely graduated organic chain; and this, perhaps, is the most obvious and gravest objection which can be urged against my theory. This expla­nation lies, as I believe, in the extreme imperfection of the geological rec­ord (p. 280).

那么，为什么每个地质构造和地层中都没有充满这样的中间环节呢？地质学确实没有揭示出这样的细微分级的有机链条；这可能是对我的理论最明显且最严重的反对意见。我认为，原因在于地质记录极度不完整（第 280 页）。

He, who rejects these views on the nature of the geological record, will rightly reject my whole theory (p. 342).

Slowness and smoothness (but not constancy) of rate. Darwin also championed the most stringent version of gradualism — not mere continuity of information, and not just insensibility of innumerable transi­tional steps; but also the additional claim that change must be insensibly gradual even at the broadest temporal scale of geological durations, and that continuous flux (at variable rates to be sure) represents the usual state of nature.

那些不接受这些关于地质记录本质看法的人，自然也不会赞同我的整个理论（第 342 页）。

变化的缓慢和渐进（但不固定）速率。达尔文提倡的是一种非常严格的渐变理论 —— 不仅强调信息的连续性和无数中间阶段的无感知性，还进一步主张，即使在最长的地质时间跨度中，变化也应该是逐渐发生的。同时，他认为，自然界的常态是持续不断的变化（当然速度是变化的）。

This broadest version of gradualism does not hold strong logical ties to natural selection as an evolutionary mechanism. Change might be episodic and abrupt in geological perspective, but still proceed by insensible intermediacy at a generational perspective — given the crucial scaling principle that thousands of generations make a geological moment. For this reason, Eldredge and I have never viewed punctuated equilibrium, which does refute Darwinian gradualism in this third sense, as an attack on the creativity of nat­ural selection itself (Eldredge and Gould, 1972; Gould and Eldredge, 1977, 1993). The challenge of punctuated equilibrium to natural selection rests upon two entirely different issues of support provided by punctuational ge­ometry for the explanation of cladal trends by differential species success and not by extrapolated anagenesis, and for the high relative frequency of species selection, as opposed to the exclusivity of Darwinian selection on organisms (see Chapters 8 and 9).

渐变论在最广泛的意义上，并未与自然选择这种进化机制形成强有力的逻辑联系。从地质的角度来看，变化可能是阶段性的和突发的，但从几代人的视角来看，变化依然可以通过不易察觉的中间步骤逐步进行 —— 因为有一个重要的比例原则，即数千代构成一个地质瞬间。正因为如此，Eldredge 和我从未将间断平衡视为对自然选择创造力的攻击，尽管它在某种意义上确实反驳了达尔文的渐变论（Eldredge 和 Gould，1972; Gould 和 Eldredge，1977，1993）。间断平衡对自然选择提出挑战的基础在于两个截然不同的问题：一是间断几何学支持通过差异物种成功解释群体趋势，而非通过谱系进化的外推；二是物种选择的高频出现率，而不仅仅限于达尔文所说的个体选择（详见第 8 章和第 9 章）。

Some fidei defensores of the Darwinian citadel have sensed the weakness of this third version of gradualism, and have either pointed out that the creativ­ity of natural selection cannot be compromised thereby (quite correct, but then no one ever raised such a challenge, at least within the legitimate de­bate on punctuated equilibrium); or have argued either that Darwin meant no such thing, or that, if he really did, the claim has no importance (see Dawkins, 1986). This last effort in apologetics provides a striking illustration of the retrospective fallacy in historiography. Whatever the current status of this third formulation within modern Darwinism, this broadest style of grad­ualism was vitally important to Darwin; for belief in slow change in geologi­cal perspective lies at the heart of his more inclusive view about nature and science, an issue even larger than the mechanics of natural selection.

一些支持达尔文主义的坚定拥护者已经意识到第三种渐变论的弱点，他们指出，自然选择的创造性不应因此受到质疑（这一点毫无疑问，但事实上，在关于间断平衡的合理辩论中，从未有人提出这样的挑战）；或者他们主张，达尔文并没有这样的意思，即使他真的这样认为，这种观点也不重要（参见 Dawkins，1986）。这种最后的辩解努力鲜明地展示了历史研究中的一种回溯性错误。不论在现代达尔文主义中这种第三种形式的地位如何，这种最广泛的渐变论对达尔文来说至关重要；因为在地质学视角下对缓慢变化的信仰是他对自然和科学更宏观看法的核心，这个问题甚至比自然选择的具体机制更为重要。

Darwin often states his convictions about extreme slowness and contin­uous flux in geological time — as something quite apart from gradualism's second meaning of insensible intermediacy in microevolutionary perspec­tive. Evolutionary change, Darwin asserts, usually occurs so slowly that even the immense length of an average geological formation may not reach the mean time of transformation between species. Thus, apparent stasis may ac­tually represent change at average rates, but to an imperceptible degree even through such an extensive stretch of geological time! "Although each forma­tion may mark a very long lapse of years, each perhaps is short compared with the period requisite to change one species into another" (p. 293).

达尔文常常强调他对地质时间中极其缓慢和持续变化的看法，这与渐变论在微观进化中不明显变化的解释有所不同。达尔文指出，进化的变化通常是如此缓慢，以至于即使是一个普通地质层的形成时间，也可能不足以完成物种之间的转变。因此，表面上的停滞实际上可能是以平均速率发生的变化，但即便在如此漫长的地质时间中，这种变化仍难以察觉。「尽管每个地质层的形成可能需要很长时间，但与一个物种变为另一个物种所需的时间相比，每个地质层的形成时间可能仍然较短」（第 293 页）。

Change not only occurs with geological slowness on this largest scale; but most transformations also proceed in sufficient continuity and limited varia­tion in rate that elapsed time may be roughly measured by degree of accumu­lated difference: "The amount of organic change in the fossils of consecutive formations probably serves as a fair measure of the lapse of actual time" (p. 488).

不仅仅是在最大尺度上，变化是以地质的缓慢速度发生的；而且大多数变化都在相对稳定和有限的速率变化中进行。因此，我们可以通过观察累积的差异程度来大致估算时间的流逝：「连续地层中化石的有机变化量可能是衡量实际时间流逝的一个合理指标」（第 488 页）。

Darwin presents his credo in crisp epitome: "Nature acts uniformly and slowly during vast periods of time on the whole organization, in any way which may be for each creature's own good" (p. 269). Note how Darwin concentrates so many of his central beliefs into so few words: gradualism, adaptationism, locus of selection on organisms.

达尔文在简要概述中阐述了他的信条：「大自然在漫长的时间里，以对每个生物自身有利的任何方式，缓慢而持续地作用于整个有机体」（第 269 页）。请注意，达尔文用如此简短的文字表达了他的许多核心信念：渐变论、适应论，以及选择作用的重点在于有机体。

But the most striking testimony to Darwin's conviction about gradualism in this third sense of slow and continuous flux lies in several errors promi­nently highlighted in the Origin — all based on convictions about steady rate (gradualism in the third sense), not on the insensible intermediacy genuinely demanded by natural selection (gradualism in the second sense), or on the simple continuity of historical information required to validate the factuality of evolution itself (gradualism in the first sense). For example, Darwin makes a famous calculation (dropped from later editions) on the "denudation of the Weald" — the erosion of the anticlinal valley located between the North and South Chalk Downs of southern England (pp. 285-287). He tries to deter­mine an average value for yearly erosion of seacliffs today, and then extrapo­lates his figure as a constant rate into the past. His date of some 300 million years for the denudation of the Weald overestimated the true duration by five times or more. (The deposition of the Chalk, an Upper Cretaceous formation, persisted nearly to the period's end 65 million years ago.)

达尔文在其关于缓慢和连续变化的渐变论信念上，最引人注目的例证在于《物种起源》中他自己指出的几个显著错误。这些错误基于对稳定速率的信念（渐变论的第三种含义），而非自然选择所需的中间状态的不可感知性（第二种含义），或者是验证进化事实所需的历史信息连续性（第一种含义）。例如，达尔文曾进行过一个著名的计算（在后来的版本中被删除），即「韦尔德的剥蚀」—— 这是一处位于英格兰南部南北白垩丘陵之间的背斜谷的侵蚀。他试图确定当今海岸悬崖的年平均侵蚀率，然后将这个数值作为一个恒定速率推算到过去。他得出韦尔德剥蚀大约经历了 3 亿年，这个时间至少高估了五倍以上。（白垩的沉积，属于上白垩纪 Upper Cretaceous 的地层，几乎持续到 6500 万年前的纪末。）

Moving to a biological example that underscores Darwin's hostility to episodes of "explosive" evolutionary diversification (he used his usual argument about the imperfection of the fossil record to deny their literal appearance and to spread them out in time), Darwin predicted that the Cambrian explo­sion would be exposed as an artifact, and that complex multicellular crea­tures must have thrived for vast Precambrian durations, gradually reaching the complexity of basal Cambrian forms. (When Darwin published in 1859, the Cambrian had not yet been recognized, and his text therefore speaks of the base of the Silurian, meaning lower Cambrian in modern terminology): "If my theory be true, it is indisputable that before the lowest Silurian stra­tum was deposited, long periods elapsed, as long as, or probably far longer than, the whole interval from the Silurian age to the present day; and that during these vast, yet quite unknown periods of time, the world swarmed with living creatures" (p. 307).

在生物学的领域中，有一个例子体现了达尔文对「爆炸性」进化多样化事件的反对态度。他通常会借助化石记录的不完美来否认这些事件的直接出现，并将其分散在更长的时间段上。达尔文曾预测，寒武纪生物大爆发其实是个假象，复杂的多细胞生物在漫长的前寒武纪时期就已繁盛，并逐渐演化到寒武纪基础形态的复杂程度。（在 1859 年达尔文发表作品时，寒武纪尚未被科学界确认，所以他的文字中提到的是志留纪的底部，这在现代术语中指的是下寒武纪）：「如果我的理论正确的话，那么在最低的志留纪地层沉积之前，毫无疑问已经经过了很长的时期，这个时期可能和从志留纪到现代的整个时间跨度一样长，或者可能更长；在这些漫长而尚未被了解的时期里，地球上已经充满了生物活动」（第 307 页）。

Paleontologists have now established a good record of Precambrian life. The world did swarm indeed, but only with single-celled forms and multi-cellular algae, until the latest Precambrian fauna of the Ediacara beds (begin­ning about 600 million years ago). The explosion of multicellular life now seems as abrupt as ever — even more so since the argument now rests on copi­ous documentation of Precambrian life, rather than a paucity of evidence that could be attributed to imperfections of the geological record (see Chapter 10, pp. 1155–1161). Darwin on the other hand, predicted that complex, multi­cellular creatures must extend far into the Precambrian. He wrote: "I cannot doubt that all the Silurian [= Cambrian] trilobites have descended from some one crustacean, which must have lived long before the Silurian [= Cambrian] age" (p. 306). Darwin also conjectured, again incorrectly, that the ancestral verterbrate, an animal with an adult phenotype resembling the common embryological Bauplan of all modern vertebrates, must have lived long before the dawn of Cambrian times: "It would be vain to look for [adult] animals having the common embryological character of the Vertebrata, until beds far beneath the lowest Silurian strata are discovered" (p. 338).

古生物学家现在已经清晰地记录了前寒武纪的生命演化。那时的地球虽然确实生机勃勃，但主要是单细胞生物和多细胞藻类，直到大约 6 亿年前的埃迪卡拉动物群出现。多细胞生命的突然爆发依然显得很突兀 —— 甚至更为明显，因为现在我们拥有丰富的前寒武纪生命记录，而不再是过去由于地质记录不全而导致的证据不足（参见第 10 章，第 1155-1161 页）。然而，达尔文曾预测复杂的多细胞生物应该早在前寒武纪就已经存在。他写道：「我毫不怀疑，所有的志留纪（即寒武纪）的三叶虫都起源于某种甲壳动物，这种动物早在志留纪（即寒武纪）之前就已存在」（第 306 页）。达尔文还错误地推测，脊椎动物的祖先，其成体形态与现代所有脊椎动物的胚胎结构相似，应该早在寒武纪之前就出现：「在发现远低于最底层志留纪地层的岩床之前，寻找具有脊椎动物共同胚胎特征的成体动物是徒劳的」（第 338 页）。

Darwin struggled for clarity and consistency. He did not always succeed. (How can an honest person so prevail in our complex and confusing world? I shall, for example, examine Darwin's ambivalences on progress in Chapter 6.) Darwin did not always keep the different senses of gradualism distinct. He frequently conflated meanings, arguing (for example) that the validity of nat­ural selection (sense 2) required an acceptance of slow and continuous flux (sense 3). Consider once again the following familiar passage: "It may be said that natural selection is daily and hourly scrutinizing, throughout the world, every variation, even the slightest... We see nothing of these slow changes in progress, until the hand of time has marked the long lapse of ages" (p. 84).

达尔文在追求清晰性和一致性方面遇到了困难，他并不是总能成功。（在我们这个复杂而令人困惑的世界中，一个诚实的人如何能如此成功？例如，我将在第六章中探讨达尔文在进步问题上的矛盾心理。）达尔文并不总能区分渐进主义的不同含义。他常常混淆这些含义，例如，他认为自然选择（意义 2）的有效性需要以缓慢而连续的变化（意义 3）为前提。请再次思考以下熟悉的段落：「可以说，自然选择每天每时都在全世界范围内仔细审视每一个变化，哪怕是最微小的…… 我们无法看到这些缓慢变化的进行，直到时间的长河将漫长的岁月标记出来」（第 84 页）。

This conflation came easily (and probably unconsciously) to Darwin, in large part because gradualism stood prior to natural selection in the core of his beliefs about the nature of things. Natural selection exemplified gradualism, not vice versa — and the various forms of gradualism converged to a sin­gle, coordinated view of life that extended its compass far beyond natural se­lection and even evolution itself. This situation inspired Huxley's frustration as he remonstrated with Darwin (see the famous quote on p. 151): you will have enough trouble convincing people about natural selection; why do you insist upon uniting this theory with an unnecessary and, by the way, false claim for gradualism?

对于达尔文来说，这种混淆很容易（可能是无意识地）产生，主要因为在他的信念核心中，渐进主义先于自然选择。自然选择是渐进主义的一个例子，而不是用渐进主义来解释自然选择 —— 各种形式的渐进主义汇聚成一种单一的、协调的生命观，其范围远远超出了自然选择，甚至超出了进化本身。这种情况让赫胥黎感到不满，因此他对达尔文提出抗议（见第 151 页的著名引言）：你已经很难说服人们相信自然选择，为什么还坚持把这个理论和一个不必要的，而且，顺便说一句，这是一个错误的渐进主义主张结合起来？

We can best sense this overarching Darwinian conviction in a lovely pas­sage that conflates all three senses of gradualism — the rationalist argument against creationism, the validation of natural selection by insensible intermediacy, and the slow pace of change at geological scales — all in the context of Darwin's homage to his guru Lyell, and his aesthetic and ethical convic­tions about the superiority of these "noble views" about natural causation and the nature of change:

在达尔文的一段优美文字中，我们可以最清晰地感受到他深信的达尔文主义。这段文字融合了渐变论的三个方面：用理性主义反对创造论，通过细微的中间变化验证自然选择，以及在地质时间尺度上变化的缓慢。这些观点展现了达尔文对他导师莱尔的敬意，以及他在审美和伦理上对自然因果关系和变化本质的「高贵观点」的信念。

I am well aware that this doctrine of natural selection ... is open to the same objections which were at first urged against Sir Charles Lyell's no­ble views on "the modern changes of the earth, as illustrative of geol­ogy;" but we now very seldom hear the action, for instance, of the coast-waves, called a trifling and insignificant cause, when applied to the exca­vation of gigantic valleys or to the formation of the longest lines of in­land cliffs. Natural selection can act only by the preservation and accu­mulation of infinitesimally small inherited modifications, each profitable to the preserved being; and as modern geology has almost banished such views as the excavation of a great valley by a single diluvial wave, so will natural selection, if it be a true principle, banish the belief in the contin­ued creation of new organic beings, or of any great and sudden modifica­tion in their structure (pp. 95-96).

我深知自然选择理论会遭遇类似于查尔斯·莱尔爵士最初提出的「现代地球变化对地质学的启示」观点所面临的反对意见。然而，如今我们很少听到有人将海岸波浪的作用视为微不足道或无关紧要，特别是在挖掘巨大山谷或形成长长的内陆悬崖线时。自然选择只能通过保存和积累极微小的有益遗传变异来发挥作用。每一种变异都对被保留的生物体有利。正如现代地质学几乎消除了认为巨大山谷是由单一洪流波浪挖掘而成的观点，如果自然选择确实是一个真实的原则，它将消除对新有机生物持续创造或其结构发生巨大和突然变化的信念（第 95-96 页）。

The adaptationist program

Darwin's three constraints on the nature of variation form a single conceptual thrust: variation only serves as a prerequisite, a source of raw material in­capable of imparting direction or generating evolutionary change by itself. Gradualism, in the second meaning of insensible intermediacy, then guaran­tees that the positive force of modification proceeds step by tiny step. There­fore, the explanation of evolution must reside in specifying the causes of change under two conditions that logically entail a primary focus on adapta­tion as a canonical result: we know the general nature of change (gradual­ism), and we have eliminated an internal source from variation itself (the ar­gument for isotropy). Change must therefore arise by interaction between external conditions (both biotic and abiotic) and the equipotential raw mate­rial of variation. Such gradual adjustment of one to the other must yield ad­aptation as a primary outcome.

适应主义方案达尔文的三个变异限制构成了一个统一的概念：变异仅仅是进化的前提条件，自身无法赋予方向或引发进化变化。渐变论的第二个含义强调进化通过细微的中介步骤逐步进行。因此，进化的解释必须在适应成为主要结果的条件下找到变化的原因：我们了解变化的一般性质（渐变论），并且已经排除了变异本身的内部来源（各向同性论证）。因此，变化由外部条件（生物和非生物）与变异材料的相互作用产生。这种逐渐的相互适应最终导致适应的产生。

Adaptational results flow logically from the mechanisms defining all other subbranches on the limb of Darwinism designated here as the "creativity of natural selection." But Darwin constructed this limb in reverse order in the psychological development of his theory. For he had long viewed an explana­tion of adaptation as the chief requirement of evolutionary theory. He sought the causes of evolution within his patrimony — the English tradition in natural theology — and he attempted to subvert this patrimony from within by ac­cepting its chief empirical postulate of good design and then providing an in­verted theoretical explanation (see p. 125).

适应的结果可以从被称为「自然选择的创造力」的达尔文主义分支的其他机制中逻辑推导出来。然而，达尔文在发展其理论的过程中，实际上是以相反的顺序来构建这个分支的。因为他早已认为解释适应性是进化理论的核心需求。他从他的背景 —— 英国自然神学传统中寻找进化的原因，并试图通过接受这个传统中的良好设计的核心经验命题，然后提出一个颠覆性的理论解释，从内部挑战这个传统（见第 125 页）。

When Darwin permits himself to make one of his rare forays into lyrical prose, we can grasp more fully (and dramatically) the extent of his feelings and the depth of his conviction. Consider the following passage on why the basic results of evolution and variation teach us so little about the origin of species, and why an understanding of mechanism requires an explanation of adaptation:

当达尔文罕见地用抒情的语言表达时，我们能更深刻地感受到他的情感和坚定的信念。想象一下以下的描述，关于为什么进化和变异的基本结果对物种起源的启示有限，以及为什么要理解机制就需要解释适应性：

But the mere existence of individual variability and of some few well-marked varieties, though necessary as the foundation for the work, helps us but little in understanding how species arise in nature. How have all those exquisite adaptations of one part of the organization to another part, and to the conditions of life, and of one distinct organic being to another being, been perfected? We see these beautiful co-adaptations most plainly in the woodpecker and missletoe; and only a little less plainly in the humblest parasite which clings to the hairs of a quadruped or feathers of a bird; in the structure of the beetle which dives through the water; in the plumed seed which is wafted by the gentlest breeze; in short, we see beautiful adaptations everywhere and in every part of the organic world (pp. 60-61).

尽管个体差异和一些明显的变种是研究的基础，但它们对理解物种在自然界中的产生帮助不大。一个生物体的不同部分之间、与生活条件之间，以及不同有机体之间的精妙适应是如何形成的？我们在啄木鸟和槲寄生身上最明显地看到了这些美妙的共同适应；即便是在附着于四足动物毛发或鸟类羽毛上的不起眼寄生虫身上，我们也能发现这种现象；在潜水甲虫的身体结构中，在随微风飘荡的有羽毛的种子中；总之，整个自然界的每个角落都存在着美丽的适应（第 60-61 页）。

Pursuing the theme of rare Darwinian lyricism as a guide to what he viewed as essential, consider his convictions about the overwhelming power of natural selection — a point that he usually conveyed by comparison with the limitations of artificial selection in breeding and agriculture:

我们可以从达尔文罕见的抒情表达中，洞察他对自然选择这一核心理念的坚定信念。他常常通过对比人工选择在育种和农业中的局限性，来强调自然选择的巨大力量。

Man can act only on external and visible characters: nature cares noth­ing for appearances, except in so far as they may be useful to any being. She can act on every internal organ, on every shade of constitutional dif­ference, on the whole machinery of life. Man selects only for his own good; Nature only for that of the being which she tends. Every selected character is fully exercised by her; and the being is placed under well-suited conditions of life. Man keeps the natives of many climates in the same country; he seldom exercises each selected character in some pecu­liar and fitting manner; he feeds a long and a short beaked pigeon on the same food; he does not exercise a long-backed or long-legged quadruped in any peculiar manner; he exposes sheep with long and short wool to the same climate. He does not allow the most vigorous males to struggle for the females. He does not rigidly destroy all inferior animals, but pro­tects during each varying season, as far as lies in his power, all his pro­ductions... Under nature, the slightest difference of structure or consti­tution may well turn the nicely balanced scale in the struggle for life and so be preserved. How fleeting are the wishes and efforts of man! how short his time! and consequently how poor will his products be, compared with those accumulated by nature during whole geological pe­riods. Can we wonder, then, that nature's productions should be far "truer" in character than man's productions; that they should be in­finitely better adapted to the most complex conditions of life, and should plainly bear the stamp of far higher workmanship? (pp. 83-84).

人只能根据外在和可见的特征来做出行动：自然并不在乎外表，除非它们对某个生物有帮助。自然能够作用于每一个内部器官，每一个体质差异的细微之处，整个生命的运作系统。人只为自己的利益进行选择，而自然则只为它所照顾的生物的利益进行选择。自然充分发展每一个被选择的特征，并将生物置于适合的生活条件下。人将许多气候的本地物种保留在同一个国家，很少以某种特殊和适当的方式发展每一个被选择的特征；他用同样的食物喂养长喙和短喙的鸽子，也不以任何特殊方式发展长背或长腿的四足动物；他让长毛和短毛的羊暴露在同样的气候中。他不允许最强壮的雄性为雌性而斗争，也不严格消灭所有低劣的动物，而是在每个变化的季节，尽其所能保护他所有的产物…… 在自然界中，结构或体质的微小差异可能在生存斗争中起到关键作用，从而被保留下来。人的愿望和努力是多么短暂！他的时间是多么短暂！因此，与自然在整个地质时期积累的产物相比，他的产物就显得多么贫乏。我们能否因此惊讶，自然的产物在特性上要比人的产物「更真实"；它们更好地适应最复杂的生活条件，并且明显带有更高水平的工艺印记？(第 83-84 页）。

But Darwin's world also differs strongly from Paley's, and the outcome of natural selection, however great the power of Darwin's mechanism, cannot be perfection, but only improvement to a point of competitive superiority in local circumstances. Natural selection operates as a principle of "better than," not as a doctrine of perfection: "Natural selection tends only to make each organic being as perfect as, or slightly more perfect than, the other in­habitants of the same country with which it has to struggle for existence" (p. 201). Thus, the signs of history will not be erased; creatures will retain sig­natures of their past as quirks, oddities and imperfections (see pp. 111-116 on methodology). Natural selection will fashion the organic world, while leaving enough signs of her previous handiwork to reveal a forming presence.

然而，达尔文的世界与帕利的世界存在显著差异。尽管达尔文的自然选择机制具有强大的力量，其结果并非完美无瑕，而仅仅是在特定环境中获得竞争优势的改进。自然选择的原则在于「优于」，而非追求完美：「自然选择只倾向于让每个有机体尽量完美，或比其所需竞争生存的同一地区的其他生物略微完美一些」（第 201 页）。因此，进化历史的痕迹不会被抹去；生物依然会保留进化过程中遗留下来的特征，如奇异、怪癖和缺陷（参见第 111-116 页关于方法论的内容）。自然选择将塑造有机世界，但仍会留下足够的痕迹，显示出其形成的过程。

I have called this section "the adaptationist program," rather than, simply, "adaptation" because Darwin presents a protocol for actual research, not just an abstract conceptual structure. The relevant arguments may be ordered in various ways, but consider this sequence:

我之所以称这一节为「适应主义程序」，而不是简单地称为「适应」，是因为达尔文不仅仅提供了一个抽象的概念框架，更是提出了一套实际的研究方法。相关的论点虽然可以以不同的顺序排列，但可以考虑以下的顺序：

• Adaptation is the central phenomenon of evolution, and the key to any understanding of mechanisms.

• Natural selection crafts adaptation.

- 适应是进化中的核心现象，是理解各种机制的关键。
- 自然选择在适应的形成中发挥了重要作用。

• Natural selection maintains an overwhelmingly predominant relative frequency as a cause of adaptation. Variation only provides raw material, and cannot do the work unaided.

自然选择在适应过程中具有压倒性的主导作用。变异只是提供了基础材料，单靠变异无法实现适应的过程。

Adaptation may be viewed as a problem of transforming environmental (external) information into internal changes of form, physiology and behav­ior. Two forces other than natural selection might play such a role — the cre­ative response of organisms to felt needs with inheritance of acquired charac­ters (Lamarck's system), or direct impress of environments upon organisms, also with inheritance of traits thus acquired (a system often associated with Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire). Darwin regards both alternatives as true causes, and he explicitly contrasts them with natural selection in several passages within the Origin. But, in these statements and elsewhere, he always grants natural selection the cardinal role by virtue of relative frequency — "by far the pre­dominant Power," he writes on page 43, in upper case for emphasis. "Over all other causes of change, I am convinced that Natural Selection is para­mount" (in Natural Selection, 1975 edition, p. 223).

适应可以看作是一个将外部环境信息转化为内部形式、生理和行为变化的过程。除了自然选择，还有两种可能的力量可以发挥这样的作用：一种是生物体对自身需求的创造性反应，伴随获得性状的遗传（拉马克的理论）；另一种是环境对生物体的直接影响，也伴随获得性状的遗传（通常与 Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire 相关的理论）。达尔文认为这两种可能性都是真实的原因，并在《物种起源》中多次将它们与自然选择进行对比。然而，无论是在这些陈述还是在其他地方，他始终认为自然选择因其相对频繁的作用而占据主要地位。他在第 43 页中写道：「毫无疑问，自然选择是主要力量。」在《自然选择》（1975 年版，第 223 页）中，他进一步指出：「在所有其他变化原因之上，我确信自然选择是首要的。」

In this light, how should evolutionists proceed if they wish to discover the mechanisms of change? Should they study the causes of variation (a vitally important issue, but unresolvable in Darwin's time, and not the cause of change in any case)? Or should they examine the large-scale phenomena of taxonomic order or geographic distribution (issues of great import again, but lying too far from immediate causation)? Instead, the best strategy, Darwin asserts, lies in the study of adaptation, for adaptation is the direct and pri­mary result of natural selection; and the relative frequency of selection stands so high that almost any adaptation will record its forming power.

那么，进化论者要想揭示变化的机制，应该采取什么策略呢？是应该研究变异的原因（这是一个非常重要的问题，但在达尔文时代难以解决，并且不直接导致变化），还是研究分类顺序或地理分布的宏观现象（这些问题固然重要，但与直接原因相距甚远）？达尔文认为，最好的策略是研究适应性，因为适应性是自然选择的直接和主要结果；且选择发生的频率非常高，几乎每一种适应性都能反映出自然选择的作用。

Adaptation therefore becomes, for Darwin, the primary subject for practi­cal study of evolutionary mechanisms. Recall the basic methodological prob­lem of a science of history (see p. 102): science aims, above all, to understand causal processes; past processes cannot be observed in principle; we must therefore learn about past causes by making inferences from preserved re­sults. Adaptation is the common and coordinating result of nearly any epi­sode of non-trivial evolutionary change. Adaptation not only pervades nature with an overwhelming relative frequency, but also embodies the immediate action of the primary cause of change — natural selection. The adaptations of organisms therefore constitute the bread and butter objects of study in evolu­tionary biology. Our first order approach to change must pose the following question in any particular case: what adaptive value can we assign; how did natural selection work in this instance? In a revealing statement, Darwin rolls all exceptions, all ifs and buts, into a set of subsidiaries to adaptation forged by natural selection — as either consequences of adaptation, inherited marks of older adaptations, or rare products of other processes: "Hence every detail of structure in every living creature (making some little allowance for the di­rect action of physical conditions) may be viewed, either as having been of special use to some ancestral form or as being now of special use to the descendants of this form — either directly, or indirectly through the complex laws of growth" (p. 200).

因此，在达尔文看来，适应性是研究进化机制的核心课题之一。我们回顾一下历史科学的基本方法论问题（见第 102 页）：科学的主要目标是理解因果过程，但过去的过程无法直接观察，我们必须通过推断保存下来的结果来了解过去的原因。适应性几乎是所有重要进化变化的共同和协调的结果。它不仅在自然界中非常普遍，还直接体现了变化的主要驱动力 —— 自然选择。因此，生物的适应性成为了进化生物学研究的基本对象。在研究变化时，我们首先要问：在这个特定情况下，我们能赋予什么样的适应价值？自然选择又是如何在其中发挥作用的呢？达尔文在一段引人深思的论述中，将所有例外情况、假设等都归结为自然选择所塑造的适应性附属品 —— 这些可能是适应性的结果、过去适应性的遗传标记，或其他过程的罕见产物：「因此，任何生物的结构细节（略考虑物理条件的直接影响）都可以看作是对某个祖先形式有特殊用途，或者现在对后代有特殊用途，不论是直接作用还是通过复杂的生长规律间接产生的」（第 200 页）。

The primary anti-Darwinian argument of late 19th century biology pro­ceeded by denying a creative role to natural selection — but Darwin countered with a strong riposte. If adaptation pervades nature and must be constructed by natural selection, and if the steps of evolutionary sequences are generally so tiny that we may seek their source in palpable events subject to our direct view and manipulation, then we not only gain a theoretical explanation for evolutionary change. We also obtain the practical gift of a workable research program rooted in the observable and the resolvable.

19 世纪晚期，生物学中主要的反达尔文论点是否认自然选择具有创造性作用 —— 但达尔文对此进行了强有力的反驳。假如自然界中普遍存在适应性，并且这种适应性必须通过自然选择来构建，而进化的步骤通常非常细微，以至于我们可以在那些可以直接观察和操控的事件中找到其来源，那么我们不仅能获得对进化变化的理论解释，还能得到一个基于可观察和可操作的实用研究计划。

But nothing so precious comes without a price, or without consequences. Darwin's argument works; no logical holes remain. But the research program thus entailed must embody attitudes and assumptions not necessarily true — or at least not necessarily valid at sufficiently high relative frequency to make the world exclusively, or even primarily, Darwinian. To accept Darwin's full argument about the creativity of natural selection, one must buy into an en­tire conceptual world — a world where externalities direct, and internalities supply raw material but impose no serious constraint upon change; a world where the functional impetus for change comes first and the structural alter­ation of form can only follow. The creativity of natural selection makes adap­tation central, isotropy of variation necessary, and gradualism pervasive.

然而，任何珍贵的事物都伴随着代价和后果。达尔文的论点是无懈可击的，没有任何逻辑漏洞。但是，这一研究计划需要包含某些态度和假设，这些假设并不一定是真实的 —— 至少在相对频率足够高的情况下，它们不一定有效，因此世界不可能完全或主要由达尔文主义主导。为了完全接受达尔文关于自然选择创造力的论点，人们必须认同一个完整的概念体系 —— 在这个体系中，外部因素引导发展，内部因素提供原材料，但不会对变化施加重大限制；在这里，功能变化是首要的，而结构形式的改变紧随其后。自然选择的创造力使得适应成为核心，变化的均匀性成为必要，渐进主义普遍存在。

But suppose these precepts do not govern a commanding relative frequency of cases? What if adaptation does not always record the primacy of natural selection, but often arises as secondary fine tuning of structures arising in other ways? What if variation imposes strong constraints and supplies pow­erful channels of preferred direction for change? What if the nature of varia­tion (particularly as expressed in development) often produces change with­out insensible intermediacy?

假设这些原则并没有在大多数情况下占据主导地位呢？如果生物适应性并不总是由自然选择的首要地位决定，而常常是其他方式产生的结构的细微调整呢？如果变异施加了强大的限制并引导了变革的优先方向呢？如果变异的特性（特别是在发育过程中表现出来时）常常导致明显的变化，而不是通过不易察觉的中间步骤呢？

All these arguments merge into a structuralist critique that seriously challenges the predominant functionalism of classical Darwinism. As a common thread, these challenges deny exclusivity to natural selection as the agent of creativity, and claim a high relative frequency of control by internal factors. McCosh was right in establishing his pre-evolutionary contrast of a "princi­ple of order" and a "principle of special adaptation" (see p. 116). Darwin was right in translating this distinction into evolutionary terms as "Unity of Type" and "Conditions of Existence," though he was probably wrong in his fateful decision — the basis of Darwinian functionalism — to yoke the two cat­egories together under a common cause by defining unity of type as the his­torical legacy of previous adaptation, thus asserting the domination of natu­ral selection (1859, p. 206 — see extensive commentary in chapter 4). And E. S. Russell (1916) was also right in contrasting the "formal or transcenden­tal" with the "functional or synthetic" approach to morphology.

这些论点汇聚成一种结构主义批判，严肃地挑战了经典达尔文主义中的功能主义。这些挑战的共同点是否认自然选择是唯一的创造力来源，强调内在因素的控制频率较高。McCosh 在提出他的「秩序原则」和「特殊适应原则」时做得很对（参见第 116 页）。达尔文也正确地将这种区分转化为进化术语，即「类型的统一」和「存在的条件」。然而，他可能犯了个错误，这也是达尔文功能主义的基础，即将类型的统一定义为过去适应的历史遗产，从而强调自然选择的主导地位（1859，第 206 页 —— 参见第 4 章中的详细评论）。E. S. Russell（1916）在对比「形式的或超验的」与「功能的或综合的」形态学方法时的观点也是正确的。

We are children of Darwin, and an English school of adaptation and functionalism far older than evolutionary theory. Darwin's key claim for the creativity of natural selection — and the resulting sequelae of gradualism, adaptationism, and the isotropy of variation — builds the main line of defense for this powerful and venerable attitude towards nature and change. For many of us, these claims lie too close to the core of our deeply assimilated and now largely unconscious beliefs to be challenged, or even overtly recognized as something potentially disputable. Yet a coherent alternative has been pro­posed, and now provides one of the three most trenchant modern critiques of strict Darwinism. I believe that these critiques, taken together, will reorient evolutionary theory into a richer structure with a Darwinian core. But we cannot appreciate the alternatives until we grasp the basis of orthodoxy as an argument of compelling brilliance and power. Important critiques can only operate against great orthodoxies.

达尔文的思想深深影响了我们，我们继承了一个比进化论更古老的英国适应和功能主义学派。达尔文关于自然选择创造力的核心观点，以及由此衍生的渐进主义、适应论和变异均匀性的概念，构成了支持这种对自然和变化的强大观念的主要基础。对于许多人来说，这些观点已经深深植根于我们的思维中，成为我们无意识的一部分，以至于很少有人会质疑它们。然而，已经有一致的替代观点被提出，并且成为对严格达尔文主义的三大现代尖锐批评之一。我相信，这些批评结合在一起，将使进化理论重新发展成为一个以达尔文主义为核心的更丰富的结构。但是，只有当我们理解了正统观点作为一个有力且具有说服力的理论基础时，我们才能真正理解这些替代观点。重要的批评往往是针对伟大的正统思想而展开的。

THE THIRD THEME: THE UNIFORMITARIAN NEED TO

EXTRAPOLATE; ENVIRONMENT AS ENABLER OF CHANGE

未找到意译内容

The first two themes — causal focus on organisms as agents of selection and creativity of selection in crafting adaptation — establish the biological core of Darwinian theory. That is, they perform the biological "work" needed to as­sure the third and last essential component of a Darwinian worldview: the uniformitarian argument for full application in extrapolation to all scales and times in the history of life. Mere operation in the microevolutionary here and now cannot suffice. Natural selection must also assert a vigorous claim for preeminence throughout the 3.5 billion years of phylogeny, lest the theory be reduced to an ornamental device, imposing only a fillip of immediate adap­tive detail upon a grand pageant generated by other causes and forces.

前两个主题 —— 生物体作为选择的代理以及选择在适应性塑造中的创造力 —— 构成了达尔文理论的生物学核心。换句话说，它们为达尔文世界观的第三个也是最后一个关键组成部分奠定了基础：均变论，旨在将理论扩展到生命历史的所有尺度和时间。仅仅关注现在的微观进化是不够的。自然选择必须在整个 35 亿年的进化史中证明其重要性，否则，这一理论将沦为一种装饰性工具，仅仅在由其他因素和力量造就的宏伟历史中添加些许即时的适应性细节。

Darwin, who fledged professionally as a geologist (the subject of his first three scientific books in the 1840's, on coral reefs, volcanic islands, and the geology of South America), and who regarded Charles Lyell as his intellectual hero, while embracing his mentor's doctrine of uniformitarianism as the core of his own philosophy as well, fully understood that his revolution would succeed only if he could show how natural selection might act as architect for the full panoply of life's history throughout geological time. The "method­ological pole," one of the two foci of Darwin's revolution (see Section II of this chapter), brilliantly develops a set of procedures for defending extrapola­tion in various contexts of limited evidence.

达尔文最初是一位地质学家（19 世纪 40 年代，他的前三本科学著作是关于珊瑚礁、火山岛和南美地质的），他把查尔斯·莱尔视为自己的智力偶像，并将其均变论思想作为自己哲学的核心。达尔文深知，他的革命性理论只有在他能证明自然选择能够在整个地质时代中作为生命历史的「建筑师」时才能成功。达尔文革命的两个核心之一的「方法论支柱」（参见本章第二节），巧妙地制定了一套在证据有限的情况下进行推测的方法。

The link of the first two themes (agency and efficacy) to this third theme of extended scope or capacity — thus forming in their threefold ensemble a minimally complete statement of revolution — received succinct expression in Ernst Mayr's (1963, p. 586) epitome of Darwinism as preached by the Mod­ern Synthesis: "All evolution is due to the accumulation of small genetic changes, guided by natural selection [the first two themes of agency and efficacy], and that transpecific evolution [the third theme of scope, or uniformitarian extension] is nothing but an extrapolation and magnification of the events that take place within populations and species."

第一个主题（能动性和功效）与第三个主题（扩展的范围或能力）的关系，在这三个主题的组合中形成了一种基本的革命性完整陈述。Ernst Mayr（1963，第 586 页）在其对现代综合达尔文主义的总结中对此进行了简洁的表达：「所有进化都源于小规模遗传变化的积累，并由自然选择引导（即能动性和功效这两个主题），而跨物种的进化（即范围或均变性扩展的第三个主题）只不过是种群和物种内部事件的延伸和放大。」

In this book, my explicit discussion for this third theme of extrapolation (Chapters 6 and 12) shall be shorter than my treatment of the first theme of agency (Chapters 3 and 8–9), leading from Darwin's nearly exclusive focus on the organismal level to the modern revision of hierarchical selection the­ory, and the second theme of efficacy (Chapters 4–5 and 10–11) on older and modern critiques of panadaptationism, with an emphasis on structural prin­ciples and constraints. I allocate my attention in this unequal manner because the first two themes already include, within themselves, the biological argu­ments for extrapolation, as embodied in Darwin's uniformitarian beliefs and practices. For my explicit and separate treatment of the crucial extrapolationist theme in this work, I therefore follow a different strategy, if only to avoid redundancy in a book that we all undoubtedly regard, author and read­ers alike, as quite long enough already! I will not rehearse Darwin's biological arguments for extrapolation, but will rather, as a "place holder" of sorts, concentrate upon the nature of the geological stage that must welcome Dar­win's biological play.

在本书中，我对第三个主题 —— 推断（第 6 和第 12 章）的讨论会比第一个主题 —— 生物能动性（第 3 和第 8-9 章）要简短。我们从达尔文几乎只关注生物个体的研究，发展到现代的层级选择理论，再到第二个主题 —— 效能（第 4-5 章和第 10-11 章），它讨论了对泛适应论的旧有和现代批评，特别是强调结构原则和限制。我之所以这样分配篇幅，是因为前两个主题中已经包含了关于推断的生物学论证，这些论证体现在达尔文的均变理论和实践中。因此，为了避免在这本已经相当冗长的书中出现重复，我对关键的推断主题采取不同的策略。我不会重复达尔文关于推断的生物学论证，而是将其作为「占位符」，集中讨论地质舞台的性质，这个舞台必须接纳达尔文的生物学剧目。

I proceed in this way for a principled reason, and not merely as a convenience. All major evolutionary theories before Darwin, and nearly all important versions that followed his enunciation of natural selection as well, retained fealty to an ancient Western tradition, dating to Plato and other clas­sical authors, by presenting a fundamentally "internalist" account, based upon intrinsic and predictable patterns set by the nature of living systems, for development or "unfolding" through time. (Ironically, such internalist theo­ries follow the literal meaning of "evolution" (unfolding) far better than the Darwinian system that eventually absorbed the term. Darwin understood this etymological point perfectly well, and he initially declined to use the word "evolution" — preferring "descent with modification" — probably because he recognized the difference between the literal meaning of "evolution" and his own concept of life's history and change by natural selection — see Gould, 2000a.)

我这样做是出于原则，而不仅仅是为了图方便。在达尔文之前的所有主要进化理论，以及他阐明自然选择后的重要版本，大多忠实于一种古老的西方传统，源于柏拉图和其他古典作者。这些理论通常提供了一种「内在主义」的解释，认为生命系统的发展或「展开」是基于其本质所设定的内在和可预测模式。（讽刺的是，这种内在主义理论实际上比后来的达尔文体系更符合「进化」（展开）这个词的字面意义。达尔文对此心知肚明，所以他起初避免使用「进化」一词，而更倾向于使用「变异后代」。他这样做是因为他意识到「进化」一词的字面意义与他通过自然选择来解释生命历史和变化的概念并不一致 —— 参见 Gould，2000a。）

Darwin's theory, in strong and revolutionary contrast, presents a first "externalist" account of evolution, in which contingent change (the summation of unpredictable local adaptations rather than a deterministic unfolding of in­herent potential under internal, biological principles) proceeds by an interac­tion between organic raw material (undirected variation) and environmental guidance (natural selection). Darwin overturned all previous traditions by thus granting the external environment a causal and controlling role in the di­rection of evolutionary change (with "environment" construed as the ensem­ble of biotic and abiotic factors of course, but still external to the organism, however intrinsically locked to, and even largely defined by, the presence of the organism itself). Thus, and finally, in considering the validity of extrapo­lation to complete the roster of essential Darwinian claims, the role of the geological stage becomes an appropriate focus as a surrogate for more overtly biological discussion.

达尔文的理论与早期的理论形成了强烈而革命性的对比。他首次提出了「外部论」的演化解释。在他的理论中，演化并不是依靠生物内部的确定性展开，而是通过有机体的原始材料（无方向的变异）和环境的指导（自然选择）之间的互动来实现的。达尔文颠覆了之前的所有传统，因为他认为外部环境在演化的方向上扮演着因果和控制的角色。这里的「环境」指的是包括生物和非生物因素的整体，虽然它与生物体息息相关，甚至在很大程度上由生物体本身定义，但仍然被视为外部因素。最后，在评估达尔文基本主张的完整性时，地质环境的作用成为了一个比纯生物学讨论更为显著的焦点。

If the uniqueness of Darwinism, and its revolutionary character as well, inheres largely in the formulation of natural selection as a theory of interaction between biological insides and environmental outsides — and not as a theory of evolutio, or intrinsic unfolding — then "outsides" must receive explicit dis­cussion as well, a need best fulfilled within this treatment of extrapolation. Under internalist theories of evolution, environment, at most, holds power to derail the process by not behaving properly — drying up, as on Mars, or freez­ing over, as nearly occurred on Earth more than once during our planet's geo­logical history. Under Darwinian functionalism, however, environment be­comes an active partner in both the modes and directions of evolutionary change.

如果达尔文主义的独特性和革命性主要体现在自然选择被描述为生物体内部与外部环境之间相互作用的理论，而不是一种进化或内在发展的理论，那么对「外部环境」的明确讨论就显得尤为重要，这个需求最好在对外推的研究中解决。在内在论的进化理论中，环境的作用最多只是因为条件不合适而中断进化过程，例如像火星那样干涸，或像地球在地质历史上多次面临的冻结。然而，在达尔文的功能主义中，环境在进化变化的方式和方向上扮演着积极的角色。

As the Utopian tradition recognizes, we can often devise lovely and optimal systems in abstract principle, but then be utterly unable to apply them in practice because an imperfect world precludes their operation. The central logic of Darwinism faces an issue of this kind. The two essential biological postulates of natural selection — its operation at the organismal level, and its creativity in crafting adaptations — build a sufficient theoretical apparatus to fuel the system. The play of evolution can run with such a minimal cast, but we do not know whether the drama can actually unfold on our planet until we also examine and specify the character of the theater — the geological and environmental stage for the play of natural selection. The geological stage therefore becomes a major actor in the drama set on its own premises.

正如乌托邦的思想所揭示的，我们常常能在理论上设计出理想的系统，但在现实中却因世界的不完美而难以实施。达尔文主义的核心逻辑也面临类似的问题。自然选择的两个关键生物学原理 —— 在生物个体层面的运作和适应性的创造力 —— 提供了足够的理论基础来支撑这一系统。进化过程可以在这样简单的条件下进行，但除非我们研究并明确自然选择所依赖的地质和环境舞台的特性，否则无法确定这一过程能否在地球上真正展开。因此，地质环境本身就成为这一演绎过程中的重要角色。

Moreover, and reinforcing my argument that Darwin's strength lies in his brave specificity, Darwin places a great burden on geology and environment by devising such stringent conditions for the nature of this external setting. Again, we encounter the Goldilocks problem — environment cannot impose too much or provide too little, but must be "just right" in the middle.

此外，为了更好地支持我的论点，我认为达尔文的优势在于他敢于具体化细节。达尔文为外部环境设定了极其严格的条件，这对地质和环境造成了很大的压力。再次，我们遇到了所谓的「金发姑娘问题」—— 即环境的影响力不能太强也不能太弱，而必须「恰到好处」。

Environment, as an active Darwinian agent, cannot under perform. In particular, an absence of environmental change would probably bring evolution to an eventual halt, as selective pressures for adaptive alteration diminished (see Stenseth and Maynard Smith, 1984). Purely biotic interaction might drive evolution for some time following a cessation of environmental change, but probably not indefinitely.

环境作为一个积极参与进化的达尔文智能体，不能表现得不够出色。特别是，如果环境不发生变化，进化可能会最终停滞，因为适应性改变的选择压力会减弱（参见 Stenseth 和 Maynard Smith，1984）。即便是在环境变化停止后，纯粹的生物相互作用可能仍能在一段时间内推动进化，但这不太可能无限期地持续下去。

The possibility of too little change has rarely been viewed as a threat to Darwinism, largely because the geological record seems so clearly to empha­size potential dangers in the other direction (though see pp. 492–502 on Lord Kelvin). The specter of "too much" change, on the other hand, has haunted Darwinism from the start. In particular, if the theory of geological catastrophism were generally true, or even just sufficiently important in relative frequency, then Darwinism would be compromised as the primary agent of pattern in the history of life.

变化太少的可能性通常不被视为对达尔文主义的威胁，这主要是因为地质记录明显显示了变化过多的潜在危险（详见第 492-502 页关于 Lord Kelvin 的部分）。然而，变化过多的可能性自始至终都是达尔文主义面临的一个问题。特别是，如果地质灾变理论普遍成立，或者即使它在相对频率上足够重要，那么达尔文主义作为解释生命历史模式的主要机制就会受到挑战。

By catastrophism, I mean to designate the classical theory of global parox­ysm as a primary agent of geological change — in particular, the idea that mass extinctions thus engendered might lie largely outside the domain of tradi­tional Darwinism. Of course, mass extinctions cannot be construed as "undarwinian" per se. If environment changes so rapidly that organisms cannot adapt fast enough by natural selection, then many species will die. But, in a conceptual world of relative frequency, where Darwinism must not only op­erate, but also dominate as the creator of change, such formative power for mass extinction constitutes a serious challenge. If we survey the entire history of life, and find that catastrophic mass extinction, with non-Darwinian fortu­ity in causes of change (on either the "random" or the "different rules" model — see Chapter 12, and Gould, 1985a, 1993c), establishes more features of overall pattern than the ordinary interplay of taxa during normal times (between such episodes of coordinated death) can build and maintain, then Darwin's view of life lacks the generality once accorded. In particular, the key uniformitarian argument will then fail. The adaptive struggles of immediate moments will not extrapolate to explain the patterns of life's history. More­over, if these undarwinian components of fortuity in extinction, and success for reasons unrelated to the original adaptive basis of traits, also maintain strong influence at lesser scales of smaller mass extinctions (Raup and Sepkoski, 1984), and even, in a fractal manner, for some ordinary extinctions in normal times (Raup, 1991), then the challenge may become truly pervasive.

所谓的灾变论，指的是一种经典理论，认为全球性的剧变是地质变化的主要动力，尤其是认为这种剧变导致的大规模灭绝可能不属于传统达尔文主义的范畴。当然，大规模灭绝本身并不一定违背达尔文主义。如果环境变化得太快，以至于生物无法通过自然选择迅速适应，许多物种就会灭绝。然而，在一个达尔文主义不仅应当运行而且应当主导变化的理念中，这种大规模灭绝的影响力构成了严峻的挑战。如果我们回顾整个生命的历史，发现灾难性的大规模灭绝，其原因可能是偶然的（无论是「随机」还是「不同规则」的模型 —— 见第 12 章，以及 Gould，1985a，1993c），比正常时期物种间的常规互动对生命整体模式的影响更大，那么达尔文对生命的看法就不再具有以往的普遍性。尤其是，传统的「均变论」理论将会失效。眼前的适应性斗争无法解释整个生命历史的模式。此外，如果这些非达尔文的偶然因素在较小规模的大规模灭绝中仍有很大影响（Raup and Sepkoski，1984），甚至在平常时期的一些普通灭绝中也起作用（Raup，1991），那么这种挑战可能会变得非常普遍。

These characterizations of Darwinian requirements cannot be dismissed or downgraded as conjectures or reconstructions, only inferentially based on deductions from premises stated by Darwin for different reasons. Darwin de­voted an entire chapter of the Origin, number 10 "on the geological succes­sion of organic beings," to an exploration of the geological stage and its requirements for natural selection. He argues that biotic competition, gradualistically expressed through time as coordinated waxing and waning of in­teracting clades, marks the overall pattern of life — and that the apparent fos­sil evidence for more rapid change, set by physical environments and leading to mass extinctions, must generally be read as artifacts of an imperfect record (see Chapter 12 for detailed exegesis of Darwin's arguments on this subject). This issue exposes another essential Darwinian theme not yet discussed (but receiving full treatment in Chapter 6) — the nature of competition; the preva­lence of biotic over abiotic effects; the metaphor of the wedge; and the funda­mental role of Darwinian ecology as a validator of progress (in the absence of any available defense from the bare-bones mechanism of natural selection it­self). Thus, the argument for uniformitarian change in geology undergirds a central conviction of the Darwinian corpus.

对于达尔文要求的这些特征描述，不能简单地将其看作是推测或重构，也不能因为它们是基于达尔文出于不同目的提出的前提推导出来的，就轻视它们。达尔文在《物种起源》的第十章中，专门讨论了自然选择的地质背景及其要求。这一章名为「论有机体的地质演替」。他指出，生物之间的竞争通过时间的推移逐渐显现，以相互作用的类群此消彼长为特征，反映了生命的整体模式。相较之下，那些由于物理环境变化引起的大规模灭绝和快速变化的化石证据，往往只能被看作是不完整记录的结果 （关于达尔文在这一主题上的详细论述，请参见第十二章）。这个问题还揭示了达尔文学说中的另一个重要主题 —— 竞争的本质；生物效应相对于非生物效应的影响；楔子的隐喻；以及达尔文生态学在验证进步中的基本作用（因为自然选择本身的基本机制并没有提供足够的解释）。因此，地质学中的均变论变化论证支撑了达尔文学说的核心信念。

We cannot overestimate the depth of Darwin's debt to his intellectual hero, Charles Lyell. The uniformitarianism of his mentor not only provided, by transfer into biology, a theory of evolutionary change. The doctrine of unifor­mity also supplied, on its original geological turf, a world that could grant enough slow and continuous environmental change to fuel natural selec­tion — but not so much, or so quickly, that selection would be overcome, and the rein of pattern seized by environment in its own right. In natural selec­tion, environment proposes and organisms dispose; this subtle balance of in­side and outside must be maintained. But in a world of too much environ­mental change, the external component does not only propose, but can also dispose of organisms and species without much backtalk. Darwinism does not run well on such a one-way street.

我们无法低估达尔文对他心目中的智者查尔斯·莱尔的深刻影响。莱尔的均变论不仅为生物学中的进化变化提供了理论框架。在其原本的地质学领域，均变论也描绘了一个世界，在这个世界中，环境变化缓慢而连续，为自然选择提供了动力，但变化不会过于迅速，以至于自然选择失去作用，被环境本身的变化所主导。在自然选择的过程中，环境提出条件，而生物体则进行适应和调整；这种内外因素的微妙平衡必须保持。然而，如果环境变化过于剧烈，外部因素不仅提出条件，还可能在没有太多反抗的情况下决定生物体和物种的命运。达尔文主义在这种单方面的环境中难以有效运作。

Judgments of Importance

In the difficult genre of comprehensive historical reviews, a few special books stand out as so fair in their judgments and so lucid in their characterizations that they set the conceptual boundaries of disciplines for generations. In mor­phology, E. S. Russell's Form and Function (1916) occupies this role for the brilliance and justice of its characterizations, even though Russell, as an avowed Lamarckian, made no secret about his own preferences (and made the wrong choice by modern standards). In evolutionary biology, similar plaudits may be granted to Vernon L. Kellogg's Darwinism Today (1907). Kellogg, a great educator and entomologist from Stanford, had collaborated with David Starr Jordan on the best textbooks of his generation. He also played an ironic role in the history of evolution by serving a term (while America maintained her early neutrality) as chief agent for Belgian relief, posted to the German General Staff in Berlin during World War I. There, he listened in horror to German leaders perverting Darwinism as a justification for war and conquest — and he exposed these distortions in his fascinating volume, Headquarters Nights (1917). William Jennings Bryan read this book and, understanding the abuse but blaming the victims of misinterpretation rather than the perpetrators, launched his campaign to ban the teaching of evolution as a result (see Gould, 1991b).

在撰写全面历史评论这种复杂的体裁中，少数特别的书籍因其公正的判断和清晰的描述而脱颖而出，甚至为学科定义了几代人的概念范围。在形态学领域，E. S. Russell 的《形式与功能》（1916）就因其精彩且公正的描述而扮演了这样的角色。虽然 Russell 是公开的拉马克主义者，并不掩饰自己的偏好，但从现代标准来看，他的选择是错误的。在进化生物学中，Vernon L. Kellogg 的《今日达尔文主义》（1907）也获得了类似的赞誉。Kellogg 是斯坦福大学的杰出教育家和昆虫学家，与 David Starr Jordan 合作编写了那个时代最优秀的教科书。他在进化史上也有一个讽刺性的角色：在美国保持早期中立时，他作为比利时救济的首席代理，被派往第一次世界大战期间的德国总参谋部驻柏林。在那里，他震惊地听到德国领导人滥用达尔文主义，将其作为战争和侵略的理由。他在引人入胜的著作《总部之夜》（1917）中揭露了这些歪曲。William Jennings Bryan 读了这本书，理解了这种滥用，但他将责任归咎于误解的受害者而非肇事者，由此发起了一场禁止教授进化论的运动（参见 Gould，1991b）。

As the Darwinian centennial of 1909 neared, Kellogg decided to write a volume providing a fair hearing for all varieties of Darwinism, and all alter­native views in a decade of maximal agnosticism and diversity in evolution­ary theories. Kellogg's book adopts the same premise as this treatise — that Darwinism embodies a meaningful central logic, or "essence," and that other proposals about evolutionary mechanisms can be classified with reference to their consonance or dissonance with these basic Darwinian commitments.

随着 1909 年达尔文诞辰一百周年的临近，Kellogg 决定撰写一本书，旨在为所有种类的达尔文主义以及在那个充满怀疑和多样化进化理论的十年中出现的各种替代观点提供一个公正的平台。Kellogg 的书与本论文持有相同的观点 —— 即达尔文主义包含一种重要的核心逻辑，或称之为「本质」，其他关于进化机制的主张则可以根据它们与这些基本达尔文主义原则的契合或偏离来进行分类。

I was particularly pleased to learn that Kellogg's categories, though differ­ently named and parsed, are identical with those recognized here. He divides the plethora of proposals under discussion in his time into those "auxiliary to" and those "alternative to" natural selection. Among auxiliaries that aid, expand, improve, or lie within the spirit of Darwinism, Kellogg highlights two principal themes: studies of Wagner, Jordan, and Gulick on the role of isolation in the formation of species; and hierarchical models of selection as espoused by Roux and Weismann (discussed in detail in Chapter 3). I noted with special gratification that Kellogg recognized hierarchy as an auxiliary, not a confutation, to Darwinism, for this same contention sets a principal theme of this book.

我很高兴地发现，尽管 Kellogg 的分类方式和命名有所不同，但与我们这里的分类是一致的。他将其时代的众多提议分为「辅助于」自然选择和「替代于」自然选择两类。在那些帮助、扩展、改进或符合达尔文主义精神的辅助方法中，Kellogg 强调了两个主要主题：Wagner、Jordan 和 Gulick 关于隔离在物种形成中作用的研究；以及由 Roux 和 Weismann 提出的选择的层次模型（在第三章中详细讨论）。让我感到欣慰的是，Kellogg 将层次模型视为达尔文主义的辅助，而非反驳，这也正是本书的一个核心主题。

In his second category of confutations, Kellogg identified "three general theories, or groups of theories, which are offered more as alternative and substitionary theories for natural selection than as auxiliary or supporting theories" (1907, p. 262): Lamarckism (inheritance of acquired characters in the form advocated by late 19th century neo-Lamarckians), orthogenesis, and heterogenesis (Kellogg's designation for saltationism).

在 Kellogg 的第二类反驳中，他指出了三种主要的理论，或理论组，这些理论更多是作为自然选择的替代方案，而不是补充或支持。具体包括：拉马克主义（指的是 19 世纪末新拉马克主义者所倡导的获得性状遗传）、定向进化论，以及 Kellogg 所称的「异源生殖」，即跳跃论。

Kellogg's taxonomy works particularly well in evaluating the central principles of Darwinism. His "auxiliaries" aid selection (by addition of other principles that do not challenge or diminish selection, or by expansion of se­lection to other levels); but his "alternatives" confute particular maxims of the minimal commitments for Darwinian logic. The Kelloggian "alterna­tives" all deny the fundamental postulate of creativity for selection by desig­nating other causes as originators of evolutionary novelties, and by relegating selection to a diminished status as a negative force. Each alternative rejects a necessary Darwinian postulate about the nature of variation (see pp. 141–146): Lamarckism and orthogenesis deny the principle of undirected variabil­ity; saltationism refutes the claim that variation must be small in extent.

Kellogg 的分类方法在分析达尔文主义的核心原则方面非常有效。他提出的「辅助原则」通过引入不挑战或削弱自然选择的其他原则，或者将选择的概念扩展到其他层次，从而支持自然选择。然而，他的「替代原则」则对达尔文主义的一些基本信条提出了质疑。Kellogg 的这些「替代原则」否认了选择具有创造性的基本假设，通过指出其他原因是进化新特征的来源，并将选择视为一种次要的、消极的力量。每一个替代原则都否定了关于变异性质的关键达尔文假设（参见第 141-146 页）：例如，拉马克主义和定向进化否认了变异是无方向的这一原则；而突变论则反驳了变异幅度必须很小的观点。

I warmly endorse Kellogg's approach. As practicing scientists, we often do not pay enough respect to the logical structure of an argument — to its rigors and its entailments. We tend to assume that conclusions flow unambiguously from data, and that if we observe nature closely enough, and experiment with sufficient care and cleverness, the right ideas will somehow coalesce or flow into place by themselves. But scholars should know, from the bones and guts of their practice, that all great theories originate by intense and explicit men­tal struggle as well. We should not castigate such efforts as "speculation" or "armchair theorizing" — for mental struggle deserves this designation only when the thinker opposes or disparages our shared conviction that, ulti­mately, empirical work or testing must accompany and validate such exer­cises in thought (and then all scientists would agree to let the calumny fall). Great theories emerge by titration of this basically lonely mental struggle with the more public, empirical acts of fieldwork and bench work.

我非常赞同 Kellogg 的方法。作为科学家，我们往往不够重视论证的逻辑结构 —— 它的严谨性和内在涵义。我们常常认为，只要仔细观察自然，聪明地进行实验，结论就会自然而然地从数据中得出。然而，学者们应该深知，所有伟大的理论都源于激烈而明确的思维挑战。我们不应把这种努力称为「猜测」或「纸上谈兵」，除非这种思考排斥或贬低我们共同的信念，即最终需要通过实证研究或测试来验证这些思维过程（在这种情况下，所有科学家都会同意让这种指责消失）。伟大的理论是在这种基本上孤独的思维挑战与更加公开的实地研究和实验室工作的结合中逐渐成形的。

One need look no further than Charles Darwin for proper inspiration. He rooted his theory in practical testability, and he continually devised and performed clever experiments, despite limited resources (of available equipment and personnel at Down, not of funds; for Darwin was a wealthy man and did not need to spend his time seeking patronage, his generation's equivalent of modern grant swinging). But natural selection did not flow from the external world into a tabula rasa of Darwin's mind. He carried out with himself, as re­corded in his copious notebooks (Barrett et al., 1987), one of the great men­tal struggles of human history — proposing and rejecting numerous theories along his slow and almost painful journey by inches, accompanied by lateral feints and backward plunges, towards the theory of natural selection. That theory, when fully formulated in the 1850's, emerged as an intricately devised amalgam of logically connected parts, each with a necessary function — and not as a simple message from nature. We must treat this theory, as Kellogg does, with respect for its integrity.

如果寻找灵感，那么 Charles Darwin 无疑是一个很好的榜样。他将自己的理论建立在可测试的基础上，即使在设备和人手有限的情况下，也不断精心设计并进行实验。不过，Darwin 并不缺乏资金支持，因为他是个富有的人，不必像现代科学家那样花时间申请科研经费。然而，达尔文的自然选择理论并不是凭空得来的。他通过自己所记录的大量笔记本（Barrett et al.，1987），进行了一场伟大的思想斗争。在这场斗争中，他提出并否定了许多理论，经历了漫长而艰难的过程，时而迂回或后退，最终形成了自然选择理论。到 19 世纪 50 年代，这一理论完整地呈现出来，是一个由逻辑紧密相连的部分组成的复杂体系，而非简单的自然启示。我们应当像 Kellogg 那样，尊重这一理论的完整性。

With the coalescence and hardening of the Modern Synthesis (Gould, 1983b), culminating in the Darwinian celebrations of 1959, orthodoxy descended over evolutionary theory, and a generation of unprecedented agreement ensued (often for reasons of complacency or authority). However, the press of new concepts and discoveries has since fractured this shaky con­sensus, and we now face a range of options and alternatives fully as broad as those available in the contentious decade of Kellogg's review. In this renewed context, I recommend Kellogg's procedure as both intellectually admirable and maximally useful — namely, to arrange and evaluate various views and challenges by classification according to their attitudes towards the minimal commitments of Darwinism. I say "admirable" because such an approach pays proper respect to the intellectual power of Darwin's synthesis, and "use­ful" because taxonomy by minimal commitments of an essential logic allows us to rank, assess, and interconnect an otherwise confusing array of proposals and counterproposals. And just as the widespread debate of Kellogg's time led to the Modern Synthesis of the next generation, I believe that the re­newed arguments of our day will pay dividends in the form of a richer and more adequate consensus for our new millennium. Kellogg's characterization of his own era therefore becomes relevant to our current situation:

随着现代综合理论的形成和巩固（Gould，1983b），在 1959 年的达尔文纪念活动中达到顶峰，进化理论中形成了一种正统观念，出现了前所未有的一致意见（尽管这种一致常常是由于自满或权威造成的）。然而，新概念和新发现的出现打破了这种共识，如今我们面临的选择和替代方案依然广泛，堪比 Kellogg 评论的争议年代。在这样的背景下，我推荐 Kellogg 的方法，因为它在智力上令人钦佩且极为实用 —— 即根据各种观点和挑战对达尔文主义基本原则的态度进行分类和评估。「令人钦佩」是因为这种方法对达尔文综合理论的智力影响给予了应有的尊重，「实用」是因为通过对基本逻辑原则进行分类，我们可以更好地对各种提议和反提议进行排序、评估和关联。正如 Kellogg 时代的广泛辩论催生了下一代的现代综合理论，我相信我们今天的新论争将为新千年带来更丰富、更全面的共识。因此，Kellogg 对他所处时代的描述在我们当前的情境下显得尤为相关。

The present time is one of unprecedented activity and fertility both in the discovery of facts and in attempts to perceive their significance in rela­tion to the great problems of bionomics. Both destructive criticism of old, and synthesis of new hypotheses and theories, are being so energeti­cally carried forward that the scientific layman and educated reader, if he stand but ever so little outside of the actual working ranks of biology, is likely to lose his orientation as to the trends of evolutionary advance. Precisely at the present moment is this modification of the general point of view and attitude of philosophical biologists unusually important and far-reaching in its relation to certain long-held general conceptions of bi­ology and evolution (1907, p. ii).

当前是一个在生物经济学领域中，事实发现和其意义理解方面异常活跃且富有成果的时代。旧理论和假说正受到激烈的批评，新理论和假说的形成也在积极推进。因此，即使是科学的外行或是普通读者，如果稍微脱离生物学的实际工作，也可能对进化发展的趋势感到迷茫。特别是在现阶段，生物学家们的观点和态度的变化，对于一些长期以来的生物学和进化的概念有着重要而深远的影响。（1907 年，第 ii 页）

I have therefore followed Kellogg's lead and attempted, in this introductory chapter, to characterize the central logic and minimal commitments of Darwinism — an essence, if you will, to invoke a good word and concept that has become taboo in our profession. I will then use this characterization as a foundation for classifying various challenges and controversies — just as Kellogg did — according to their stance towards the essential concepts of Darwinism. The most interesting and far-reaching challenges directly engage these essential concepts, either as alternatives to refute them in part, or as auxiliaries to expand and reinterpret them in fundamental ways. This book presents, as its primary thesis, the notion that (i) Darwinism may be viewed as a platform with a tripod of essential support; (ii) each leg of the tripod now faces a serious reforming critique acting more as an auxiliary than an alterna­tive formulation; and (iii) the three critiques hold strong elements in com­mon, and may lead to a fundamentally revised evolutionary theory with a re­tained Darwinian core.

因此，我遵循 Kellogg 的指引，在本章开头试图描述达尔文主义的核心逻辑和基本承诺 —— 可以说这就是其精髓，虽然这个词和概念在我们领域中已变得敏感。接着，我将利用这一描述来为各种挑战和争议分类 —— 如同 Kellogg 所做的那样 —— 依据它们对达尔文主义基本概念的态度来进行分类。最有趣和深远的挑战会直接触及这些核心概念，或作为替代部分地反驳它们，或作为辅助来扩展和重新解释这些概念。本书的主要论点是：(i）可以将达尔文主义视为一个由三脚架支撑的基础平台；(ii）这个三脚架的每个支柱目前都面临严肃的改革性批判，这些批判更多是作为辅助而非替代性方案；(iii）这三种批判有许多共同的强烈元素，可能促成在保留达尔文核心的基础上，对进化理论进行根本性的修订。

We must rank challenges by their degree of engagement with the Darwin­ian core; we cannot follow a strategy of mindless "raw empiricism" towards the Origin and simply compile a list of Darwin's mistakes. All great works are bursting with error; how else could true creativity be achieved? Could anyone possibly reformulate a universe of thought and get every detail right the first time? We should not simply count Darwin's errors, but rather assess their im­portance relative to his essential postulates. (Consider, for example, the stan­dard rhetorical, and deeply anti-intellectual, ploy of politically motivated and destructive critics, American creationists in particular. They just list the mis­takes, envelop each in a cloud of verbal mockery, and pretend that the whole system has drowned in this tiny puddle of inconsequential error.)

我们应该根据挑战对达尔文核心思想的影响程度来进行排序，而不是采取盲目的「原始经验主义」策略，仅仅列出达尔文在《物种起源》中的错误。所有伟大的作品都不可避免地包含错误，因为没有人能够在第一次尝试时就完美无缺地重构一个思想体系。我们应关注的是这些错误在达尔文基本假设中的重要性，而不是简单地数数他的错误。（例如，政治动机的批评者，尤其是美国的创造论者，常常只是一味地罗列错误，用嘲讽的语言加以渲染，假装整个理论体系因为这些微不足道的错误而崩溃。）

I suggest that we use the list of minimal commitments to gauge the status of Darwin's errors. Very few faults of simple fact can, as individual items, be of much consequence unless they confute a core commitment. Darwin argued, for example, that swimbladders evolved into lungs (see p. 107) though ex­actly the opposite occurred — but no premise of the general theory suffers any injury by this mistake, however embarrassing. What about more important theoretical claims like Darwin's hypothesis of "pangenesis" as a mechanism of heredity (Darwin, 1868)? Again, Darwin's view of life would have been easier to vindicate if the theory had been affirmed, but none of his three essen­tial postulates about the nature of variation fell with the disproof of pangen­esis, and the core commitments remained intact, if unproven. What about the impact of major claims that turn out to be basically true, Mendelism for ex­ample? We must make our judgment by assessing their engagement with the core commitments. In the first decade of the 20th century, most evolution­ists invoked Mendelism as a saltational theory of macromutation against the Darwinian core commitment to small-scale variation (see Chapter 5). Later, largely through R. A. Fisher's analysis and the resolution of the Mendelian vs. biometrician debate, macromutations were rejected, "ordinary" small-scale variation granted a Mendelian basis, and Mendelism comfortably reinter­preted as support for the same core commitment. Again, challenges and new proposals must be judged and ranked by their engagement with the essence of a reigning theory. Darwinism embodies a definable set of minimal commit­ments; all great theories do and must.

我建议使用最低承诺的清单来评估达尔文错误的状况。一般来说，简单事实的错误单独来看很少会有重大影响，除非它们直接挑战了学说的核心。例如，达尔文曾提出鱼鳔演化成了肺（见第 107 页），尽管实际上情况正好相反 —— 然而，这一错误并没有损害他的整体理论，尽管让人尴尬。至于更重要的理论主张，比如达尔文提出的「泛生论」作为遗传机制的假设（Darwin，1868），达尔文的生命观即便在这一理论没有被证实的情况下，也没有动摇他的三个关于变异性质的基本假设，核心的思想依然保持完整。对于那些被证明基本正确的重要理论，例如孟德尔主义，我们必须通过评估它们与核心思想的联系来进行判断。在 20 世纪的头十年，大多数进化论者将孟德尔主义视为一种大突变理论，与达尔文关于小规模变异的核心思想相对立（见第 5 章）。后来，主要通过 R. A. Fisher 的分析以及孟德尔派与生物计量学派争论的解决，大突变理论被否定，「普通」的小规模变异被赋予了孟德尔的基础，孟德尔主义被重新解释为支持达尔文的核心思想。同样，新的挑战和建议必须通过它们与现行理论核心本质的关系来判断和排序。达尔文主义包括一组明确的最低承诺；所有伟大的理论都是如此，并且必须如此。

We should use this perspective of engagement with the core commitments to assess the relative theoretical importance of issues now commanding at­tention among evolutionists. For example, Kimura's theory of neutralism (1983) ranks as fundamental and reformative for proposing a new domain of causation at high relative frequency. I regard as unfair, and disrespectful of Darwin's clear commitments, the common rhetorical strategy of arguing, as Stebbins and Ayala did for example (1981), that selection and neutralism should be judged as competing paradigms comfortably embraced within the Modern Synthesis. The Synthesis, as an intellectual structure, has always been understood as Darwinism strengthened by modern knowledge about ge­netics and heredity. The Synthesis must therefore assert a dominant relative frequency for selection. Of course such a theory allows for neutrality — one could scarcely deny either the mathematics or the conditions of potential op­eration — but only at a low relative frequency, so that the preeminence of se­lection will remain unchallenged.

我们可以通过参与核心承诺的视角来评估进化论者当前关注的问题在理论上的相对重要性。例如，Kimura 的中性理论（1983）因为它以高频率提出了一个新的因果领域，被认为具有基础性和革新性。我认为，像 Stebbins 和 Ayala（1981）那样，认为选择和中性理论可以作为在现代综合理论中并存的竞争范式，这种常见的论述策略是不公平的，也不符合达尔文的明确主张。现代综合理论作为一种知识结构，一直被理解为通过现代遗传学和遗传知识强化的达尔文主义。因此，这一理论必须宣称选择具有主导的相对频率。当然，这种理论承认中性现象的存在 —— 无论是数学上的证明还是实际操作条件都无法否认 —— 但这种现象只能在较低的相对频率下出现，以确保选择的优越性不被动摇。

Kimura's claim for high, even dominant, relative frequency of neutral change at the nucleotide level introduces a world different from Darwin's. At most, one can say that this world, largely invisible at the organismic level, does not subvert Darwin's proposal that selection dominates the phenotypic realm of overt form, function, and physiology of organisms. But in so saying, we must admit that a large part of reality, though unaddressed by Darwin himself, cannot be explained on Darwinian principles if Kimura's theory holds. Darwinism does not fall thereby, but a new and distinct domain, pri­marily regulated by a different style of causality, has been added to evolution­ary explanation. How can one deny that evolutionary theory becomes sub­stantially reformulated and enriched thereby? Why would one want to issue such a denial, unless psychic health depends upon the continued assertion of comfortable orthodoxy, whatever the required twist of logic?

木村提出在核苷酸层面上中性变化的频率很高，甚至占主导地位，这与达尔文的理论形成了鲜明对比。尽管如此，我们可以说，这种变化在生物体层面上基本上是不可见的，并没有挑战达尔文关于自然选择主导生物体外在形态、功能和生理的观点。但与此同时，我们也必须承认，如果木村的理论成立，那么有很大一部分现实是达尔文理论无法解释的。达尔文主义并没有因此崩溃，而是进化论中新增了一个主要由不同因果机制控制的新领域。这难道不是对进化论的重大改写和丰富吗？为什么有人会否认这一点呢？除非他们的心理健康依赖于继续坚持令人舒适的传统观点，而不管这需要怎样扭曲逻辑。

My own expertise lies in paleontology, and this book shall emphasize critiques from the attendant domain of macroevolution, descriptively defined as patterns and causes of evolution at and above the species level. (I acknowl­edge, of course, the fascination and transforming power of work at the mo­lecular level. I also recognize that macroevolution must shake hands with mo­lecular genetics in order to forge the new consensus. If this book slights the molecular side, my own ignorance stands as the only cause, and this work necessarily suffers thereby.)

我的专业领域是古生物学，本书将重点探讨宏观进化领域的批评，其描述性定义为物种及以上层次的进化模式和原因。当然，我承认分子层面的研究具有其独特的吸引力和变革力量，也意识到宏观进化必须与分子遗传学携手合作，以达成新的共识。如果本书对分子方面的内容有所忽略，那只能归因于我的无知，因此这项工作可能会因此有所不足。

Basically, I shall defend the view that each leg of Darwin's essential tripod, as explicated in this chapter, now faces a serious critique from the domain of macroevolutionary change. These critiques rank as auxiliaries to Darwin­ism in Kellogg's sense; for they either expand or add to the core commit­ments. But the expansions are large and the additions substantial — so the resulting revision can no longer be called ordinary Darwinism in any conven­tional meaning. I am convinced that the three critiques intertwine in a poten­tially unified way. But consensus is premature and we can only see the result­ing shape of the revised and unified theory through a glass darkly — though in the future, no doubt, face to face.

基本上，我将在本章中捍卫这样一种观点：达尔文理论的核心支柱，现在都面临来自宏观进化变化领域的严肃批评。在 Kellogg 的意义上，这些批评可以看作是对达尔文主义的补充；因为它们要么扩展了，要么增加了其核心内容。不过，这些扩展和补充都很大，以至于修订后的理论已经不再是传统意义上的达尔文主义。我相信，这三种批评可能会以一种潜在统一的方式交织在一起。但目前达成共识还为时过早，我们只能模糊地看到修订和统一后的理论形态 —— 但在未来，毫无疑问，将会更加清晰地展现。

Proceeding in reverse order through critiques of Darwinism's three core claims, catastrophic mass extinction, and more general views about fortu­ity in abiotically driven extinction at all levels, challenge Darwin's essential notion of a dominant relative frequency for biotic struggle in a crowded world — the third leg of the tripod, as represented by the geological stage re­quired for an evolutionary play based entirely on extrapolation of microevolutionary principles (Chapters 6 and 12). The general idea of constraint — more in the positive sense of internally biased channels for change, rather than the negative meaning of limited variation for potentially useful alter­ations (see Gould, 1989a) — rejects the key Darwinian notion of isotropy in raw material, and consequent control of evolutionary direction by natural se­lection. Constraint therefore challenges the second leg of the tripod — the "creativity of natural selection" — not by confuting the proposition that natu­ral selection acts as a creative force, but by insisting on diminished relative frequency and a sharing of control. Moreover, by reasserting the structuralist side of the old dichotomy between structure and function in biology — an is­sue far predating evolution, and inherent in the struggle between continental vs. Paleyan approaches to natural theology — the idea of constraint reengages one of the deepest issues in all the life sciences (Chapters 4–5 and 10–11).

从对达尔文主义三大核心主张的批评开始，包括灾难性的大规模灭绝事件以及无生命因素驱动的不同层次灭绝中的偶然性，这些观点挑战了达尔文的一个基本概念：在拥挤世界中生物斗争的相对频率占主导地位的观点。这是基于微进化原则推演而成的进化舞台的第三个支柱（第 6 章和第 12 章）。约束的概念，更多是指内部变化的偏向通道，而不是限制有用变化的变异性（参见 Gould，1989a），否定了达尔文关于生物材料各向同性的核心思想，以及自然选择对进化方向的绝对控制。因此，约束挑战了三足鼎立的第二个支柱，即「自然选择的创造力」。这并不是否定自然选择作为创造性力量的作用，而是强调其相对频率下降和控制权的共享。此外，通过重申生物学中结构与功能之间古老的对立 —— 这一问题早在进化理论出现之前就存在，并且在大陆派与 Paleyan 自然神学方法的争论中有所体现 —— 约束的概念重新引发了生命科学中最深刻的问题之一（第 4-5 章和第 10-11 章）。

Most importantly, and as the best integrator of all three critiques, the hierarchical theory of natural selection, by asserting both the existence and rela­tive importance of selection at all levels from genes to species, challenges the first leg of the tripod — the insistence, so crucial to Darwin's radical overthrow of Paley via Adam Smith, that selection works almost exclusively on organ­isms (Chapters 3 and 8–9). I believe that this hierarchical theory provides the most fundamental, and potentially unifying, of all critiques — for I suspect that many constraints will be explained as effects of lower level selection indi­rectly expressed in phenotypes; while the contribution of mass extinction to repatterning life's history will include a crucial component of selection at lev­els above the organismic. Moreover, the attendant need to reconceptualize trends and stabilities not as optimalities of selection upon organisms alone, but as outcomes of interactions among numerous levels of selection, implies an evolutionary world sufficiently at variance from Darwin's own conception that the resulting theory, although still "selectionist" at its core, must be rec­ognized as substantially different from current orthodoxy — and not just as a dash of spice on an underflavored dish. I therefore devote the largest section of this book's second half (Chapters 8 and 9) to defining and defending this hierarchical theory of selection.

最重要的是，作为整合三种批评的最佳方案，自然选择的层次理论提出，从基因到物种的各个层面上都存在选择，这些选择的相对重要性挑战了传统观点。传统观点认为，选择几乎完全作用于个体生物（参见第 3 章和第 8-9 章），这是达尔文通过亚当·斯密推翻帕雷思想的关键所在。我认为，这一层次理论提供了最基础且可能具有统一性的批评观点 —— 因为我怀疑，许多限制可以解释为低层次选择在表型中的间接表现；同时，大规模灭绝事件对生命历史的重塑也包含了超越个体生物层面的选择因素。此外，我们需要重新思考进化趋势和稳定性，不仅仅视其为对个体生物选择的最优结果，而是看作是多个选择层面相互作用的结果。这种观点与达尔文的原始概念有显著差异，因此，即便新理论在核心上依然是「选择主义」的，也必须承认其与当前的正统理论有实质性不同，而不是仅仅为原有理论增添些许新意。因此，我在本书的后半部分（第 8 和第 9 章）中，着重定义和捍卫这种选择的层次理论。

If the next generation of evolutionists follows and extends this protocol at the outset of our new millennium, as presaged by the tentative work and ex­ploration of so many scientists at the close of the last millennium, then we shall honor, all the more, the vitality of the tight definitions and firm commit­ments proposed by Darwin himself at the foundation of our discipline. Few theories hold the range of power, and the intricacy of logic, necessary to gen­erate an intellectual structure of such continuing fascination and relevance. We do not pay our proper respect to Darwin by bowing before the icons of his central propositions, but by engaging these focal precepts as living pres­ences, ripe for reformulation, almost 150 years after their initial presentation. In Darwin's own world of continuous flux, anything that lasts so long be­comes a many-splendored thing. In a revised world of structuralism, we might say that Darwin first located and embellished one of the few brilliant and coherent positions in an intellectual universe with few nucleating places. Either formulation engenders the same result of abiding respect for Darwin's view of life — leading to proper thanks owed by all of us for the good fortune of such an interesting founder. What greater pleasure can we know than to engage Darwin in dialogue — as we can and must do, because his theory rests upon a powerful and defining essence. Darwin, in short, is the extraordinary man who, all by himself, embodied the only three beings proclaimed worthy of respect by Baudelaire — for he pulled down an old order, and came to know a large part of the new world that he created. Il n'existe que trois etres re­spectables: le pretre, le guerrier, le poete. Savoir, tuer, et creer. There exist only three beings worthy of our respect: the priest, the warrior, and the poet. Know, kill, and create.

如果新一代的进化论者在我们这个新千年的开端，能够遵循并扩展在上个千年末期众多科学家所进行的初步研究和探索，那么我们就会更加珍视达尔文当初在我们学科基础上提出的精确定义和坚定信念。很少有理论能够具备如此强大的影响力和复杂的逻辑，以建立一个持续吸引并相关的知识体系。我们对达尔文的尊敬，不在于盲目崇拜他的核心观点，而在于将这些重要原则视为有生命力的存在，经过近 150 年的发展，仍然可以被重新审视。在达尔文那个不断变化的世界里，任何能够长久存在的事物都变得更加丰富多彩。在一个经过修正的结构主义世界中，我们可以说达尔文首先发现并完善了在一个智力世界中为数不多的精彩而连贯的观点之一。无论哪种说法，都让我们对达尔文的生命观念怀有深深的敬意 —— 这也使得我们对这样一位令人钦佩的创始人心怀感激。与达尔文对话是极大的乐趣 —— 因为我们可以并且必须这样做，因为他的理论拥有强大且决定性的核心。简而言之，达尔文是那个卓越的人，他独自一人体现了波德莱尔称之为唯一值得尊重的三种身份：牧师、战士和诗人。他推翻了旧的秩序，并掌握了他所创造的新世界的大部分。Il n'existe que trois etres respectables：le pretre，le guerrier，le poete. Savoir，tuer，et creer. 只有三种存在值得我们尊重：牧师、战士和诗人。了解、杀戮和创造。
