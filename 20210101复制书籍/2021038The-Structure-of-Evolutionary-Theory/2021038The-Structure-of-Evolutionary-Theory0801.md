## 0801Species as Individuals in the

Hierarchical Theory of Selection





The Evolutionary Definition of Individuality





AN INDIVIDUALISTIC PROLEGOMENON





The perceived excesses of the French Revolution may have sapped English enthusiasm for the tenets of Enlightenment Rationalism — the faith of Darwin's grandfather Erasmus. The subsequent romantic movement stressed opposite themes of emotion vs. logic, and national variety vs. universal reason. Charles Darwin, who revered his grandfather but also loved Wordsworth's poetry, re­ceived a firm grounding in both great philosophical and aesthetic traditions. He also — and perhaps as a direct result — maintained strong fascination for a central theme common to both movements, but for different reasons: the role of individuals as agents of change in larger systems. (The Enlightenment focussed on individuals as effective intellectual agents and inherent bearers of rights — “unalienable” in Jefferson's memorable phrase — and therefore as pri­mary causal and moral agents in themselves, not as expendable items of a larger collectivity. The Romantics exalted individual effort as the motive force of social change through the actions of occasional heroes of higher sen­sibility.)

In any case, and whatever the deeper source, we do know that, as Darwin stitched together his theory of natural selection in 1838, he centered his ma­jor intellectual struggle in the few weeks before his “Malthusian” insight (Schweber, 1977) upon the role of individuals as primary causal agents of evolutionary pattern, even at largest scales (see full discussion in Chapter 2). He first studied the economic theory of Adam Smith through the major sec­ondary source then available — Dugald Stewart's On the Life and Writing of Adam Smith. He expressed special fascination for Smith's distinctive notion that the overall optimality of an economy might best (and paradoxically) is fostered by allowing individuals to maximize personal profit without re­straint (the doctrine known ever since as laissez faire, or “let do” — more roughly, “leave 'em alone”). He then read an extensive analysis of the work of the great Belgian statistician Adolphe Quetelet — particularly his central notion of I'homme moyen (average man), based on the aggregation of indi­vidual attributes into collectivities.

In the context of this conscious and directed search, we should not be surprised that Darwin's theory of natural selection rests upon the same central paradox that fueled Adam Smith's system: postulate a cause based on individ­uals ruthlessly pursuing their own benefits; an ordered polity will then arise as an incidental side consequence. No dismissal of Paley's omniscient God as the direct creator of general order could possibly have been more incisive, or more radical. We can therefore understand why Darwin insisted so strongly upon a single-level theory of natural selection — with struggle among individ­ual bodies as a virtually exclusive locus of causality (see Chapters 2 and 3 for extended analysis). The downward shift of agency, from a purposively benev­olent deity to the amoral self-interest of organisms, embodies the most dis­tinctive and radical aspect of Darwinism.

Given Darwin's intense and conscious desire to restrict causality to compet­ing organisms, I have been particularly struck, in researching and writing this book, by the inability of all-the most diligent, and most thoughtful, early selectionists to make such a system work fully and consistently — despite in­tense and clearly focussed efforts to “cash out” Darwin's vision. As discussed in Chapters 3 and 5, only two early evolutionists fully grasped the meaning of natural selection, and the logic behind Darwin's restriction to the level of or­ganisms. The first, August Weismann, defended Darwin's system with utmost zeal, as he spoke with pride about the Allmacht (all-might, or omnipotence) of natural selection. He began by advocating rigid adherence to Darwin's level of organisms. But, in fighting the resurgent Lamarckism of late 19th cen­tury thought, Weismann had to descend a notch to postulate important “ger­minal selection” at the level of hereditary units. Late in his career, he recog­nized the logical generality enjoined by his admission of a second locus — which selection can work on objects with requisite properties at any level of the genealogical hierarchy. Weismann therefore articulated a fully hierarchical model of selection operating at several levels both below and above individ­ual organisms. Moreover, he developed this full theory not in retreat or as a hedge, but as a compelling extension of selection's central logic — and as fur­ther testimony to an Allmacht even more inclusive.

The second, Hugo de Vries, postulated a macromutational mechanism that logically precluded the production of new species by gradual selection of intrapopulational variation. In so doing, he committed intellectual parricide against his personal hero, Charles Darwin — and this mental act caused him great psychological distress. He assuaged his feelings of guilt, and showed his understanding of the abstract logic of selection, by insisting that he remained loyal to Darwinism — but at a higher level of selection among species, rather than among organisms (see pp. 446–451).

We must also not neglect the man who had invested the most effort in holding the line at organismal selection, and who had the most to lose if such a restriction could not work — Charles Darwin himself. Darwin struggled mightily to bring all evolutionary phenomena, including a host of apparently exceptional items from hymenopteran colonies to prevention of interspecific hybridization, under the umbrella of organismic selection, often with truly ingenious formulations — and he ultimately failed, as all others had. The logic of his argument led Darwin to postulate higher-level selection at two crucial points (see pp. 127–137) — to explain the evolution of altruism in human so­cieties by interdemic selection, and to encompass multiplication of species un­der his essential “principle of divergence” by a partial appeal to species selec­tion. If none of the most rigorous and savvy early Darwinians could render evolution without some appeal to selection at levels higher than individual organisms, shall we not tentatively conclude that both the logic of the theory and nature's empirical record compel such an expansion, and the attendant notion of hierarchy?





THE MEANING OF INDIVIDUALITY AND THE EXPANSION OF THE DARWINIAN RESEARCH PROGRAM





We may agree with the strictest formulation of agency in Darwinian theory: natural selection works by a struggle (actual or metaphorical) among individ­uals for personal reproductive success. In other words, selection occurs when properties of a relevant individual interact with the environment in a causal way to influence the relative representation of whatever the individual con­tributes to the hereditary make-up of future generations. If we place the theory's causal focus so squarely upon individuals as agents, then we might suppose that Darwin's unitary perspective must apply: all results at all evolu­tionary scales must cascade from the causal process of selection among indi­viduals, defined in the conventional vernacular manner as the bodies of or­ganisms.

But, as Hamlet said of the fears that prevent suicide (an adaptation, some would no doubt argue, for keeping humans viable as Darwinian agents), “ay, there's the rub.” What is an individual? Are vernacular bodies the only objects in nature that merit such a designation — especially when discrete “bodiness” doesn't always define an unambiguous individual at the focal level of Darwin's intent (not to mention the difficulties encountered in trying to characterize entities at levels above and below bodies in the genealogical hierarchy of nature)?

For example, biologists spent more than a fruitless century trying to decide whether the parts of siphonophores are “persons” in a colony or organs of an organism — only to recognize that the question cannot be answered because both solutions can justly claim crucial and partial merit (see Gould, 1984d). Are grass blades or bamboo stalks bodies in their own right (as some aspects of functional organization suggest), or parts (called ramets) of a larger evolu­tionary individual (called a genet)? Do our feelings about definition shift when ramets become spatially discrete and therefore look just like conven­tional bodies — as in the parthenogenetic offspring of an aphid stem-mother (designated, in their totality, as a single El, or evolutionary individual, by Janzen, 1977)? And what shall we do with discrete bodies that maintain some genetic variation among themselves (and cannot, therefore, form a set of identical ramets), but operate together as differentiated items (analogs of organs) in a larger “totality” like a beehive or ant colony with a single queen? Wilson and Sober (1989) have urged a revival for the old concept of “super-organism” in such circumstances.

As so much uncertainty surrounds the issue of how we define an “individ­ual” at the supposedly unambiguous level of Darwin's own intent, we should not be surprised that attempts to restrict the concept to organic bodies have yielded more confusion than resolution. Perhaps we should try a different and more general approach. Perhaps we should attempt to specify a set of minimal properties required to designate an organic entity as an “individ­ual” — and then ask whether any objects at levels above or below traditional bodies possess these properties, and therefore qualify for inclusion under an expanded concept of individuality. If so, we might obtain a useful definition divorced from the happenstances of scale, and therefore sufficiently general to provide a deeper (and clearer) understanding for this central concept in Darwinism.

This subject has generated an enormous and often confusing literature throughout the history of Darwinian thought — and more so than ever before during the past twenty years. Some colleagues may wish to throw up their hands and brand the entire enterprise with labels usually invoked pejoratively by scientists — merely “semantic” or “philosophical.” Indeed, several of the finest contemporary philosophers of science have devoted considerable at­tention to this issue — see, for example and in alphabetical order, Brandon (1982), Hull (1980), Lloyd (1988), Sober (1984), and Wimsatt (1981). But I believe that both the volume and the confusion arise for two reasons that compel primary attention to the subject: the issue is both exceedingly difficult and enormously important.* The best scholars tend to gravitate to the most fascinating and portentous questions — and the confluence of extensive con­sideration by the most prominent philosophers of science (as mentioned above) and the most thoughtful evolutionary biologists from early days (Dar­win, Weismann, de Vries, as discussed above) to current times cannot be accidental or wrong-headed. As a testimony to this current concern, and again in alphabetical order, I cite as a small sample: Arnold and Fristrup (1982), Dawkins (1976, 1982), Eldredge (1985a), Fisher (1958), Ghiselin (1974a and b), Leigh (1977), Lewontin (1970), Maynard Smith (1976), Stan­ley (1975, 1979), Vrba (1980; Gould and Vrba, 1982; Vrba and Gould, 1986), Williams (1966, 1994), D. S. Wilson (1983), and Wright (1980). Col­laborations between philosophers and biologists have also added to the inter­est (for example, Wilson and Sober, 1994; Sober and Wilson, 1998; Lloyd and Gould, 1993; Gould and Lloyd, 1999).

Discussion of this most difficult and most important subject may be orga­nized in a hundred different ways. I have chosen a point of entry that may seem peculiar or indulgent as an abstract philosophical question tenuously re­lated to the “real” biology of organic objects: are species individuals or classes? As a twofold justification for this strategy, I found, first and person­ally, that I could best organize this material and place all subjects into logical sequence, if I started here and worked systematically outward through a par­ticular net of implications. (Others, no doubt, would choose different begin­nings and construct just as sensible and comprehensive a sequence.) Second and collectively, this particular philosophical question has been widely and passionately discussed in the biological literature, and has struck several sci­entists (e.g. Eldredge, 1995) as a potential centerpiece unwisely relegated to a peculiar periphery by many scholars.

In 1974, Michael T. Ghiselin published an article in Systematic Zoology under a title that I found insufferably self-indulgent at the time (especially since his manuscript directly followed my own densely empirical article on lo­cal geographic variation in the land snail Cerion bendalli on the Bahamian is­land of Abaco), but have since come to view as adequately justified: “A radi­cal solution to the species problem.” In short, Ghiselin argued that many classical problems about species (not primarily or especially related to this chapter's topic of levels in selection) could be instantly resolved if we — in the Pauline manner of “scales falling from the eyes” — reversed our customary definition of species as classes (or universal categories that can “house” ob­jects) and reconceptualized them instead as individuals (or particular things). A species then becomes a singular item — an evolutionary entity defined by both a unique historical genesis and a current particular cohesion.

I will not trace the large and complex trail that Ghiselin's proposal gener­ated in the scientific and philosophical literature (see, for example, Ghiselin, 1987). In my reading and understanding, I do not think that any clean resolu­tion can be stated, or even any consensus described. Perhaps we might best acknowledge, with Mayr (1982a and b), that the term “species,” as conven­tionally used and understood, includes statements about both classes and in­dividuals. In this sense, the extensive discussion of Ghiselin's proposal sharp­ened our thinking, but provided no closure.

In another sense, however, and following a common (largely sociological) pathway in science, the explicit airing of such an interesting theme launched, or at least impacted in major ways, a substantial set of theoretical issues, in­cluding two of central importance to this book: the nature of evolution as a historical discipline, and the definition of individuality as crucial to the “units of selection” problem. In his initial article, Ghiselin (1974b, p. 543) dimly perceived the key implication for hierarchical selection if species be con­strued as individuals rather than classes, and selection (by Darwin's defini­tion) works on individuals — namely, that selection must also operate among species-individuals (and, by extension, potentially at several levels in a hierar­chy of units, each properly construed as an “individual”). But Ghiselin did not complete his argument and grant full evolutionary individuality to spe­cies. “Species are units, and they have evolutionary importance, but the same may be said of organisms. Doubtless both organisms and species specialize. And probably organisms become adapted but species do not, except in so far as they consist of adapted organisms” (Ghiselin, 1974b, p. 543).

David Hull (1976), in the first major philosophical extension of Ghiselin's proposal, firmly linked the concept of species as individuals to the older is­sue of units (or levels) of selection, thus properly tying the rationale for a causal theory of hierarchical selection to the generalization of Darwin's key insight that selection can only operate by the differential reproductive success of “individuals”: “Entities at various levels of organization can function as units of selection if they possess the sort of organization most clearly exhib­ited by organisms: and such units of selection are individuals, not classes” (Hull, 1976, p. 182). In his important later article — the locus classicus of the pivotal distinction between “replicators” and “interactors” (see next section of this chapter) — Hull then added (1980, p. 315): “Individuality wanders from level to level, and as it does, so too does the level at which selection can occur.”

If the rationale for a hierarchical theory of selection resides in the expan­sion of “individuality” to several levels of biological organization (see Gould and Lloyd, 1999), then we must specify a set of criteria that any material con­figuration must meet to merit designation as an “individual.” We may, I think (see Gould, 1994), most usefully divide these criteria into two categories: (1) requirements in ordinary language for granting individuality to any configu­ration (vernacular criteria); and (2) requirements in Darwinian theory for re­garding any entity as an evolutionary individual, or potential agent of selec­tion (evolutionary criteria). (I trust that, despite a traditional ethos contrary to such an admission, all thoughtful and self-introspective scientists no longer feel threatened or disloyal in acknowledging that all definitions must be the­ory laden — see Kuhn, 1962, for the classic statement.)

We must also resolve one other terminological confusion before listing the criteria of individuality. What word shall we use as a general term for the dis­crete “thing” that can serve as a unit of selection at various hierarchical lev­els? In an important article, a manifesto for reviving interest in the power of group selection and the validity of the hierarchical model in general, D. S. Wilson and E. Sober (1994) suggest that we use the term “organism” for the generality (and therefore speak of “species organisms,” “gene organisms,” and so forth), while restricting the word “individual” to organic bodies (you, me, the oak tree, and the barnacle) at the conventional level of Darwinian concern. They choose this definition because they emphasize — I would say overemphasize (see Gould and Lloyd, 1999) — functional cohesiveness among their general criteria of “thingness,” a property better captured by “organ­ism” than by “individual” in vernacular English.

I strongly urge the opposite and more conventional solution. This issue, I fully recognize, only concerns words, not the empirical world. But we get so muddled, and waste so much time, when we fail to be clear about words and definitions — especially when various scholars use the same word in different, or even opposite, ways — as in the classic confusion generated when molecu­lar biologists began to use “homology” for the percent of similarity in genetic sequence between two organisms, rather than for the well-established and en­tirely different concept of joint possession due to common ancestry. Fortu­nately, in this case, we evolutionists have apparently managed to persuade our molecular colleagues to respect conventional usage, and to call their im­portant concept “sequence similarity,” or some such.

No one would create such a muddle on purpose, but this particular confu­sion already exists — and some common ground must therefore be established if we wish to address this growing and important literature without a peren­nial need to stop, translate, and bear linguistic idiosyncrasies continually in mind whenever we read a paper. At the moment, most authors use “organ­ism” for the Darwinian body (me and thee), and “individual” for the general­ized unit of selection at any hierarchical level — while others (like Wilson and Sober) employ reversed definitions.

I strongly urge the former course — organisms as conventional vernacular bodies, and individual for the generalized term — for two reasons. First, this decision represents more common usage, both in vernacular English and among biologists. (Several academic departments include the phrase “organismic biology” in their title to defend a continuing focus on entire bodies against molecular claims for hegemony. But if genes are organisms as well, this ploy will not work!) Second, the technical definition of an “individual” in academic philosophy, and the spread of this terminology in the large litera­ture inspired by Ghiselin's arguments for species as individuals (summarized above), grants priority to “individual” as the general term, and “organism” as the restricted body. Ghiselin (1974b, p. 536) clearly defended this usage in his original definition: “In logic, 'individual' is not a synonym for 'organism.' Rather, it means a particular thing.” And Hull (1976, p. 175) explicitly la­beled the application of “organism” to higher-level objects as misleading because vernacular language so strongly equates “organism” with discrete bodies. He then urged “individual” as the general term, as advocated here: “From the point of view of human perception, organisms are paradigm indi­viduals. In fact, biologists tend to use the terms 'organism' and 'individual' interchangeably. Thus, biologists who wish to indicate the individualistic character of species are reduced to terming them 'superorganisms.' The same claim can be expressed less misleadingly by stating that both organisms and species are individuals.”

In discussing criteria of individuality, I will focus on species as paradigms for higher-level evolutionary entities for two reasons: (1) because I believe that a proper theory of macroevolution, the central concern of this book, rests upon such a proposition; and (2) because species seem so maximally un­like discrete “things” to many biologists, thus making the correction of this false impression a prerequisite for accepting the full hierarchical model of se­lection. But species can claim no favored status in the hierarchical model, and I use them here only as an example — so that the argument may then proceed to a full set of levels, each characterized by a valid kind of individual acting in a distinctive way.





Criteria for vernacular individuality


When we apply the term “individual” in ordinary English, we envisage a set of properties centered upon uniqueness, discreteness, functionality, and cohe­sion considered both spatially and temporally. To be a unique “thing,” and not just a part of a continuum, a named object must clearly begin and end — and must remain its definable self throughout a continuous existence. We may, I think, best summarize this intuition in three criteria. To be called an in­dividual, a material entity must have:

• a discrete and definable beginning, or birth;

• an equally discrete and definable ending, or death; and

• sufficient stability (defined as coherence of substance and constancy of form) during its lifetime to merit continuous recognition as the same “thing.”



I realize, of course, that the third criterion amalgamates several crucial notions into a single statement. We might specify at least four properties in­volved in our ordinary concept of “sufficient stability” for individuality:

Change. An individual may undergo some, even substantial, change during its lifetime, but not so much either to become unrecognizable or to en­courage redefinition as a different thing — and, particularly, for temporal se­quences of individuals, not so much alteration that late stages come to resem­ble the next-named individual in a sequence more than the early stages of the same individual.

Discreteness and cohesion. An individual must maintain clear and coherent boundaries during its lifetime. Parts should not “ooze out” into other individuals, while components of other individuals should not enter and become incorporated.

Continuity. An individual cannot fade in and out of existence during its lifetime, but must maintain material continuity throughout. Members of classes, on the other hand, are not so constrained, for classes are defined by common properties, not by historical continuity. As Hull (1980) argues, the class of gold atoms does not require continuity or filiation. If all gold disap­peared, its position on the periodic table would remain — and an element later reconstituted with the right atomic particles and requisite properties would still, and legitimately, be called gold. But if all peacocks die, the species-indi­vidual Pavo cristatus disappears forever. Even if some human engineer retained an electronic record of the entire Pavo cristatus genome, and future technology permitted chemical reconstitution from nucleotides, we couldn't call the resurrected creature a member of Pavo cristatus, even if the reconsti­tuted object looked and acted like an extinct peacock of old.

Functionality, or organization. We expect that, at least in some crucial ways, the parts of an individual will work together so that the individ­ual functions in a distinctive and cohesive way. This criterion, though crucial as we will see to the second set of evolutionary criteria, may be the least im­portant (perhaps even dispensable) for vernacular definitions. If a bounded object maintained all the other listed properties, but failed to do anything as an entity (and acted, instead, largely as a repository of separate parts), we would still call the object an individual, however inert and uninteresting.

Conventional organisms certainly possess all these properties — as well they must, for the bodies of complex animals established our vernacular Western paradigm for the general concept of individuality. Yet note that, even here, at the point of maximal clarity, some fuzziness and indefiniteness plague every criterion. Consider human bodies, the inevitable exemplar of the paradigm. Our lives have reasonably discrete beginnings — but if a true moment could be defined without ambiguity, then our social and political debates about abor­tion would require new terms and engage different issues. Death might seem even more definable and momentary — but, again, fuzziness and ambiguity plague our definitions, leading to complex, and often heart wrenching, medi­cal and legal wrangles. Perhaps our bodies pass the criterion of “sufficient stability” with more clarity. We don't fuse with others, or rise again from the dead (at least in a material world that science can adjudicate). We are cer­tainly designed to operate discretely, even if our actions be dysfunctional. All our chemicals, and most of our cells, undergo periodic replacement — but I re­main myself and continue to look sufficiently like my baby pictures (though not much like my early embryonic form with tail and gill slits!).

So organisms surely pass muster as individuals. But we encounter prob­lems, including several classic issues subject to endless discussion in the litera­ture, when we try to assign individuality at other (particularly higher) levels of the organic hierarchy. For example, the standard objection to interdemic selection (see pp. 648–652) holds that too many demes fail the criterion of “sufficient stability” — for they may not persist long enough to matter in evo­lution, and their borders may be too “leaky” as organisms move in and out in the absence of reproductive isolation between the parts (organisms) of differ­ent demes. All too frequently, demes may operate, in Dawkin's apt metaphor (1976, p. 36), “like clouds in the sky or dust storms in the desert . . . tempo­rary aggregations or federations.”

Defenders of classical “group” (i.e. interdemic) selection recognize these problems of course, and all workable models have been purposely con­structed to overcome such objections by specifying conditions that will per­mit demes to fulfill the defining criteria listed above. In fact, the classical em­pirical issue of our literature on group selection asks whether demes can “hold together” long and discretely enough so that the differential prolifera­tion and survival of some denies vs. others can propel the general increase of an “altruistic” allele (promoting demic success), even while the allele's fre­quency declines within groups as “selfish” alternatives prevail in conven­tional natural selection among bodies. If demes can “hold together” by this operational criterion of evolutionary outcomes, then they possess “sufficient stability” to be regarded as individuals on functional grounds within selec­tionist theory.

Traditionally, biologists have not been willing to imbue species with these requisite criteria for individuality. Species, in an argument dating to both Lamarck and Darwin, have often been construed as mere names of conve­nience attached to segments of evolving continua without clear borders. Un­der this gradualistic and anagenetic view (see Fig. 8-1), a species near the end of its arbitrary existence must be phenotypically more similar to a forthcom­ing descendant than to the initial ancestor. (Indeed, under strict gradualism, we even face the definitional absurdity that the last generation of an ancestor should be reproductively isolated from its own offspring — that is, the first generation of a new descendant. Some creatures may eschew such incest on moral or adaptive grounds, but no one would gainsay the biological possibil­ity.) Thus, on this traditional view, species cannot maintain sufficient tempo­ral stability to be called individuals. In addition, species do not have discrete birth points if they branch from their ancestors at rates no different from characteristic tempos of transformation during their subsequent anagenetic lifetimes (see Fig. 8-1). At most, some species display clear termination in extinction (but others evolve gradually to descendants.) Thus, species do not function as good vernacular individuals if gradualism and anagenesis pervade the history of life.

Even so — or as long as most species arise by splitting of lineages rather

than by wholesale transformation, no matter how gradual the tempo of branching — the individuality of species may be maintained in some technical sense, though only by violation of our vernacular intuitions. After all (see Fig. 8-2), so long as branching points (or fuzzy intervals) can be temporally lo­cated at all, then species do have definable intervals of existence, and can be individuated on this basis, even if their life courses violate our usual notions about sufficient morphological stability.

Many evolutionary biologists have failed to recognize that the so-called cladistic revolution in systematics rests largely upon this insistence that spe­cies (and all taxa) be defined as discrete historical individuals by branching (leading to the rule of strict monophyly) — and not as classes with “essential” properties by appearance (leading to the acceptance of paraphyletic groups). Many biologists reject (and regard as nonsense) the cladistic principle that no species name can survive the branching off of a descendant — and that both branches must receive new names after such an event, even if the ancestral line remains phenotypically unchanged. But this counterintuitive rule makes sense within cladistic logic — for cladists define new entities only as products of branching (the word clade derives from a Greek term for branch). A trans­forming species that does not branch cannot receive a new name even if the final form bears no phenotypic resemblance or functional similarity to the original ancestor. Thus, if such extensive transformation occurs in un-branched lineages, a cladist, by failing to designate a truly different anatomy with a distinctive name, retains the technical individuality of species at the price of a severe assault against legitimate intuition.

Can we find any solution to this dilemma? Must we either deny that species can be viewed as individuals, or else accept a logically “pure” definition based on branching, but strongly in violation of vernacular usage? I suggest that this issue can be resolved empirically, and need not persist as a defini­tional or philosophical conundrum. If gradualism and anagenesis prevail in

nature, then all the aforementioned problems cannot be avoided and apply in force. But suppose, as Eldredge and I have long argued in our theory of punc­tuated equilibrium (see Chapter 9), that gradualistic anagenesis occurs only rarely in nature, and that the great majority of species remain essentially sta­ble throughout their geological lifetimes. (Our concept of stasis recognizes that species fluctuate mildly throughout time, to an extent no different from ordinary geographic variation among demes of a species at any one moment, but we hold that mean values of phenotypes generally do not change in a cu­mulative or directional manner.) Suppose also that species, on geological scales, branch in unresolvable “moments.” (In nearly all-geological circum­stances, single bedding planes amalgamate the events and accumulated results of several thousand years.) If species tend to originate in thousands to tens of thousands of years — that is, with glacial slowness by the inappropriate crite­rion of a human lifetime in potential observation — and then to persist in sta­sis for millions of years, their origin becomes instantaneous in geological time, and species arise as discrete individuals at this proper macroevolutionary scale. Of course, some fuzziness must attend the origin of a species, for we acknowledge that macromutational beginnings in leaps of a single generation rarely, if ever, occur. But when “fuzziness” occupies only a thou­sand years in a million — that is one tenth of one percent of later existence in stasis — then geological indefiniteness surely does not exceed even the relative duration of the fuzziness (9 months in some 80 years) attending the embryo-logical beginning of human personhood!

Under punctuated equilibrium, the remaining criterion of discrete death achieves even clearer definition — for nearly all species disappear by extinc­tion (“living on” only through their progeny of daughter species with new names and individualities), and not by gradual bodily transformation into something else. Species deaths, at geological scales, are surely more discrete and “momentary” than human deaths scaled against the lengths of our life­times.

In summary, then, species that originate by branching can be individuated even under the assumption that gradualistic anagenesis prevails during the history of most species lifetimes (but only by violating our vernacular concep­tion of “personhood” or individuality). However, if punctuated equilibrium prevails as an empirical proposition (see Chapter 9 for defense of this conten­tion), then species are individuals — in some cases much “better” individuals than conventional bodies of organisms — by all vernacular criteria. Under punctuated equilibrium, species originate at points of birth with initial fuzzi­ness confined to an insignificant (usually unmeasurable) moment properly scaled against later existence in stasis. They experience even clearer moments of death, for nearly all species terminate by true extinction and not by trans­formational passage into a descendant that vernacular (non-cladistic) usage will wish to recognize with a different name (a phenomenon called “pseudo-extinction” by paleontologists). And species surely maintain “sufficient sta­bility” during their geological lifetimes by all criteria outlined on page 602. They remain discrete by reproductive isolation (conventionally cited, ever since Buffon, as the chief criterion of “specieshood”). They function as a unit and persist continuously. Above all, they do not change substantially in phenotype — the crucial concept of stasis. Surely, the average species in stasis un­dergoes less temporal change (with less directionality) than human bodies experience in our passage from babyhood through adult vigor and into senes­cence. If humans retain discrete personhood through all these slings and ar­rows of ontogeny, then species (under punctuated equilibrium) function as equally good or even better individuals by the same criteria of vernacular definition.

In describing exceptions and fuzzinesses in the application of these vernac­ular criteria to organisms, and acknowledging that species face the same dif­ficulties of definition, Hull (1976, p. 177) wrote: “However, exactly the same questions arise for both. If organisms can count as individuals in the face of such difficulties, then so can species.” But Hull assumed that these common problems plague species far more intensely than they threaten organisms. I would suggest that the opposite situation may prevail in nature: species may be even better individuated than organisms when punctuated equilibrium ap­plies (and we consider species at their appropriate scales of geological time). This issue unites these two chapters in a crucial link between the theory of punctuated equilibrium (Chapter 9) and the classical debate about “units” or “levels” of selection (Chapter 8) — a conjunction that underlies my views on the importance and validation of macroevolutionary theory.

Interestingly, albeit through a glass darkly, Hull (1976) grasped the logical link between the phenomenology of punctuated equilibrium and the defini­tion of species as individuals in his first important paper on this subject — even though he had not, by this time, encountered our empirical and theoretical arguments for such a pattern (Eldredge, 1971; Gould and Eldredge, 1971; Eldredge and Gould, 1972). (In his more inclusive review of 1980, Hull then explicitly joined our particular claims to the defense of species as individuals.) Hull begins by stating the problem (1976, p. 185): “Earlier I described indi­viduals as reasonably discrete, spatiotemporally continuous and unitary enti­ties individuated on the basis of spatiotemporal location rather than similar­ity of some kind. But one might object that species lack these characteristics. For example, in most cases new species arise gradually.”

Hull then recognized that some neontological models of speciation acceler­ate the rate of branching relative to the supposedly standard rate of anagene­sis within species — and that such an acceleration will sharpen the definability of species by the criterion of discrete birth: “But there are processes in nature which serve to narrow the boundaries between ancestral and descendant spe­cies ... The end result is that the number of organisms intermediate between the ancestral and descendant species is reduced considerably” (1976, p. 185). Finally, Hull stresses the important point that all individuation, at any ap­propriate scale, entails some fuzziness at the boundaries — and that species therefore need not be construed as “worse” individuals than bodies (1976, p. 185). “If processes similar to those just described are common in nature, then the boundaries between ancestral and descendant species can be narrowed considerably, though not to a one-dimensional Euclidean line. But, of course, the replication of organisms does not happen instantaneously either. If absolutely discrete boundaries are required for individuals, then there are no individuals in nature. It is only our relative size and duration which make the boundaries between organisms look so much sharper than those between species.”

But, to continue the Euclidean metaphor, and using an appropriate ruler with (say) a minimally noticeable geological increment equal to 10,000 years, the boundaries of many species do become momentary under punctuated equilibrium. Stasis persists for a long run of increments. At a commonly ob­served duration of 5 to 10 million years for marine invertebrate species in the fossil record (Raup, 1985; Stanley, 1985), one thousand increments of stasis would represent the geometry of a species lifetime, while even a million for the much shorter average duration of terrestrial mammalian species yields 100 increments. By comparison, many (probably most) events of speciation unroll within a single increment — leading to abrupt and momentary origin at geological scales, and the right-angle convention that has become stan­dard for plotting the emergence of species under punctuated equilibrium (see Fig. 8-3).





Criteria for evolutionary individuality


The vernacular criteria discussed above provide necessary, but obviously insufficient, conditions for identifying an entity as an evolutionary “individual” with the capacity to act as a causal agent in a process of Darwinian selection. Most unambiguous vernacular individuals cannot operate as Darwinian ac­tors. The earth, for example, surely merits designation as a well-defined indi­vidual — with a specifiable birth (perhaps attended by some initial fuzziness as a primordial fireball), sufficient stability over billions of years (including enough climatic homeostasis to provide a stage for the history of life), and a forthcoming rapid death (presumably by absorption after the sun burns out some five billion years from now, and expands in diameter at least to the orbit of Jupiter). But the earth remains “infertile” in the crucial Darwinian sense of reproductive potentiality. Planets do not have children, and therefore cannot function as Darwinian individuals.

I do not cite this example to win an argument by ridicule, but rather to emphasize, once again, that all definitions must be embedded within theories. Mere vernacular individuality does not suffice for identification as a causal actor in Darwinian theory. Evolutionary individuality (or, more strictly, Dar­winian individuality, for different theories of biological change may entail other criteria) requires an additional set of attributes rooted in two features of Darwin's world: the genealogical basis of evolution as a branching tree, and the causal efficacy of selection as the leading process of evolutionary change.

Reproduction. Darwinian individuals must be able to bear children. Biological evolution is defined as a genealogical process. Darwinian evolution operates by the differential increase of your progeny (or whatever you pass into future generations) relative to the progeny of other individuals within the larger entity of your membership.

Inheritance. Your children must, on average, be more like you than like other parents of your generation — so that evolution may proceed by the differential increase of your own heritable attributes (a requirement of Dar­winian systems, not of all conceivable evolutionary mechanisms). In other words, a principle of inheritance must prevail to permit the tracing of genea­logical patterns — so that the relative reproductive success of ancestors may be assessed.

Variation. This criterion lies so deeply, and so fundamentally, within the constitution of Darwinism as a revolutionary ontology (and not just as a theory of evolution), that we should, perhaps, not even list variation as a sep­arate criterion, but merely state that this conception underlies all Darwinian thinking. We can hardly imagine a more radical restructuring of the material

world than the Darwinian shift to variation among members of a popula­tion as an ultimate and irreducible reality (see Mayr, 1982b; Gould, 1996a) — a reversal of the old Platonic notion that essences (approximated empiri­cally by measuring mean values, or by trying to construct an abstract ideal form and then searching for a closest actual embodiment) define the nature of things, and that variation among actual individuals (organisms in pop­ulations, in our most relevant example) can only be construed as “acci­dental,” and judged by relative departure from a materially unattainable ideal.

Heredity and reproduction work in concert with variation to empower Darwinian selection in genealogically recognizable lineages. The failure of any criterion debars Darwinian evolution as a genealogical process. An ab­sence of reproduction, for example, enforces an oddly limited form of “evolu­tion” restricted to rules (or vagaries) of change within one or a number of in­dividuals, all separately constructed at the outset. Vernacular usage, in fact, does apply the term “evolution” to some nongenealogical systems of this sort — as in the “evolution” of stars along the H-R sequence. But the causes of such systematic temporal changes, unfolding predictably under laws of nature (and not by the contingencies of variational history), differ so pro­foundly from Darwinian evolution that we really should insist upon different words for these maximally disparate modes of history (Gould, 2000a). (A great burden of misunderstanding, in both popular and professional cultures, must be ascribed to our confusing use of common terminology for such dif­ferent causes. Many interested laypeople feel that biological evolution must unfold by internal necessity just as stars follow their predictable sequences and as galaxies expand following the big bang. And many professional evolu­tionists, suffering from the common affliction of physics envy, and immured in the reductionistic biases of Western scientific culture, have tried to find pro­gressive patterns directly imposed by natural law, where Darwinian contingency actually reigns.)

An absence of variation also stymies Darwinian change by eliminating the raw material or substrate for any selective mechanism. Evolution in non-varying populations might be treelike and genealogical, but such a process could not be Darwinian. One would have to imagine some very unearthlike way to generate change and diversity — for example, random dispersal of ini­tially identical creatures to varying environments, followed by a Lamarckian or directly inductive process of heritable environmental stamping upon all members of a population.

Variation without heredity (that is, an absence of correlation between properties of offspring and parents) also stymies Darwinian causality. Selec­tion could occur in a single generation. That is, the biggest or the ugliest might outreproduce all others, or even ruthlessly murder all small and beauti­ful conspecifics — but to what evolutionary avail, if the offspring of survivors then reconstitute all the original variation in original proportions? If varia­tion occurred without correlation to parental constitution, but with inherent bias in a given direction — so that even random mortality produced a trend — then evolution would occur. But we have always labeled such styles of internally directed change as non-Darwinian, with Lamarckism as a primary and historically most influential example.

Interaction. At each level, the varying individuals of an evolving population (organisms of a deme, demes of species, species of a clade) must interact with the environment in such a way that some individuals achieve relatively greater reproductive success as a causal result of heritable properties manifested by these fitter, and not manifested (or not as effectively expressed) by less fit individuals. This causal claim embodies the key feature of natural selection as an active process. In other words, we must be able to devise a testable causal scenario about why the differential possession of certain heri­table properties yields increased reproductive success.

These statements inevitably engage the crucial issue of whether we should define selection by this causal interaction of individuals and environments, or by the product actually transmitted to future generations (see next section). The logic of Darwinism dictates that the form of heredity's product — how­ever fascinating in variety across nature's scales — cannot specify agency of selection. Interaction with environment defines agency (Lloyd and Gould, 1993; Gould and Lloyd, 1999) — and agents must be individuals (by both ver­nacular and evolutionary criteria). Some interacting individuals (like genes) usually pass faithful copies to the next generation. Others (like species) pass inevitably modified copies that are still more like themselves than like any other individual at their level. Still others (like sexual organisms) disaggregate their personhood and pass hereditary pieces and particles.

All these different strategies for hereditary passage permit us to recognize interacting individuals as causal agents of Darwinian selection. The special and unusual tactic of sexual organisms may seem curiously indirect (and we all know the enormous and confusing literature devoted to this subject), but disaggregation works as well as relatively faithful passage, so long as the es­sential Darwinian imperative remains in force: that is, so long as selectively successful individuals manage to bias the next generation with relatively more of their own hereditary material — however that material be passed or packaged. The “goal” of natural selection cannot be defined by faithful repli­cation, but rather by relative “plurifaction,” or “more-making.”* The indi­vidual that plurifies by increasing the percentage of its contribution to the he­redity of the next generation (however the units or items of heredity be constituted) gains in the evolutionary game. And we call the game Darwinian if plurifaction occurs by a causal interaction between properties of the suc­cessful individual and its environment.

As for the vernacular criteria previously discussed (see pp. 602–603), these specifically evolutionary criteria teach us that organisms are not the only individuals capable of acting as units of Darwinian selection. In particular, and continuing to use species as a “type” example of individuality at higher lev­els, all evolutionary criteria apply to the species as a basic unit of macro-evolution. Species have children by branching (in our professional jargon, we even engender these offspring as “daughter species”). Speciation surely obeys principles of hereditary, for daughters, by strong constraints of homology, originate with phenotypes and genotypes closer to those of their parent than to any other species of a collateral lineage. Species certainly vary, for the defining property of reproductive isolation demands genetic differentiation from parents and collateral relatives. Finally, species interact with the envi­ronment in a causal way that can influence rates of birth (speciation) and death (extinction).

As a further benefit for thus codifying the criteria of evolutionary individuality, we can immediately cut through the foolishness surrounding several dis­tressingly common, but artlessly and rather thoughtlessly contrived, claims (or, rather, loose metaphors) about the Darwinian character of large items in nature — an attractive idea for many people, particularly for romantics and “new-agers” who yearn for meaningful agency at the highest levels. We can dismiss these claims because the object hypothesized as an agent of selec­tion fails several crucial requirements for designation as an evolutionary in­dividual. As an obvious example, many proponents of the so-called Gaia hypothesis wax poetic about the earth and atmosphere as a homeostatic system robustly balanced by interaction with life to secure and stabilize the conditions required by organisms for diversification and geological persis­tence. Supporters often assume that such functional coherence must make the earth sufficiently like an organism to merit designation as a living entity. Some have even stated that the earth must therefore be recognized as the larg­est and most inclusive product of Darwinian selection — or even that the earth should, in fact, be viewed as a true Darwinian individual. This woolly notion confuses a gut feeling about functionality or adaptive “optimality” (for sup­port of life) with the requirements of Darwinian agency. The earth does not generate children, and did not arise by competitive prowess as the sole survi­vor among defeated brethren (who must have died or been expelled, I suppose, from the solar system long ago). Therefore, among a plethora of other rea­sons, the earth cannot be construed as a Darwinian agent or unit of selection.

More plausibly, and more interestingly, communities and ecosystems have sometimes been designated as potential units of selection. In this instance, at least, a case could be conceived — for communities do maintain some func­tional coherence, some boundaries (however loose), and some potential for splitting off “daughter” communities with sufficient resemblance to a parent. But I can hardly imagine a set of circumstances that would allow such ecolog­ical units to express enough criteria of individuality to qualify for Darwinian agency. Communities are not (for the most part) genealogically constructed or filiated. They can rarely maintain sufficient coherence or persistence, for constituent species move in and out in relative independence. Williams (1992, p. 55) writes, for example: “The reason must be that communities lack the necessary high rates of reproduction and replacement and especially the high level of heritability required for effective selection. They change their make­up so rapidly that selection among communities must be overwhelmed by en­dogenous change.”

But these principled exclusions leave us with a rich hierarchy of legitimate biological individuals, all related by the fascinating property of nested inclu­sion within evolution's genealogical system. In appropriate circumstances, broad enough for vital agency in the evolution of life on earth, individuals at many levels — including genes, cell lineages, organisms, demes, species, and clades — can act as units of Darwinian selection. I doubt that we can defend any longer — or as any more than a convenient and parochial preference based on the happenstances of size and duration for a human body — the cen­tral Darwinian conviction that organisms represent the fundamental level of Darwinian individuality, with all other levels either nonexistent, impotent, entirely subservient, or operating only in odd and restricted circumstances.





The Evolutionary Definition of Selective Agency and the

Fallacy of the Selfish Gene





A FRUITFUL ERROR OF LOGIC





Science thrives upon the continuous correction of error. Most errors arise from inadequate knowledge of the empirical world, or (if grounded in a theo­retical prejudice) at least persist because we have no means (conceptual or technological) to secure their empirical refutation. For example, we once lacked the technology to prove that buried organic matter might petrify, and that wood made of stone might therefore represent the remains of ancient plants, and not the power of rocks to mimic organic design by a process anal­ogous to crystallization.

Only rarely, however, do professions get sidetracked by pursuing an exten­sive and long-lasting program of research initiated by an error in reasoning rather than an inadequacy of empirical knowledge. Yet I think that the gene-centered approach to natural selection — based on the central contention that genes, as persistent and faithful replicators, must be fundamental (or even ex­clusive) units of selection — represents a purely conceptual error of this un­usual kind. In beginning with Williams's manifesto (1966) — based on a mode of thinking rooted in the brilliantly consistent, if limited, worldview of R. A. Fisher (1930), but immediately inspired by the remarkable work of W. D. Hamilton (1964) — and proceeding through the codification of Dawkins (1976), to numerous works both popular (especially Cronin, 1991) and tech­nical (Dennett, 1995), this gene-based approach to selective agency has in­spired both fervent following of a quasi-religious nature (see R. Wright, 1994), and strong opposition from many evolutionists, who tend to regard the uncompromising version as a form of Darwinian fundamentalism resur­gent (see Gould, 1997'd), variously designated as ultradarwinism (Eldredge, 1995) or hyperdarwinism.

I shall show in this section that, while genes may be appropriately desig­nated as fundamental replicators (under a defendable but nonexclusive strat­egy of research), replicators simply aren't units of selection or, for that matter, causal agents at all under our usual notions of mechanism in science. The misidentification of replicators as causal agents of selection — the foundation of the gene-centered approach — rests upon a logical error best characterized as a confusion of bookkeeping with causality.

We fall into another serious fault of reasoning when we accept the common conceptual taxonomy that relegates error itself to a purely negative category of unfortunate blunder. Some errors do lead only to blind alleys and wasted time. But others, as thoughtful scientists have always recognized, serve as es­sential prods and directors of progress through correction. Darwin's famous words, distinguishing harmful from salutary error, have frequently been cited in this context: “False facts are highly injurious to the progress of science, for they often endure long; but false views, if supported by some evidence, do lit­tle harm, for every one takes a salutary pleasure in proving their falseness” (from the Descent of Man). I prefer the stronger statement of the great Italian economist, Vilfredo Pareto: “Give me a fruitful error any time, full of seeds, bursting with its own corrections. You can keep your sterile truth for your­self.”

During my career in evolutionary science, no error has proven more fruit­ful in Pareto's sense than the gene-centered approach to selection. The central claim, clearly expressed, forced us to reconceptualize the entire domain of evolutionary causality. The outrageous character of such an ultimate reduction compelled us to rethink our subject by explicitly rejecting the oldest, most traditional and entirely commonsensical notions about our own bodies as agents. (Yet the reductionistic cast of the theory fit so well with conven­tional ideas about the goals of science that many biologists “caught the spirit” and “followed the program” despite its assault upon ordinary intu­ition.) Nevertheless, the theory could not work. However stubborn and he­roic the attempt, explanation inevitably faltered upon the central logical er­ror — especially when selection had clearly worked upon emergent properties of higher-level individuals, and no verbal legerdemain could recast the story in terms of genes as causal agents. If “Pareto errors” contain the seeds that burst their own boundaries, then such uncommon errors of fallacious reason (rather than absent fact) qualify best for this status. Empirical correction usu­ally requires a period of waiting for new technologies or new discoveries (as the sources of resolution do not lie within the argument), but logical errors al­ways carry the seeds of correction within the fruit of their own structure.





HIERARCHICAL VS. GENIC SELECTION





The fallacy of gene selectionism, and the consequent validity of the alternative (and opposite) hierarchical model of selection, can best be expressed in a series of seven arguments and vignettes — of different length, but all con­nected in a logical order, and all developed for the same import and purpose:





The distinction of replicators and interactors

as a framework for discussion


Both leading founders of modern gene selectionism as a general view of evo­lution (Williams, 1966; Dawkins, 1976) drew a crucial distinction between reproductive units of heredity, and entities that interact with the environment to bias the transmission of reproductive units into the next generation. Wil­liams viewed nearly all evolution as proceeding via genes as reproductive units, with adaptation of organisms (the interacting entities) construed as a result — a duality that he usually labeled (1966, p. 124 for example) as “genie selection and organic adaptation.” Dawkins (1976) agreed entirely, and drew a more colorful and explicit distinction between “replicators,” considered as units of selection and identified as genes — and “vehicles,” considered as merely passive repositories built by replicators for their own purposes, and identified as bodies of organisms. In other words, both Williams and Daw­kins invoked a criterion of replication to identify genes as the active and fun­damental agents of natural selection.

In his 1980 review on “Individuality and selection,” David Hull formalized this distinction in a manner that has — quite usefully and properly in my view — organized the professional discussion on units of selection ever since. Hull (1980, p. 318) defined a replicator as “an entity that passes on its struc­ture directly in replication”; and an interactor as “an entity that directly in­teracts as a cohesive whole with its environment in such a way that repli­cation is differential.” Hull then defined selection with reference to both attributes: “a process in which the differential extinction and proliferation of interactors cause the differential perpetuation of the replicators that pro­duced them.”

Hull insisted that a causal account of selection must include both concepts (1980, pp. 319-320): “Evolution of sorts could result from replication alone, but evolution through natural selection requires an interplay between replica­tion and interaction. Both processes are necessary. Neither process by itself is sufficient. Omitting reference to replication leaves out the mechanism by which structure is passed from one generation to the next. Omitting reference to the causal mechanisms that bias the distribution of replicators reduces the evolutionary process to the 'gavotte of the chromosomes,' to use Hamilton's propitious phrase.” Later, Hull (1994, pp. 627-628) continued to espouse this view: “According to the terminology I prefer, there are no units of se­lection because selection is composed of two subprocesses — replication and interaction. Selection results from the interplay of these two subprocesses. Genes are certainly the primary (possibly sole) units of replication, whereas interaction can occur at a variety of levels from genes and cells through or­ganisms to colonies, demes, and possibly entire species.”

I shall argue in this section that the causality of selection resides in interaction, not in replication, and that the hierarchical model almost automatically prevails once we accept this analysis of causality. Moreover, Hull's intuitions ran in this direction from the start, for even while he insisted upon the “rele­vancy” of both replication and interaction, Hull always acknowledged that the classical argument for multiple levels of selection only invokes interactors. He wrote in his original paper (1980, p. 325): “In most cases when biologists argue that entities more inclusive than single genes function in the evolutionary process, they have interaction in mind.” And Hull (1994, p. 628) directly followed his defense of duality (quoted just above) with this sentence: “The units-of-selection controversy concerns levels of interaction, not levels of replication.” I shall defend and develop Hull's intuition in the rest of this section. Only interactors can be deemed causal agents in any cus­tomary or reasonable use of this central term. Replicators are important in evolution, but in a different role as items for bookkeeping. Replicators are not causal agents. If causality resides in interactors, and interactors at several levels rank as legitimate evolutionary individuals, then the hierarchical theory of selection becomes unassailable as a coherent logical structure, subject to the ultimate scientific test of empirical verification (or invalidation) in nature.





Faithful replication as the central criterion for the gene-centered

view of evolution


As noted above, both Williams and Dawkins chose to define units of selection as replicators rather than interactors. I shall explain under argument three why I am confident that they made the wrong choice — thus committing the fruitful “Pareto error” discussed at the outset of this section. Having thus de­cided, and correctly understanding that selection can only work on “individ­uals” as previously defined, what replicating individuals would Williams and Dawkins then designate as units?

We all know that they chose genes as fundamental — and effectively exclusive — replicators, and therefore as the unit of selection in Darwinian the­ory (in maximal contrast with the hierarchical theory of multiple, simultaneously acting levels, as defended in this book). I will discuss the stated reasons for their choice, but I cannot know the deeper motivations of their philosophical and psychological preferences. I strongly suspect that they, and all defenders of strict gene selectionism, feel drawn to the traditional reductionism of science. They understood that Darwin himself went as far as he could in this direction, by breaking down the Paleyan edifice of highest-level intentionality (God himself) to the lowest level then practical — organisms struggling for reproductive success (see Chapter 2). They also recognized that this breakdown had produced revolutionary consequences for Western thought, particularly in reconceptualizing all perceived natural “benevo­lence” (especially the good design of organisms and the harmony of ecosys­tems) as a side-consequence of struggle for personal success among lowest-level individuals, rather than as an explicit intention of a loving and omnipo­tent deity. I imagine that the more thoughtful gene selectionists then worked by analogy, reasoning that if they could break causality down even further, below the level of the organism, similarly interesting, and perhaps revolution­ary, consequences might follow. I can't gainsay either the intuition or the am­bition — but I can fault the resulting argument for an erroneous choice of both category and of level.

If a search for ultimate reduction below the Darwinian body set the deeper motivation for choosing genes as units of selection, what particular rationales did proponents of this theory offer? Both Williams and Dawkins began by arguing that the conventional unit of Darwinian theory — bodies of organ­isms — cannot properly occupy this role because organisms lack a key feature that genes possess. The bodies of sexual organisms disaggregate in reproduc­tion, making only half an appearance (so to speak) in the genetic constitution of offspring. How can something so ephemeral be a unit of selection? But genes pass faithful copies of themselves into future generations, and therefore maintain the integrity required of an agent of natural selection in their defini­tion.

Both Williams and Dawkins advance the same argument in three steps: (1) the unit of selection must be a replicator; (2) replicators must transmit faith­ful, or minimally altered, copies of themselves across generations; (3) sexual organisms disaggregate across generations and therefore cannot be units of selection, but genes qualify by faithful replication. Williams developed this argument in his first book (1966), and continues his verbal defense to this day, despite remarkable movement, as we shall see, towards the position ad­vocated in this volume. But Williams still employs the language of gene-selectionism, particularly in the identification of genes as “units of selection” by virtue of faithful replication (so different from Hull's pluralistic view that the definition of a unit must include both replication and interaction): “These complications are best handled by regarding individual [i.e. organismic] se­lection, not as a level of selection in addition to that of the gene, but as the primary mechanism of selection at the genic level. Because genotypes do not replicate themselves in sexual reproduction (cannot be modeled by dendrograms), they cannot be units of selection” (Williams, 1992, p. 16).

Dawkins (1978) advances the same argument, with the same designation of genes as units of selection: “However complex and intricate the organism may be, however much we may agree that the organism is a unit of function, I still think it misleading to call it a unit of selection. Genes may interact, even 'blend' in their effects on embryonic development, as much as you please. But they do not blend when it comes to being passed on to future generations.”

In a later book (1982, p. 91), Dawkins affirms the terminology of genes as units of selection, by making a strong link to his favorite subject of adapta­tion: “The whole purpose of our search for a 'unit of selection' is to discover a suitable actor to play the leading role in our metaphors of purpose. We look at an adaptation and want to say, 'It is for the good of...' Our quest... is for the right way to complete that sentence ... I am suggesting here that, since we must speak of adaptations as being for the good of something, the correct something is the active, germ-like (sic, but clearly a misprint for the intended 'germ-line') replicator.”

Dawkins's extended defense of genes as the unit of selection invokes a set of related criteria bearing unmistakable concordance with primal virtues of our culture, another extrascientific reason for the argument's appeal — namely, faithfulness, (near) immortality, and ancestral priority. Dawkins enlarges the basic argument about faithfulness — sexual organisms disaggregate across generations but genes transmit accurate copies — into a paean about genetic immortality compared with the tragic transiency of our personal lives:

It does not grow senile; it is no more likely to die when it is a million years old than when it is only a hundred. It leaps from body to body down the generations, manipulating body after body in its own way and for its own ends, abandoning a succession of mortal bodies before they sink in senility and death. The genes are the immortals, or rather; they are defined as genetic entities, which come close to deserving the title. We, the individual survival machines in the world, can expect to live a few more decades. But the genes in the world have an expectation of life, which must be measured not in decades but in thousands and millions of years. In sexually reproducing species, the individual is too large and temporary a genetic unit to qualify as a significant unit of natural selec­tion. The group of individuals is an even larger unit. Genetically speak­ing, individuals and groups are like clouds in the sky or dust storms in the desert. They are temporary aggregations or federations. They are not stable through evolutionary time (1976, p. 36).



Dawkins then commits one of the classical errors in historical reasoning by arguing that because genes preceded organisms in time, and then aggregated to form cells and organisms, genes must therefore control organisms — a con­fusion of historical priority with current domination (see Chapter 11, and Gould and Vrba, 1982, for a full discussion of this common fallacy). But Dawkins's argument collapses for many reasons, most notably the issue of emergence. A higher unit may form historically by aggregation of lower units. But so long as the higher unit develops emergent properties by nonadditive interaction among parts (lower units), the higher unit becomes, by definition, an independent agent in its own right, and not the passive “slave” of control­ling constituents. In advancing this false argument, Dawkins closes with a statement that can only compete with some choice Haeckelian effusions for the title of purplest prose passage in the history of evolutionary writing:

Replicators began not merely to exist, but to construct for themselves containers, vehicles for their continued existence. The replicators which survived were the ones which built survival machines for themselves to live in ... Survival machines got bigger and more elaborate, and the pro­cess was cumulative and progressive ... Four thousand million years on, what was to be the fate of the ancient replicators? They did not die out, for they are past masters of the survival arts. But do not look for them floating loose in the sea; they gave up that cavalier freedom long ago. Now they swarm in huge colonies, safe inside gigantic lumbering robots, sealed off from the outside world, communicating with it by tortuous in­direct routes, manipulating it by remote control. They are in you and me; they created us, body and mind; and their preservation is the ultimate ra­tionale for our existence. They have come a long way, those replicators. Now they go by the name of genes, and we are their survival machines (1976, p. 21).



One might dismiss this rhetorical flourish as harmless enthusiasm. But we must also recognize that, however extended the metaphors, Dawkins's images do accurately express his false theory of selective agency — for if genes can be depicted as exclusive units of selection, then they become the causal agents of evolution; and if bodies are Darwinian ciphers both for their transiency and by their lethargy relative to the “lean and mean” genes living within, then bodies might as well be described as inert and manipulated repositories (“lumbering robots”).

Dawkins writes in his introduction (1976, p. ix): “We are survival ma­chines — robot vehicles blindly programmed to preserve the selfish molecules known as genes. This is a truth, which still fills me with astonishment. Though I have known it for years, I never seem to get fully used to it.” I can only re­gard this honest admission as a striking example of the triumph of false con­sistency over legitimate intuition.





Sieves, plurifiers, and the nature of selection: the rejection of

replication as a criterion of agency


The linkage of selective agency to faithful replication has been urged with such force and frequency that the argument now functions as a virtual man­tra for many evolutionary biologists. But when we consider the character of natural selection as a causal process, we can only wonder why so many peo­ple confused a need for measuring the results of natural selection by counting the differential increase of some hereditary attribute (bookkeeping) with the mechanism that produces relative reproductive success (causality). Replica­tors cannot be equated with causal agents (unless they also happen to be interactors, for only interactors can be agents). Units of selection must be ac­tors within the guts of the mechanism, not items in a calculus of results.

Genes struck many people as promising units for a twofold reason that does record something of vital evolutionary importance, but bears little rela­tionship to the issue of selective agency. Persistence and replication do lie among the necessary (but not sufficient) criteria for calling any biological en­tity an evolutionary individual. Since evolution requires hereditary passage, and since genes transmit faithful copies of themselves, and also represent the smallest functional unit of physical continuity between generations of sexual organisms (the kind of individuals we know best for obvious parochial rea­sons), many biologists assumed that genes must therefore act as the basic (or even the only) unit of selection.

This interesting error arises from two common fallacies in human rea­soning:

The confusion of necessary with sufficient conditions. We all agree that units of selection must be evolutionary individuals in Dar­winian theory — and that status as an evolutionary individual depends upon a set of criteria discussed on pages 602–613. These criteria do include hereditary passage and sufficient persistence — the properties most strikingly exhib­ited by genes. But evolutionary individuals, to act as units of selection, must also display other properties that genes do not generally possess. In particu­lar, a unit of selection must interact “directly ... as a cohesive whole with its environment in such a way that replication is differential” — to quote Hull's definition once again (1980, p. 318).

But in sexual organisms, and in other higher-level individuals, genes do not usually interact directly with the environment. Rather, they operate via the organisms that function as true agents in the “struggle for existence.” Organ­isms live, die, compete and reproduce; as a result, genes move differentially to the next generation.

Of course genes influence organisms; one might even say, metaphorically to be sure, that genes act as blueprints to build organisms. But such statements do not substantiate the critically necessary claim that, therefore, genes inter­act directly with the environment when organisms struggle for existence. The issue before us — the venerable problem of “emergence” — is largely philo­sophical and logical, and only partly empirical. Genes would interact directly only if organisms developed no emergent properties — that is, if genes built or­ganisms in an entirely additive fashion, with no nonlinear interaction among genes at all. In such a situation, organisms would be passive repositories, and genes could be construed as units of selection — for anything done by organ­isms could then be causally reduced to the properties of individual genes.

This aspect of the question must be decided empirically. But the issue is also quite settled (and was never really controversial): organisms are stuffed full of emergent properties; our sense of organismic functionality and intentionality largely arises from our appreciation of these emergent features. Thus, since genes interact with the environment only indirectly through selection upon organisms, and since selection on organisms operates largely upon emergent characters, genes cannot be units of selection when they function in their customary manner as faithful and differential replicators in the process of or­dinary natural selection among organisms. Dawkins's metaphors of selfish genes and manipulated organisms may be colorful, but such images are also fatefully misleading because Dawkins has reversed nature's causality: organ­isms are active units of selection; genes, while lending a helping hand as archi­tects, remain stuck within these genuine units.

The theory-bound nature of concepts and definitions. We are drawn to the faithfulness of gene replication, especially when com­pared with the contrasting transiency of sexual organisms, who must disag­gregate to reach the next generation. We might therefore assume that genes become primary candidates for units of selection as a consequence of their potential immortality, while organisms fall from further consideration by the brevity of their coherent lives.

“Sufficient stability” surely ranks as an important criterion for the “evolu­tionary individuality” required of a “unit of selection.” But, in Darwinian theory and the search for units of selection, “sufficient” stability can only be defined as enough coherence to participate as an unchanged individual in the causal process of struggle for differential reproductive success. To be causal units under this criterion, organisms need only persist for the single genera­tion of their lifetimes — as they do. This endurance may not strike us as a long time in some intuitively appealing psychological sense, or relative to the per­sistence of faithful gene replicates, or considered in comparison with geologi­cal scales — but these temporal frameworks are irrelevant to the question and theory at hand. Organisms last long enough to act as units of selection in a Darwinian process; they therefore possess the “sufficient stability” required of evolutionary individuals.

Of course, evolutionary individuals must all be able to pass — differentially and in a heritable manner — their favorable properties into future generations. But no aspect of this requirement implies or requires that units of selection must pass copies of themselves, bodily and in their entirety, into the next gen­eration. The criterion of heredity only demands that units of selection be able to bias the genetic makeup of the next generation towards features that se­cured the differential reproductive success of parental individuals. Units of se­lection only need to plurify their own representation in the next generation; they need not copy themselves. Sexual organisms happen to plurify by disaggregation and subsequent differential passage of genes and chromosomes. Other kinds of individuals, including genes, asexual organisms and species, plurify more coherently. This common confusion of plurifaction with faithful replication has erected a serious stumbling block to proper understanding of the hierarchical theory of selection.

We can best clarify this crucial issue of the relationship between selective agency and criteria of faithful replication vs. plurifaction if we drop, for a moment, the conventional framework of replication vs. interaction, and re­turn instead to a different metaphor commonly invoked during 19th century debates about the nature of Darwinism and natural selection — namely sieves.

We may use the classical metaphor of sieving to illustrate the inappropriateness of faithful replication as a criterion for defining units of selection. The “goal” of a unit of selection is not unitary persistence (faithful replication) — and I can't quite figure out why so many late 20th century Darwinians ever tried to formulate the concept in this manner. The “goal” of a unit of se­lection is concentration by plurifaction — that is, the differential passage of “youness” into the next generation, an increase in relative representation of your heritable attributes (whether you pass yourself on as a whole, or in disaggregated form, into the future of your lineage).

In the favored metaphor of Darwin's day, selection works like a sieve laden with all the individuals of one generation. Surrounding environments shake the sieve, and particles of a certain size become concentrated, while others pass through the webbing (lost by selection). Sieving represents the causal act of selection — the interaction of the environment (shaking the sieve) with varying individuals of a population (particles on the sieve). As a result of this interaction, some individuals live (remain on the sieve), while others die (pass through the sieve) — and survival depends causally upon variation in emer­gent properties of the particles (in this simplest case, large particles remain, and small particles pass through to oblivion).

The surviving particles need to reproduce in genealogical systems of evolutionary individuals. They may do so by fissioning (faithful passage) or by disaggregation and reconstitution of new individuals as mixtures of heredi­tary parts of previous individuals. The individuals of the old generation even­tually die and evaporate. The individuals of the new generation now live on the sieve, waiting for the next shake.

But this specification of the varied modes for constituting new individuals does not represent what we mean by selection. An entity must be able to re­produce to be defined as an evolutionary individual, but this entity need not replicate faithful copies of itself. Rather, it needs to be able to plurify — that is, to increase, relative to other individuals, the representation of its hereditary contribution to the next generation. Integral “you” may be disaggregated in the process, but so long as the next generation contains a relative increase in your contributions, and so long as you operated as an active causal agent of the Darwinian struggle while you lived, then you qualify as a unit of selection (and a winning unit in this case).

An interesting episode in the history of Darwinism clarifies this concept in a striking manner. We all know that Darwin accepted the idea of “blending inheritance,” or the averaging of parental characteristics in the offspring of sexual reproduction. Now blending inheritance marks an ultimate denial of half in breeding degrades faithful replication — for the hereditary basis of any selected character with an average individual. A paradox therefore arises. If units of selection must be faithful replicators, and if Dar­win both understood natural selection and believed in blending inheritance, then why did he ever imagine that selection could work as a mechanism?

We can only resolve this conundrum by recognizing that faithful replica­tion is not — and never was — the defining characteristic (or even a necessary property) of a unit of selection. Darwin, even given his belief in blending in­heritance, could view sexual organisms as primary units of selection because he understood agency in a different way that remains valid today: units of se­lection are evolutionary individuals that interact with the environment and plurify as a causal result. We may return to the metaphor of sieving. Natural selection can work under blending inheritance because shaking the sieve fa­vors the possessors of advantageous traits in each generation — for any indi­vidual with a phenotype biased in the favored direction gains a better chance of remaining on the sieve. The offspring of the most favored individuals will blend substantially back to the mean, but this style of inheritance only slows the process of selection — for, as a result of differential survival and reproduc­tion in each generation, the mean itself still gradually moves in the favored di­rection.





Interaction as the proper criterion for identifying units of selection


The aforementioned arguments about sieves, plurifaction, and the inappropriateness of faithful replication for designating units of selection lead to a simple conclusion: we can only understand the causal nature of selection when we recognize that units of selection must be defined as interactors, not as replicators. Hull's distinction has great merit, but he fell into an overgenerous pluralism in arguing that identification of causal agency must include statements about both the faithfulness of replicators and the potency of inter-actors. Individuals need not replicate themselves faithfully to be units of se­lection. Rather, they must contribute to the next generation by hereditary pas­sage, and they must plurify their contributions relative to those of other individuals. But the contributions themselves can be wholes or parts; faithful replicates or disaggregated bits of functional heredity. Selection demands plurifaction, not faithful replication.

The simple observation of plurifaction — the relative increase of an individual's representation in the heredity of subsequent generations — does not suffice to identify the operation of natural selection, for plurifaction can occur by nonselective means, and phenotypes can increase in frequency but then be unable to plurify. Consider the primary example of each phenomenon. First, individuals may plurify by accidents of genetic drift. Suppose that individuals fall through the sieve of selection at random, but survivors show increased frequency of certain heritable traits by accident. These surviving individuals will plurify, but they have not operated as active units of selection. Second, in­dividuals may increase in frequency for phenotypic reasons unrelated to he­redity. Suppose that large individuals remain differentially on the sieve, but that individuals grow larger than average for purely ecophenotypic reasons uncorrelated with any aspect of heredity that can pass to subsequent genera­tions. Large phenotypes have increased in frequency for causal reasons — but they will not be able to plurify because they cannot bias the heredity of subse­quent generations.

So selection demands plurifaction because evolutionary individuals must maintain lineages by hereditary passage, and selection occurs by increase in relative representation. But plurifaction can only represent a necessary condi­tion, not a cause. We define selection as occurring when plurifaction results from a causal interaction between traits of an evolutionary individual (a unit of selection) and the environment in a manner that enhances the differential reproductive success of the individual. Thus, and finally, units of selection must, above all, be interactors. Selection is a causal process, not a calculus of results — and the causality of selection resides in interaction between evolu­tionary individuals and surrounding environments. The study and documen­tation of group and higher-level selection has been stymied and thrown into disfavor by our confusion over these issues — and especially by the blind alley of a logically false argument that identified replicators rather than interactors as units of selection, and then constructed a fallacious, reductionistic theory, precisely opposite in structure to the hierarchical model, by specifying genes (because they replicate faithfully) as ultimate or exclusive units of selection. In this context, I note with delight that group selection has risen from the ashes to receive a vigorous rehearing (Sober and Wilson, 1998, for a full treatment; Lewin, 1996, for a popular account under the title “Evolution's new heretics”; and Gould and Lloyd, 1999, for resolution of a final logical problem). This potent revival rests upon two proposals that, as centerpieces of this book, could not gain my stronger assent: the identification of evolutionary individuals as interactors, causal agents, and units of selection; and the validation of a hierarchical theory of natural selection based upon a prin­cipled understanding that evolutionary individuals exist at several levels of organization — including genes, cell lineages, organisms, demes, species, and clades.

D. S. Wilson has most vigorously championed this revival (Wilson, 1980, 1983), while his collaboration with philosopher E. Sober has produced a particularly important paper and a subsequent book on the subject (Wilson and Sober, 1994, with 33 accompanying commentaries and the authors' re­sponse; Sober and Wilson, 1998). Wilson and Sober anchor their argument by insisting that units of selection must be defined as interactors, not rep­licators.

I must raise only one mild quarrel with Wilson and Sober. I agree en­tirely that units of selection must be denned as interactors, but I prefer a “looser” or “broader” concept of interaction that fosters the proper identi­fication of highest-level individuals in species and clade selection. Wilson and Sober stress the “organism-like” properties of interactors, and therefore make the confusing and regrettable linguistic decision to use “individual” for conventional bodies, and “organism” as the general name for a unit of selec­tion at any hierarchical level; whereas I and most biologists (see Gould and Lloyd, 1999) advocate a reversed terminology. In characterizing the evolu­tionary principle of interaction, I would stress the potential for rich panoply of emergent fitnesses, and for the consequent capacity of plurifaction.

Their chosen stress on “organism-like” properties leads Wilson and Sober to emphasize direct modes of interaction based on actual contact of sympatric individuals — the old vision of two gladiators duking it out to the finish. But interaction does not require physical contact. Interaction occurs between individuals and environments, not necessarily between individual and in­dividual. The interaction must be able to yield plurifaction for causal rea­sons based on properties that enhance differential reproductive success — but, again, competing individuals need not interact directly with each other. Rather, to speak of selection, competing individuals only need to plurify at different relative rates based on similar causal interactions with environ­ments. But the environments may be spatially separate and broadly defined. This issue does not often arise at the traditional level of Darwin's chosen evo­lutionary individuals — that is, organisms. But higher-level individuals, partic­ularly species and clades, do often compete without contact — and our notion of units of selection must include this important mode of interaction.

Several thoughtful biologists have stressed this point, and I have compiled a small file of such statements. I shall present here only the forceful argument of Williams (1992, p. 25), who has changed his view substantially since for­mulating the theory of gene selectionism in 1966:

There are many further questions on the meaning and limits of clade selection. One issue is whether the populations that bear the gene pools need be in ecological competition with each other. I believe that this is not required, any more than individuals within a population need inter­act ecologically to be subject to individual selection. The reproductive success or failure of a soil arthropod, with an expected lifetime dispersal of a few meters, will hardly influence prospects for a conspecific a hun­dred meters away. But the descendants of these two individuals might compete, and genes passed on by one may ultimately prevail over those passed on by the other. Selective elimination of one and survival of the other a hundred meters away is individual selection as long as the two arthropods can be assigned to the same population and their genes to the same gene pool. ... In the same way, two gene pools in allopatry can be subject to natural selection if, as must always be true, their descendants might be alternatives for representation in the biota . . . The ultimate prize for which all clades are in competition is representation in the biota.





The internal incoherence of gene selectionism


I regard the heyday of gene selectionism as an unusual episode in the history of science — for I am convinced that the theory's central argument is logically incoherent, whatever the attraction (and partial validity) of several tenets, and despite the value of a mental exercise that tries to reconceptualize all na­ture from a gene's point of view. Close textual analysis* of this theory's lead­ing documents reveals persistent internal problems, explicitly recognized by authors and invariably met by arguments so flawed in construction that even the defenders seem embarrassed, or at least well aware of the glaring insuf­ficiency.

I am not alone in noting this peculiar situation, and in calling for some seri­ous consideration by historians. Wilson and Sober (1994, p. 590) write: “The situation is so extraordinary that historians of science should study it in de­tail: a giant edifice is built on the foundation of genes as replicators, and therefore as the 'fundamental' unit of selection, which seems to obliterate the concept of groups as organisms. In truth, however, the replicator concept cannot even account for the organismic properties of individuals. Almost as an afterthought, the vehicle concept is tacked onto the edifice to reflect the harmonious organization of individuals, but it is not extended to the level of groups.”

The central problem lies as deep as our definition of the key concept of “cause” in science. Aristotle proposed a broad concept of causality divided into four aspects, which he called material, efficient, formal and final (or, roughly, stuff, action, plan and purpose — that is, the bricks, the mason, the blueprint and the function, in the standard “parable of the house,” used for more than two millennia to explicate Aristotle's concept). As many historians have noted, modern science may virtually be defined by a revision of this broad view, and a restriction of “cause,” as a concept and definition, to the aspect that Aristotle called “efficient.” (The word “efficient” derives from the Latin facere, to make or to do. Efficient causes are actual movers and shakers, the agents that apply the forces. Aristotle's term does not engage the modern English meaning of doing something well, as opposed to doing something at all.)

The Cartesian or Newtonian worldview, the basis of modern science, banned final cause for physical objects (while retaining the concept of pur­pose for biological adaptation, so long as mechanical causes, rather than con­scious external agencies, could be identified — a problem solved by natural se­lection in the 19th century). As for Aristotle's material and formal causes, these notions retained their relevance, but lost their status as “causes” under a mechanical worldview that restricted causal status to active agents. The material and formal causes of a house continue to matter: brick or sticks fash­ion different kinds of buildings, while the bricks just remain in a pile, absent a plan for construction. But we no longer refer to these aspects of building as “causes.” Material and formal attributes have become background condi­tions or operational constraints in the logic and terminology of modern sci­ence.

I present this apparent digression because the chief error of gene selectionism lies in a failed attempt to depict genes as efficient causes in ordinary natural selection — and the chief “textual mark” of failure can be located in tortuous and clearly discomforting (even to the authors!) arguments ad­vanced by all leading gene selectionists in a valiant struggle to “get through” this impediment. For no matter how an author might choose to honor genes as basic units, as carriers of heredity to the next generation, as faithful repli­cators, or whatever, one cannot deny a fundamental fact of nature: in or­dinary, garden-variety natural selection — Darwin's observational basis and legacy — organisms, and not genes, operate as the “things out there” that live and die, reproduce or fail to propagate, in the interaction with environ­ments that we call “natural selection.” Organisms act as Aristotle's efficient causes — the actors and doers — in the standard form of Darwin's great and universal game.

Gene selectionists know this, of course — so they must then struggle to construct an argument for saying that, even though organisms do the explicit work, genes may somehow still be construed as primary “units of selection,” or causal agents in the Darwinian process. This misguided search arises from a legitimate intuition — that genes are vitally important in evolution, and clearly central to the process of natural selection — followed by the false infer­ence that genes should therefore be designated as primary causes. Needless to say, no biologist wishes to deny the centrality or importance of genes, just as this intuition holds. But genes simply cannot operate as efficient causes in Darwin's process of organismic selection. Genes, as carriers of continuity to the next generation, may be designated as material causes in Aristotle's aban­doned terminology. But we no longer refer to the material aspects of natural processes as “causes.” Organisms “struggle” as agents or efficient causes; their “reward” may be measured by greater representation of their genes, or material legacies, in future generations. Genes represent the product, not the agent — the stuff of continuity, not the cause of throughput.

The standard gambit of gene selectionists, in the light of this recognized problem, invokes two arguments, both indefensible.

Attempts to assign agency to genes by denying emergent properties to organisms. Once one admits, as all gene selectionists must and do, that genes propagate via selection on organisms as interactors, how then can one possibly ascribe direct causal agency to genes rather than to bodies? Only one logical exit from this conundrum exists: the assertion that each gene stands as an optimal product in its own place, and that bodies im­pose no consequences upon individual genes beyond providing a home for joint action. If such a view could be defended, then bodies would become pas­sive aggregates of genes — mere packaging — and selection on a body could then be read as a convenient shorthand summary for selection on all resident genes, considered individually.

But such a reductionistic view can only apply if genes build bodies with­out nonlinear or nonadditive interactions in developmental architecture. Any nonlinearity precludes the causal decomposition of a body into genes con­sidered individually — for bodies then become, in the old adage, “more than the sum of their parts.” In technical parlance, nonlinearity leads to “emer­gent” properties and fitness at the organismic level — and when selection works upon such emergent features, then causal reduction to individual genes and their independent summations becomes logically impossible. I trust that the empirical resolution of this issue will not strike anyone as controver­sial, for we all understand that organisms are stuffed full of emergent fea­tures — an old intuition stunningly affirmed by the first fruits of mapping the human genome (see the full issues of Science and Nature in February 2001 and my own initial reaction for general audiences in Gould, 2001). What else is developmental biology but the attempt to elucidate such nonlinearities? The error of gene selectionists does not lie in their stubborn assertion of pure additivity in the face of such knowledge, but rather in their concep­tual failure to recognize that this noncontroversial nonlinearity destroys their theory.

Dawkins admits the apparent problem (1976, p. 40): “But now we seem to have a paradox. If building a baby is such an intricate venture, and if every gene needs several thousands of fellow genes to complete its task, how can we reconcile this with my picture of indivisible genes, springing like immortal chamois from body to body down the ages: the free, untrammeled, and self-seeking agents of life?”

Dawkins attempts a lame resolution by invoking the quintessentially Oxbridge metaphor of rowing, with the nine men (eight oarsmen and a cox) as genes, and the boat as a body. Of innumerable candidate rowers, we put to­gether the best boat “by random shuffling of the candidates for each posi­tion” — and then running large numbers of trials until the finest combination emerges. Of course the rowers must cooperate in a joint task, but we generate no nonlinearities because localized optimality prevails, and the winning boat ends up with the best possible oarsman in each place. Dawkins then transfers this image back to biology and asserts his view of selection as piecemeal opti­mization — so that each locus (each seat in the boat) eventually houses the best candidate: “Many a good gene gets into bad company, and finds itself sharing a body with a lethal gene, which kills the body off in childhood. Then the good gene is destroyed along with the rest. But this is only one body, and replicas of the same good gene live on in other bodies which lack the lethal gene . . . Many [good genes] perish through other forms of ill luck, say when their body is struck by lightning. But by definition luck, good and bad, strikes at random, and a gene which is consistently on the losing side is not unlucky; it is a bad gene” (1976, p. 41).

Such a notion of individualized genetic optimality must be rejected as empirically false; but even if true, this concept still wouldn't support the re­quired claim for nonexistence of emergent organismic features. Even Daw­kins admits (in the quotation just above) that selection can only optimize “phenotypic consequences” (1982, p. 237) — and if phenotypes arise (as they do) by complex nonadditivity among genetic effects, then the genes in your body cannot maintain the essential property of independence represented by Dawkins's metaphor of optimal goats, hopping happily and separately across the generations.

In any case, this false view of organisms as additive consequences of individually optimized genes underlies the familiar metaphorical language developed by Dawkins over the years: “I am treating a mother as a machine programmed to do everything in its power to propagate copies of the genes which reside inside it” (1976, p. 132). Or “A monkey is a machine which pre­serves genes up trees; a fish is a machine which preserves genes in the water; there is even a small worm which preserves genes in German beer mats. DNA works in mysterious ways” (1976, p. 22). These colorful images misstate ac­tual pathways of causality. Organisms work in wondrous ways, and they op­erate via emergent properties that invalidate Dawkins's concept of genes as primary agents.

The ceteris paribus dodge. When the logic of an argument re­quires that the empirical world operate in a certain manner, and nature then refuses to cooperate, unwavering supporters often try to maintain their advo­cacy by employing the tactic of conjectural “as if.” That is, you admit the failure of complex nature to meet your theoretical needs, but then claim that you will simplify the actual circumstances “as if” the system under study operated in the required way. The classical “as if” argument goes by its Latin title of ceteris paribus, or “all other things being equal.” Ceteris paribus imposes additivity upon a system truly made of complexly interacting parts. You iso­late one factor and state that you will analyze its independent effects by hold­ing all other factors constant.

Ceteris paribus ranks among the oldest of scholarly devices, an indispens­able tactic for any student of complex systems. I am certainly not trying to mount a general assault upon this venerable and valuable mode of exempli­fication. Two common circumstances define the legitimate domain of ceteris paribus: (1) as a heuristic or exploratory device for approaching systems of such complexity that you don't even know how to think about influences of particular parts, unless you can hypothetically assign all others to a theoreti­cal background of constancy; and (2) as a powerful experimental tool when you can actually hold other factors constant and perturb the system by vary­ing your studied factor alone.

But ceteris paribus becomes an illegitimate dodge, an invalid prop to make a potentially false argument unbeatable by definition, in systems dominated by nonadditivity — that is, where the very act of holding all other factors con­stant may make your favored factor work in a manner contrary to its actual operation in a real world of interaction. If A conquers B only when the two entities share a field alone, but usually loses to B when C also dwells on the field, and if real fields invariably include C, then we cannot crown A as abso­lutely superior to B on the basis of a single and artificial ceteris paribus trial that excluded C from action and consideration.

The use of ceteris paribus to support gene selectionism constitutes a simi­lar denial of a known reality. This tactic represents a fallback position after acknowledging the impossibility of asserting a genuine claim for nonaddi­tivity in the translation of genes to organisms. In other words, you admit that massive nonlinearity actually exists, but then state that, for purposes of dis­cussion, you will counterfactually impose ceteris paribus so that genes can be equated with linear effects. For example, Dawkins explicitly invokes the key phrase (in English rather than Latin) in defending his requisite (but fal­lacious) notion that genes may be identified as operating “for” particular parts of phenotypes, thus creating the impression that organisms may be treated as additive aggregates rather than entities defined by nonlinear inter­action.

For purposes of argument it will be necessary to speculate about genes “for” doing all sorts of improbable things. If I speak, for example, of a hypothetical gene “for saving companions from drowning,” and you find such a concept incredible, . . . recall that we are not talking about the gene as the sole antecedent cause of all the complex muscular con­tractions, sensory integrations, and even conscious decisions, which are involved in saving somebody from drowning. We are saying nothing about the question of whether learning, experience, or environmental influences enter into the development of the behavior. All you have to concede is that it is possible for a single gene, other things being equal and lots of other essential genes and environmental factors being present, to make a body more likely to save somebody from drowning than its allele would (1976, p. 66).



In another passage (1976, p. 39), Dawkins unwittingly surrenders this neces­sary tactic by admitting that we dare not discuss the interactive web of em­bryonic development, lest we be unable to speak of genes “for” particular as­pects of organismal phenotypes:

Everybody knows that wheat plants grow bigger in the presence of ni­trate than in its absence. But nobody would be so foolish as to claim that, on its own, nitrate can make a wheat plant. Seed, soil, sun, water, and various minerals are obviously all necessary as well. But if all these other factors are held constant, and even if they are allowed to vary within limits, addition of nitrate will make the wheat plants grow bigger. So it is with single genes in the development of an embryo. An interlocking web of relationships controls embryonic development so complex that we had best not contemplate it.



As a striking demonstration that ceteris paribus cannot rescue gene selectionism from logical paradoxes and violations of ordinary linguistic usage, Dawkins (1982, p. 164) addresses the problem of how to treat a genetic dele­tion favored by natural selection at the organismic level, if genes represent the fundamental units of selection, and if we must be able to treat each genetic item as a Darwinian individual with a distinct and independent history. If “gene language” must prevail, and if we need to specify the selective value of such a deletion, what can we call the loss but “a replicating absence”! Should we not, at this point, admit instead that organisms are the relevant causal agents in this case, and that organisms have achieved a selective benefit by the alternate but orthodox genetic route of deletion rather than substitution? Some humans have done well with “plenty of nothing,” but I don't think we should root our ontology in taxonomies for various kinds and forms of faith­fully propagating absences.

Any organism that happened to experience a random deletion of part of its selfish DNA would, by definition, be a mutant organism. The deletion itself would be a mutation, and it would be favored by natural selection to the extent that organisms possessing it benefited from it, presumably because they did not suffer the economic wastage of space, materials, and time that selfish DNA brings. Mutant organisms would, other things being equal [ceteris paribus again!], reproduce at a higher rate than the loaded down “wild type” individuals, and the deletion would conse­quently become more common in the gene pool. Here we are recognizing that the deletion itself, the absence of the selfish DNA, is itself a replicat­ing entity (a replicating absence!), which can be favored by selection.



All major proponents of gene selectionism have unintentionally illustrated the theory's incoherence by trying to “cash out” their system, and failing at the crucial point of assigning causal agency in natural selection. For, however these proponents may talk about genes as primary agents or units of selec­tion, they cannot deny that nature's Darwinian action generally unfolds be­tween discrete organisms and their environments. These authors therefore ac­knowledge this basic fact and then tend to lapse into verbal obfuscation on the gene's behalf. I have already noted a prime example in Williams's claim, quoted previously in another context, that organismic selection should be re­garded not “as a level of selection in addition to that of the gene, but as the primary mechanism of selection at the genic level.” But what does this state­ment mean? Williams recognizes organismic selection as the “primary mecha­nism” by which genes pass differentially from one generation to the next. But primary mechanisms are efficient causes in any standard analysis of the logic of science. Williams (1992, p. 38) presents an accurate epitome of selection in the following passage: he states that selection must always operate on interactors (and he knows, as the previous quotation shows, that organisms usually constitute the relevant interactors in cases that he wishes to describe as genic selection); he also recognizes that information must pass to future generations by faithful heredity, and he seems to acknowledge that such bi­ased passage defines the result, not the cause, of selection. Yet he fails to take the final step of acknowledging that these statements debar gene selectionism as the mechanism of evolution. “Natural selection must always act on physi­cal entities (interactors) that vary in aptitude for reproduction, either because they differ in the machinery of reproduction or in that of survival and re­source capture on which reproduction depends. It is also necessary that there be what Darwin called 'the strong principle of inheritance,' so that events in the material domain can influence the codical record. Offspring must tend to resemble their own parents more than those of other offspring. Whenever these conditions are found there will be natural selection.”

Over the years, Dawkins has developed a litany of similar admissions. Of course organisms must be regarded as the foci of selection, but since biased gene passage occurs as a result of this process, we may identify genes as agents of selection. (But results are not causes, although foci of action surely are): “Just as whole boats win or lose races, it is indeed individuals [organ­isms] who live or die, and the immediate manifestation of natural selection is nearly always the individual level. But the long-term consequences of non-random individual death and reproductive success are manifested in the form of changing gene frequencies in the gene pool” (1976, p. 48).

Dawkins then apologizes for framing his descriptions in terms of organ­isms as causal actors, excusing himself for succumbing to temptations of con­venience. (But perhaps we find this mode “convenient” because we achieve the best description of a causal reality thereby — while the genic mode remains tortuous and uncomfortable because we sense the central error in such for­mulation): “In practice it is usually convenient, as an approximation, to re­gard the individual body as an agent 'trying' to increase the number of all its genes in future generations. I shall use the language of convenience. Unless otherwise stated, 'altruistic behavior' and 'selfish behavior' will mean behav­ior directed by one animal body towards another [p. 50] . . . We shall con­tinue to treat the individual as a selfish machine, programmed to do whatever is best for his genes as a whole. This is the language of convenience [p. 71].”

In a later book (1982, p. 4) Dawkins admits that proxy — that is, must select gene replicators via organisms as causal actors: “The most impor­tant kind of replicator is the 'gene' or small genetic fragment. Replicators are not, of course, selected directly, but by proxy; they are judged by their phenotypic effects.”

This argument, I think, has truly become an inadaptive meme, destined for eventual extinction, but propagated wherever gene selectionism survives, whether in technical literature or popular presentation. A major popular book on this topic holds (Cronin, 1991, p. 289): “If organisms are not repli­cators, what are they? The answer is that they are vehicles of replicators... Groups, too, are vehicles, but far less distinct, less unified ... In this weak sense, then, 'group selection' could occur... [but it] would in no way under­mine the status of genes as the only units of replicator selection. This does not mean that higher-level entities are unimportant in evolution. They are impor­tant, but in a different way: as vehicles.”





Bookkeeping and causality: the fundamental error of

gene selectionism


The error and the incoherence of gene selectionism, as documented above, can be summarized in a single statement illustrating the fruitful, “Pareto-like” character of the central fallacy: proponents of gene selectionism have confused bookkeeping with causality. This error achieves its Pareto status of substantial utility because changes recorded at the genetic level do play a fundamental part in characterizing evolution, and records of these changes (bookkeeping) do maintain an important role in evolutionary theory. But the error remains: bookkeeping* is not causality; natural selection is a causal process, and units or agents of selection must be defined as overt actors in the mechanism, not merely as preferred items for tabulating results.

No one has ever stated the issue more accurately or succinctly than George Williams himself (1992, p. 13), thus increasing my puzzlement at his failure to recognize how his own formulation invalidates the gene selectionism that still wins his lip service: “For natural selection to occur and be a factor in evo­lution, replicators must manifest themselves in interactors, the concrete reali­ties that confront a biologist. The truth and usefulness of a biological theory must be evaluated on the basis of its success in explaining and predicting ma­terial phenomena. It is equally true that replicators (codices) are a concept of great interest and usefulness and must be considered with great care for any formal theory of evolution, either cultural or biological.” Williams's state­ment agrees completely with the position that I have advanced in this book — an attitude that, by general consensus, leads logically and directly to the hierarchical model of selection, and the invalidity of single-level, gene-based views. Williams allows that interactors represent the “concrete realities” con­fronting biologists (and chapter 4 of his 1992 book eloquently defends the concept of legitimate interactors at several hierarchical levels of increasing ge­nealogical inclusion). He admits that both the “truth and usefulness” of a bi­ological theory, natural selection in this case, depends upon the explanation of material phenomena — that is, interactors operating as agents. He does not include replicators — the basis of gene selectionism — in this category, for his last sentence grants them a separate but equal status in evolutionary theory: “It is equally true that replicators (codices) are a concept of great interest” needed “for any formal theory of evolution.” Now, if replicators are not causal agents, but are vital for any full account of evolution — then what are they? I suggest that we view gene-level replicators as basic units for keeping the books of evolutionary change — as “atoms” in the tables of recorded results.

Williams did not slip or misspeak in the quotation cited above. He repeats this separation of a causal agent from a basis of hereditary transmission — with interactors as agents and replicators as transmitters — in several other passages, including (1992, p. 38) “Natural selection must always act on phys­ical entities (interactors) ... It is also necessary that there be what Darwin called 'the strong principle of inheritance'...”

Whereas Williams makes valid separations and defines proper roles, but then seems unwilling to own the theoretical consequences, Dawkins, on the other hand, seems merely confused. In discussing group selection (1982, p. 115), for example, Dawkins writes: “The end result of the selection dis­cussed is a change in gene frequencies, for example, an increase of 'altruistic genes' at the expense of 'selfish genes.' It is still the genes that are regarded as the replicators which actually survive (or fail to survive) as a consequence of the (vehicle) selection process.”

By putting the word “vehicle” in parentheses, as a reminder of selection's intrinsic nature rather than a mere modifying adjective, Dawkins admits that interactors (vehicles in his terminology), not replicators, operate as agents of selection. He describes the differential survival of replicators as a consequen­tial result of this causal process — therefore as units for bookkeeping rather than agents of causality — but he then fails to disentangle these two different aspects of evolution, while continuing to grant favored status to genes.

We may indeed, and legitimately as a practical measure, decide to keep track of an organism's success in selection by counting the relative representa­tion of its genes in future generations. (In large part, we count at the genic level for the reason always emphasized by Williams and Dawkins — because sexual organisms do not replicate faithfully and therefore cannot be traced as discrete entities across generations.) But this practical decision for counting does not deprive the organism of status as a causal agent, nor does such a procedure grant causality to the objects counted. The listing of accounts is bookkeeping — a vitally important subject in evolutionary biology, but not a form of causality.

If, as I have argued (see also Wilson and Sober, 1994), the incoherence of gene selectionism denotes a rare case in science of an influential theory felled by a logical error — in this case the confusion of bookkeeping with causality — rather than a fallacious proposal about the empirical world, then we must ask why so many people fell into this error so readily, and why the fallacy did not become more quickly apparent. I suspect that three major reasons underlie not only the error of gene selectionism, but also the strong willingness, even the fervor, expressed by so many evolutionists in embracing the concept. The first two reasons may claim a social basis in traditions of scientific inquiry. But the third reason, and surely the most intriguing from both a scientific and philosophical perspective, emanates directly from the logical structure of hi­erarchies, the conceptual framework that must replace gene selectionism.

The two reasons rooted in traditions of scientific procedure include the most general of statements and a preference peculiar to traditions of Anglo-phonic evolutionary biology. For the generality, I state nothing profound or original in pointing out that a decision to privilege the level of genes plays into the strongest of all preferences in Western science: our traditions of reductionism, or the desire to explain larger-scale phenomena by properties of the smallest constituent particles.

The allure of reductionism encourages the following kind of error, or sloppy thinking: we correctly note that genes play a fundamental role in evo­lution (as preferred items for a calculus of change — the bookkeeping func­tion); we also recognize that genes lie at the base of a causal cascade in the de­velopment of organisms; finally, and most generally, we view genes as the closest biological approach to an “atom” of basic structure, and therefore as the cardinal entity of a reductionistic research program. From these state­ments, we easily slip into the unwarranted inference that genes must also be fundamental units or agents in natural selection, the primary causal theory of our profession — all the while forgetting the criteria of individuality and inter­action that define units or agents within the logic of the theory itself.

The second, and more particular, reason flows from explicit traditions of the Modern Synthesis, especially from the approach favored by Fisherian population genetics (see Chapter 7). The heuristics of this field prospered greatly with models that kept track of gene frequencies without worrying much about the locus of selective action. A common fallacy in science then conflates a practical basis for success with the causal structure of nature. Jim Crow (1994, p. 616), one of the world's most thoughtful geneticists, ex­pressed this point particularly well, but then also failed to distinguish book­keeping from causality. Writing “In praise of replicators” — and well should we praise them, but, I would argue, as excellent agents for accounting! — Crow explained why our traditions have favored the genetic level of analysis (1994, p. 616):

The reason, I think, is that these pioneers [Fisher and other founders of the Synthesis] and their intellectual heirs have been concerned, not with selection as an end in itself, but with selection as a way of changing gene frequencies. Selection acts in many ways: it can be stabilizing; it can be diversifying; it can be directional; it can be between organelles; it can be between individuals; it can be between groups ... But the bottom line has always been how much selection changes allele frequencies and through these, how much it changes phenotypes. This suggests that we should judge the effectiveness of selection at different levels by its effects on gene frequencies.



I could not ask for a better statement of (unconscious) support for the posi­tion here maintained. Again, as I noted in several other quotations from gene selectionists, Crow allows that selection, as a causal force (“selection as an end in itself,” in his words), operates on interactors at several hierarchical levels of individuality, including groups. He also admits that changes in gene frequencies arise as a result of such selection. He then states — and again I don't object — that these alterations in allelic frequencies should be read as a “bottom line” in judgments about selection's effect. Nicely said, but a bottom line for what? Crow then gives his crucial answer — for keeping the books of evolutionary change: “we should judge the effectiveness of selection at differ­ent levels by its effects on gene frequencies.” Altered gene frequencies are therefore results (for bookkeeping), while selection (the cause of the changes) operates upon interactors “at different levels” of individuality.

This notion of a “bottom line” also provides our best entree into the third and most important reason for choosing genes as units of bookkeeping: the intrinsically asymmetrical nature of causal flow in hierarchies of inclusion. I particularly appreciate the doubly amplified utility of hierarchy theory in this example — for the hierarchical view, as I shall show, both serves as a replace­ment for gene selectionism, but also (in a situation not devoid of irony)* pro­vides the rationale for why many biologists chose, albeit for fallacious rea­sons, to focus on genes in the first place!

We do need to keep the books of evolutionary change, and bookkeeping does require a basic unit of accounting. Candidates for this status must obey the primary criterion always stressed by gene selectionists: faithful replica­tion. But genes do not exhaust the range of faithful replicators. Asexual or­ganisms and species also rank as sufficiently faithful. Reductionistic prefer­ences in general, and claims for relatively greater faithfulness of genic vs. higher-level replication, might set a preference for genes — but another crucial argument, usually unrecognized or unmentioned, seals the case.

Because bookkeeping is not the same enterprise as causality, and because we are not, in simply counting, trying to establish the causes of differential success, we want to make sure, above all, that we choose a unit better suited than any other to record all evolutionary changes, whatever their causal ba­sis. No single unit of bookkeeping can monitor every conceivable change, but the gene becomes our unit of choice because the nature of hierarchies dictates that genes inevitably provide the most comprehensive record of changes at all levels. (Even so, gene records will miss certain kinds of changes that we gener­ally call evolutionary. For example, as Wilson and Sober (1994) point out, assortative mating of organisms within a population may greatly increase the ratio of homozygotes to heterozygotes at many loci, but need not change gene frequencies in the population.)

Hierarchies are allometric, not fractal (see Gould and Lloyd, 1999), and various levels translate a common set of causes to strikingly different results and frequencies. Moreover, hierarchies are directional, and therefore not in­different to the nature of the flow of influence. As the most important of all such asymmetries, change at a low level may or may not produce an effect at higher levels — “upward causation” in the standard terminology (see Camp­bell, 1974; Vrba, 1989). But change at a higher level must always sort the in­cluded units of all lower levels — by the analogous process of “downward causation.”

If a gene increases in copy number within a genome by duplication and lat­eral spread (gene selection in the genuine sense), phenotypes of organisms may or may not be affected. But selection on higher-level individuals always sorts the lower-level individuals included within. If ugly organisms out compete beautiful conspecifics, then genes for ugliness increase in the population. If stenotypic species prevail over eurytopes in species selection, then genes as­sociated with stenotypy increase within the lineage. If species of polychaetes eliminate species of priapulids in competition over geological time, then polychaete genes increase in the marine biota.

Given this intrinsic asymmetry, what single unit would a good bookkeeper choose? Obviously not the organism, or any high-level individual, because we would then miss many changes at lower levels — and a good bookkeeper wants, as the chief desideratum of his profession, to record all changes. As noted above, low-level selection need not impose any effect upon higher lev­els at all. Equally obviously, our optimal bookkeeper will choose genes — not because genes are intrinsically more basic (the reductionist fallacy); not because genes are primary causal agents, or causal agents at all (the gene selectionist fallacy); and not because genes replicate faithfully (for other kinds of individuals do so as well); but, rather, because genes, as the lowest-level individuals in a hierarchy, manifest the unique property of recording all changes. Thus, the intrinsic nature of hierarchies sets our preference for genes as units of bookkeeping — for only genes act as nearly ubiquitous re­corders of all evolutionary alterations, whatever their level or cause of occur­rence.

Finally, we must note one other property that, while strongly favoring genes as units of bookkeeping, shows even more clearly why genes cannot be exclusive units of selection, or causal agents. Bookkeepers must, above all, be objectivists, not sleuths or storytellers. A good bookkeeper wants an unimpeachable record, not a causal hypothesis (that can always be wrong). Books kept in terms of gene frequencies become the best objective records of “de­scent with modification” because they do not make causal attributions, but only count changes (“just the facts, ma'am,” to cite a famous detective from the early days of television). The hierarchical nature of evolutionary mechan­ics, and the simultaneous action of selection on individuals at several levels, implies our inability to know the causal basis of change from records of al­tered gene frequencies alone.

Genetic change cannot, of itself, specify the causal level of sorting because selection at any higher level sorts individuals at all included lower levels as an automatic effect, and not necessarily for direct causal reasons at all. Two ba­sic considerations bar inferences of cause from the genetic account books alone. First, an observation of genetic sorting doesn't specify the relevant causal level. A gene associated with strong jaws may increase in frequency within the class Polychaeta because polychaete organisms with strong jaws out compete weaker-jawed conspecifics in organismic selection; because poly­chaete species with strong jaws also develop emergent populational charac­ters that defeat weak-jawed species in species selection; or because strong-jawed polychaetes do especially well in driving out jawless priapulids by clade selection.

Second, even when we can identify the level of causality for an incident of genetic sorting, we cannot know (from the increase in frequency alone) whether the gene sorted positively has prevailed by a selected effect upon the phenotype, or for a set of possibly nonadaptive reasons. Does the gene associ­ated with strong jaws actually promote the construction of this phenotypic basis for organismic selection, or has this gene hitchhiked to greater fre­quency by close linkage with another gene that does build the selected pheno­type? Nonadaptive possibilities only increase for selection at higher levels. If polychaetes have increased by clade selection over priapulids, does the plurified polychaete gene big-A build part of the relevant priapulid-beating phenotype, or does big-A just count as one of the myriad polychaete genes that happen to specify, by homology and a few hundred million years of evo­lutionary separation, the historical uniqueness of the clade?

The nature of hierarchies dictates a choice of genes as optimal units of bookkeeping. The nature of hierarchies also creates a possibility — then real­ized in nature for fascinating reasons largely unknown, and mostly beyond the scope of this book (but see Buss, 1987) — for structuring the world of biol­ogy as a hierarchy of individuals, each encompassing the ones below as new levels accrete in evolution, and each capable of acting as a unit of selection, a causal agent of Darwin's expanded theory.





Gambits of reform and retreat by gene selectionists


As I have emphasized throughout this section, gene selectionism can't be made to work as a general philosophy. The logic of the theory does not co­here, and the system cannot attain consistent completion. Yet the allure of the gene remains powerful, largely for reasons of general preference in our cul­ture, rather than for any observed power or intrinsic biological status pos­sessed by evolutionary individuals of this lowest level. When an incoherent argument remains intriguing, and supporters cannot bear the wrench of total abandonment, a favored theory must be festooned with compromises and “howevers,” or so changed in form that only lip service remains to cover a truly altered substance. Often, given human tendencies to paint a bright face on adversity, gene selectionists have made their necessary retreats, but pre­sented them as refinements or elaborations of the original theory. In this clos­ing section, I shall show that the two most prominent “revisions” of gene selectionism — Dawkins's extended phenotype (1982) and Williams's codical selection (1992) — represent defeats rather than improvements as advertised.





DAWKINS ON THE “EXTENDED PHENOTYPE.” I always admired the chutzpah of Senator Aikens' brilliant solution to the morass of our involve­ment in the Vietnamese War. At the height of our reverses and misfortunes, he advised that we should simply declare victory and get out. Richard Dawkins got in with his 1976 book, The Selfish Gene. He declared victory with The Extended Phenotype in 1982 — although he had really, at least with respect to the needs and logic of his original argument, gotten out.

With admirable clarity, and no ambivalence, Dawkins proclaimed the doc­trine of exclusive gene selectionism in 1976: “I must argue for my belief that the best way to look at evolution is in terms of selection occurring at the low­est level of all ... I shall argue that the fundamental unit of selection, and therefore of self-interest, is not the species, nor the group, nor even, strictly, the individual. It is the gene, the unit of heredity (1976, p. 12). So selection occurs at only one lowest level — the gene, labelled as 'the fundamental unit of selection.' Nothing more inclusive, not even an organism, can be called a unit of selection.”

Dawkins presented his later work, The Extended Phenotype, as an ex­tension and elaboration of gene selectionism: “This book,” he wrote, “is in some ways the sequel to my previous book, The Selfish Gene” (1982, p. v). Dawkins had admitted, in 1976, that genes work through phenotypes of the “lumbering robots” (organisms) serving as their passive homes. But if genes are nature's real actors, and phenotypes only their means of expression, then why limit phenotypes to bodies? Any consequence of a gene should be equally capable of carrying the gene's interest in a process of selection. Dawkins admitted of course that most aspects of this extended phenotype — the footprint of a shorebird in the sand, for example — will be too ephemeral, or too by the by, to be effective in the gene's interest. But other parts of the extended phenotype (with the beaver's dam as Dawkins's favorite example) do contribute to the success of beaver genes, and should be included within “the extended phenotype” that the gene — the ultimate and only unit of selec­tion (at least in 1976) — can manipulate in its full range of machinations for replicative success.

Dawkins (1982, pp. iv-vii) therefore insisted that the viewpoint of The Extended Phenotype evolved gradually and progressively from The Selfish Gene. “The present book,” he tells us, “goes further,” presumably in the same direction:

This belief — that if adaptations are to be treated as “for the good of” something, that something is the gene — was the fundamental assump­tion of my previous book. The present book goes further. To dramatize it a bit, it attempts to free the selfish gene from the individual organism, which has been its conceptional prison. The phenotypic effects of a gene are the tools by which it levers itself into the next generation, and these tools may “extend” far outside the body in which the gene sits, even reaching deep into the nervous system of other organisms. Since it is not a factual position I am advocating, but a way of seeing facts, I wanted to warn the reader not to expect “evidence” in the normal sense of the word.



So genes have become even more fundamental, and bodies even more inconsequential: “Fundamentally, what it going on is that replicating molecules ensure their survival by means of phenotypic effects on the world. It is only incidentally true that these phenotypic effects happen to be packaged up into units called individual organisms” (Dawkins, 1982, pp. 4-5).*

But now the argument begins to unravel. Just when the gene seems poised to swallow the organism entirely as just one incidental aspect of the gene's armamentarium (the fully extended phenotype), Dawkins turns around, and tells us that we may treat organisms as focal entitites after all, and describe evolution from the organism's point of view just as well: “I am not saying that the selfish organism view is necessarily wrong, but my argument, in its strong form, is that it is looking at the matter the wrong way up ... I am pretty con­fident that to look at life in terms of genetic replicators preserving themselves by means of their extended phenotypes is at least as satisfactory as to look at it in terms of selfish organisms maximizing their inclusive fitness” (1982, pp. 6-7).

Shall we then favor the gene or the organism? Dawkins claims to prefer genes and to find greater insight in this formulation. But he allows that you or I might prefer organisms — and it really doesn't matter. In a telling analogy, Dawkins compares genes and organism to the two possible versions (different cerebral resolutions of the same visual reality) in the famous optical illusion known as the Necker Cube:

After a few more seconds the mental image flips back and it continues to alternate as long as we look at the picture. The point is that neither of the two perceptions of the cube is the correct nor “true” one. They are equally correct. Similarly the vision of life that I advocate, and label with the name of the extended phenotype is not probably more correct than the orthodox view. It is a different view and I suspect that, at least in some respects, it provides a deeper understanding. But I doubt that there is any experiment that could be done to prove my claim (1982, p. 1).



Moreover, we really needn't quarrel over our choices because the issue can achieve no empirical resolution in any case. I'll push my preference (and hope to persuade you of its greater capacity for mind stretching, its superior liter­ary charm, or its greater tickling of the fancy); and you can then advocate your opposite, and equally valid, version. Dawkins begins his book: “This is a work of unabashed advocacy. I want to argue in favor of a particular way of looking at animals and plants, and a particular way of wondering why they do the things that they do. What I am advocating is not a new theory, not a hypothesis which can be verified or falsified, not a model which can be judged by its predictions... I am not trying to convince anyone of the truth of any factual proposition” (1982, p. 1). This argument about equally valid, but quite inverse, perspectives on a common reality pervades the entire book, as in this late passage (1982, p. 232): “The whole story could have been told in ... the language of individual manipulation. The language of extended genet­ics is not demonstrably more correct. It is a different way of saying the same thing. The Necker Cube has flipped. Readers must decide for themselves whether they like the new view better than the old.”

Among professional philosophers, such Necker-Cube thinking goes by the name of conventionalism, an argument that frameworks of explanation can­not be judged as true or false, or even more or less empirically adequate — but only as equally correct, and only as more or less preferable by such nonfactual criteria as depth of insight provided or satisfaction gained in understand­ing. Conventionalism may offer an interesting and fruitful approach, espe­cially for some scientific debates that seem especially refractory to empirical resolution — and also (more generally) for teaching people that ideas and atti­tudes influence science; and that “naive realism,” with its assumption that improved theories arise only from observation, represents a silly and bank­rupt approach to the natural world.

But conventionalism cannot apply to this case because an empirical resolu­tion exists, and the apparent Necker-cube duality of gene or organism does not denote, as Dawkins mistakenly argues, two equally valid perspectives on the same issue, but rather expresses a correct vs. a false view of the nature of causality in Darwinian theory. Dawkins has misconstrued his categories in judging gene-based and organism-based viewpoints as alternative versions of the same kind of explanation. The gene-based view works best for bookkeep­ing, while the organism-based view represents one legitimate level of causal­ity — the one regarded as effectively ubiquitous and exclusive by Darwin him­self. In this sense, both views are valid; but they are not comparable — and genes vs. organisms do not represent alternatives on an identical playing field of common explanatory intent.

Moreover, Dawkins's shift from the selfish gene to the extended phenotype does not reflect a simple extension or elaboration of a consistent and develop­ing viewpoint. He tries to save face with such a portrayal, but his strategy fails. The conventionalism of The Extended Phenotype negates and denies the explicit defense of gene selectionism as an empirical reality, as presented in The Selfish Gene. Dawkins's first book says, in no uncertain terms (see quotation on page 618), those genes are exclusive units of selection (or causal agents), and that bodies, as passive lumbering robots, cannot play such a role. The second book says that we can view evolution equally well from either the gene's or the organism's point of view, that Dawkins still prefers genes, but that others remain free to favor bodies with just as much claim to empirical adequacy. The disparate logic of these two formulations precludes their inter­pretation as developing versions of the same view of life, and one theory is not a subtler extension of the other. These two positions connote logically contrasting, and mutually exclusive, accounts of causality in evolution. I do not happen to regard either as correct, but I think we can all agree that Dawkins's later view of the extended phenotype derails and controverts his earlier defense of gene selectionism as nature's true way.

I do not know why Dawkins altered his view so radically. But may I suggest that he simply could not — because no one can after a proper analysis of the basic logic of the case — maintain full allegiance to the fallacious argument of strict gene selectionism. Dawkins tried hard in 1976, but ultimately needed to make so many statements from the organism's point of view that he must have begun to wonder whether he could really continue to regard such organismal language as a mere convenience, while touting the genic formula­tion as a unique reality. Perhaps he finally decided that if organism-based lan­guage seemed so stubbornly ineluctable, then organism-based causality might be equally inevitable, at least as a legitimate option. With such an admission, the selfish gene becomes an impotent meme.





WILLIAMS'S CODICAL HIERARCHY. Williams's epochal book of 1966 set the intellectual basis for gene selectionism, and may justly be called the founding document for this ultimate version of Darwinian reductionism. But by 1992, Williams had realized that interactors, and not replicators, consti­tute units of selection, or causal agents in the usual sense of the term — and that hierarchy must hold because no level of interaction can be deemed exclu­sive, or even primary. Williams, however, did not wish to abandon his old ap­paratus for viewing genes as fundamental and preferred units of selection. But que faire? Genes are replicators in their only universal role (they can also be interactors in the much more restricted status of one legitimate level in an extensive hierarchy, as discussed on pp. 689–695) — and interactors, not repli­cators, are units of selection in the causal sense.

Williams therefore tried an interesting gambit. He admitted that interactors form a hierarchy of evolutionary individuals at several levels, and that these interactors are units of selection in our usual sense of material entities partici­pating in a causal process. These interactors build a material hierarchy — and gene selectionism cannot apply to this legitimate domain. Williams therefore established a different and parallel hierarchy* for abstract units of informa­tion (as opposed to material entities) — and he construed genes as basic “units of selection” in this alternative and parallel domain, which he called codical (the adjectival form of codices, the plural of codex, his term for a single unit of information). If genes can't claim exclusivity (or even causal status at all) as units of selection in the usual domain of material objects, then Williams would establish a new and separate hierarchy for nonmaterial units of infor­mation — and here the gene could continue to reign.

Williams therefore proposed a fundamental distinction between entities and information, speaking of “two mutually exclusive domains of selection, one that deals with material entities and another that deals with information and might be termed the codical domain” (1992, p. 10). But I do not think that the codical domain can claim either meaning or existence as a locus for causal units of selection, for two reasons:

Odd mapping upon legitimate intuitions. Williams continues his allegiance to the nemesis of gene selectionism, the false criterion that has always doomed the theory to incoherence: faithful replication as the defining property for a “unit of selection” — now reformatted as a unit that only exists in the newly formulated codical domain, for Williams has now admitted that replicators are not causal agents in the usual realm of material entities. Wil­liams promotes his old standard — faithful replication — as the primary crite­rion for “unithood” in his codical domain, thus leading to the following pe­culiar position: genes are units of selection (as the replicating consequence in the codical domain of selection upon organisms in the material domain); gene pools are also units of selection (as replicating consequences of higher-level selection upon groups to clades); but genotypes, in an intermediate category, are not units of selection (except in asexual organisms, where replication is faithful). Thus the codical domain skips a space in the hierarchy, and contains no organismic level of selection (except for asexual creatures) because the corresponding codex is impersistent.

The old error of confusing bookkeeping with causality. Williams's complex move in devising a separate hierarchy for nonmaterial units of information (and then juxtaposing this new sequence against the conventional hierarchy of evidently material and admittedly causal units), amounts to little beyond an elaborate and superfluous effort to rescue the un-salvageable theory of gene selectionism by granting both primacy and causal status (but only linguistically) to genes as replicators. But nothing new has been added beyond some terminology. The old error remains in full force — if anything even heightened by the counterintuitive complexities and mental manipulations required operationalizing the scheme of dual hierarchies. A parallel hierarchy for nonmaterial entities of information? What can such a claim mean? Take the idea apart; pull the codical clothing off this new em­peror, and whom do we find naked underneath? our old friend, the book­keeper. Why must he continually try to play on the field of material objects engaged in nature's grand game of causality? Why should he be ashamed of his vital but different role? Bookkeeping is also a necessary, and entirely hon­orable, activity. The results of causal processes must be tabulated, and we rightly treasure the lists. We continue to stand in awe before “60” in Babe Ruth's home run column for 1927, and “70” in Mark McGwire's for 1998. But 70 is a record, not a cause — a summary of a great achievement, not the bat itself, or the muscles in a pair of strong arms. As nonmaterial objects suited for recording, codices are units of bookkeeping.

The history of gene selectionism has provided a grand intellectual ad­venture for evolutionary theory — from inception as a manifesto (Williams, 1966), through numerous excursions into pop culture, to valiant (though doomed) attempts to work through the logical barriers and to develop a consistent and workable theory (Dawkins, 1982; Williams, 1992). “Pareto-errors” always inspire a good race. No one really loses — though false theories like gene selectionism must eventually yield — because the resulting clarifica­tions can only strengthen a field, and interestingly fallacious ideas often yield important insights. Without this debate, evolutionary biologists might never have properly clarified the differing roles of replicators and interactors, items for bookkeeping and units of selection. And we might not have developed a consistent theory of hierarchical selection without the stimulus of an opposite claim that genes could function as exclusive causal agents.

Some evolutionists, largely perhaps in fealty to their own pasts, continue to use the language of gene selectionism, even while their revised accounts eluci­date and unconsciously promote the hierarchical view (see, in particular, Williams's excellent fourth chapter, in his 1992 book, on selection upon multiple interactors at several levels). Williams, to use a locution of our times, may still be talking the talk of gene selectionism, but he is no longer walking the walk.

Nearly all-major participants in this discussion met at Ohio State Univer­sity in the summer of 1988. There I witnessed a wonderful little vignette that may serve as an epitome for this section. George Williams presented his new views (the substance of his 1992 book), and surprised many people with his conceptual move towards hierarchy (within his unaltered terminology). I could not imagine two more different personalities in the brief and telling interchange that followed. Marjorie Grene — the great student of Aristotle, grande dame of philosophy, one of the feistiest and toughest people I have ever known, and a supporter of the hierarchical view — looked at Williams and simply said: “You've changed a lot.” George Williams, one of the calmest and most laconic of men, replied: “It's been a long time.”





Logical and Empirical Foundations for the

Theory of Hierarchical Selection





LOGICAL VALIDATION AND EMPIRICAL CHALLENGES





R. A. Fisher and the compelling logic of species selection


R. A. Fisher added a short section entitled “the benefit of species” to the sec­ond edition (1958) of his founding document for the Modern Synthesis: The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection (first published in 1930). I do not know why he did so, but the result could not be more favorable for fruitful debate — for Fisher, in these few additional paragraphs, grants to the concept of species selection the two requisite properties for any healthy and controversial theory. In presenting his argument, Fisher proclaims the logic of spe­cies selection unassailable, and then denies that this genuine phenomenon could have any substantial importance in the empirical record of evolution on our planet. No situation can be more propitious for useful debate about a sci­entific theory than validation in logic accompanied by controversy about ac­tual evidence! (Obviously, I do not share Fisher's pessimism about empirical importance, and shall devote this section to explaining why.)

Fisher begins this interpolated passage by stating that Natural Selection (in his upper-case letters), in its conventional Darwinian mode of action among organisms, cannot explicitly build any features for “the benefit of the spe­cies” (though organismic adaptation may engender such effects as side con­sequences). Speaking of instinctual behaviors, Fisher writes (1958, p. 50): “Natural Selection can only explain these instincts in so far as they are indi­vidually beneficial, and leaves entirely open the question as to whether in the aggregate they are a benefit or an injury to the species.” But Fisher then rec­ognizes that, in principle, selection among species could occur, and could lead to higher-level adaptations directly beneficial to species. However, lest this logical imperative derail his strict Darwinian commitments to the primacy of organismic selection, Fisher then adds that species selection — though clearly valid in logic and therefore subject to realization in nature — must be far too weak (relative to organismic selection) to have any practical effect upon evo­lution. I regard the following lines (Fisher, 1958, p. 50) as one of the “great quotations” in the history of evolutionary thought:

There would, however, be some warrant on historical grounds for saying that the term Natural Selection should include not only the selective survival of individuals of the same species, but of mutually competing species of the same genus or family. The relative unimportance of this as an evolutionary factor would seem to follow decisively from the small num­ber of closely related species which in fact do come into competition, as compared to the number of individuals in the same species; and from the vastly greater duration of the species compared to the individual.



Fisher's theoretical validation of the logic behind species selection has never been effectively challenged. Even the most ardent gene selectionists have granted Fisher's point, and have then dismissed species selection from exten­sive consideration (as did Fisher) only for its presumed weakness relative to their favored genic level, and not because they doubt the theoretical validity, or even the empirical reality, of selection at this higher level. Dawkins (1982, pp. 106-107) has emphasized Fisher's argument about impotence by noting that, at most, species selection might accentuate some relatively “uninterest­ing” linear trends (like size increase among species in a lineage), but could not possibly “put together complex [organismal] adaptations such as eyes and brains.” Dawkins continues:

When we consider the species ... the replacement cycle time is the inter­val from speciation event to speciation event, and may be measured in thousands of years, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands. In any given period of geological time, the number of selective species extinc­tions that can have taken place is many orders of magnitude less than the number of selective allele replacements that can have taken place ... We shall have to make a quantitative judgment taking into account the vastly greater cycle time between replicator deaths in the species selec­tion case than in the gene selection case.



I strongly support Dawkins's last statement, but will argue (see pages 703–712) that, when we factor punctuated equilibria into the equation, species se­lection emerges as a powerful force in macroevolution (though not as an ar­chitect of complex organismic adaptations).

Williams has also supported Fisher's argument about the logic of higher level selection — even in his gene selectionist manifesto of 1966, where he de­fends the possibility, but then denies the actuality: “If a group of adequately stable populations is available, group selection can theoretically produce biotic adaptations, for the same reason that genic selection can produce organic adaptations” (1966, p. 110). In his later book, however, Williams becomes much more positive about the importance and reality of selection at several hierarchical levels: “To Darwin and most of his immediate and later follow­ers, the physical entities of interest for the theory of natural selection were discrete individual organisms. This restricted range of attention has never been logically defensible” (1992, p. 38).

The developing literature has added three “classical” arguments against higher-level selection to supplement Fisher's point that cycle times for species must be incomparably long relative to the lives of organisms. All these argu­ments share the favorable property of accepting a common logic but chal­lenging the empirical importance of legitimate phenomena — a good substrate for productive debate in science, in contrast with the confusion about con­cepts and definitions that so often reigns. In the rest of this section, I shall summarize the four classical arguments (Fisher's original plus the three addi­tions); note that they can all be effectively challenged at the level for which they were devised (“group,” or interdemic, selection); and then demonstrate that none has any strong force, in principle, against the empirical importance of the still higher level of species selection.





The classical arguments against efficacy of higher-level selection


The usual arguments against higher-level selection admit that such phe­nomena must be possible in principle, but deny any meaningful efficacy on grounds of rarity and weakness relative to ordinary natural selection upon organisms.

Weakness (based on cycle time). R. A. Fisher's classical argu­ment: How could species selection exert any measurable effect upon evo­lution? Rate and effect depend upon numbers and timings of births and deaths — to provide a sufficient population of items for differential sorting. But species endure for thousands or millions of years, and clades count their “populations” of component species in tens, or at most hundreds, and not as the millions or billions of organisms in many populations. How could species selection yield any measurable effect at all (relative to ordinary organismic se­lection) when, on average, billions of organismic births and deaths occur for each species origin or extinction, and when populations of organisms contain orders of magnitude more members than populations of related species in a clade?

Weakness (based on variability). Hamilton (1971, 1987), in de­vising arguments against interdemic selection, pointed out that variation among demic mean values for genetically relevant and selected aspects of organismic phenotypes will generally be lower than variation among or­ganisms within a population for the same features. Group selection cannot become a strong force if the mean phenotypes of such higher-level indi­viduals express such limited variation to serve as raw material for selective change.

Instability, as in Dawkins's metaphors of duststorms in the desert and clouds in the sky. This argument has also been most frequently advanced against interdemic selection. Demes, by definition, maintain porous borders because organisms in the same species can inter­breed, and members of one deme can therefore, in principle, invade and join another in a reproductive role. If such invasions become frequent and numer­ous, the deme ceases to function as a discrete entity, and cannot be called an evolutionary individual. Moreover, many demes lack cohesion on their own account, and not only by susceptibility to incursion. Demes may arise as en­tirely temporary and adventitious aggregrates of organisms, devoid of any in­herent mechanism for cohesion, and defined only by the transient and clumpy nature of appropriate habitats that may not even persist for a requisite gener­ation — as in the deme of all mice in a haystack, or all cockroaches in an urban kitchen.

Invasibility from other more potent levels, usually from below. This standard argument, related both to Fisher's first point about cycle time and to the third point about invasibility discussed just above — and classically used to question the potential evolution of altruism by interdemic selection — asks how higher-level selection could possibly become effective if its operation inherently creates a situation where more powerful, lower-level invaders can cancel any result by working in the opposite direc­tion. Suppose that interdemic selection, cranking along at its characteristic pace, increases the overall frequency of altruistic alleles in the entire species because demes with altruists enjoy differential success in competition against demes without altruists. This “leisurely” pace works well enough, but as soon as a selfish mutant arises in any deme with altruists, the advantage of this mutant in organismic selection against the altruistic allele should be so great that the frequency of altruistic genes must plummet within the deme, even while the deme profits in group selection from the presence of altruistic organisms. By Fisher's argument of cycle time, organismic selection of the self-serving should trump interdemic selection for altruism.





Overcoming these classical arguments, in practice for interdemic

selection, but in principle for species selection


Since the bulk of modern debate about higher-level selection has addressed interdemic (or so-called group) selection, the classical arguments have been framed mainly at the level just above our conventional focus upon organisms (though I predict that emphasis will shift to higher levels, particularly to spe­cies selection, as macroevolutionary theory develops). All four arguments have force, and do spell impotence for interdemic selection in many circum­stances. But, as full generalities, these arguments have failed either to dis­prove interdemic selection as a meaningful process worthy of consideration at all, or to deny the efficacy of interdemic selection in several important cir­cumstances.

I shall not review this enormous literature here (as my primary concern rests at still higher levels of selection), but I wish to note that two classes of argument grant interdemic selection sufficient strength and presence to count as a potentially major force in evolution (see Wade, 1978; Sober and Wilson, 1998). First, much mathematical modelling (and some experimental work) have adequately shown that, under reasonable conditions of potentially fre­quent occurrence in nature, group selection can assert its sway against the le­gitimate power of the four classical objections. In the cardinal example, un­der several plausible models, the frequency of altruistic alleles can increase within a species, so long as the rate of differential survival and propagation of demes with altruistic members (by group selection) overcome the admitted decline in frequency of altruists within successful demes by organismic selec­tion. The overall frequency may rise within the species even while the fre­quency within each surviving deme declines.

Second, some well-documented patterns in nature seem hard to explain without a strong component of interdemic selection. Female-biased sex ra­tios, as discussed by Wilson and Sober (1994, pp. 640-641), provide the classic example because two adjacent levels make opposite and easily tested predictions: conventional organismic selection should favor a 1:1 ratio by Fisher's famous argument (1930); while interdemic selection should promote strongly female-biased ratios to enhance the productivity of groups. Williams (1966) accepted this framework, which he proposed as a kind of acid test for the existence of group selection. He allowed that female-biased ratios would point to group selection, but denied that any had, in fact, been documented, thus validating empirically the theoretical arguments he had developed for the impotence of group selection. Williams concluded (1966, p. 151): “Close conformity with the theory is certainly the rule, and there is no convincing ev­idence that sex ratios ever behave as a biotic adaptation.” But empirical ex­amples of female-biased ratios were soon discovered aplenty (see Colwell, 1981, and numerous references in Wilson and Sober, 1994, p. 592). Some au­thors (Maynard Smith, 1987, for example) tried to interpret this evidence without invoking group selection, but I think that all major participants in the discussion now admit a strong component of interdemic selection in such results — and reported cases now number in the hundreds, so this phenomenon cannot be dismissed as an odd anomaly in a tiny corner of nature. Wil­liams now accepts this interpretation (1992, p. 49), writing, “that selection in female-biased Mendelian populations favors males, and that it is only the se­lection among such groups that can favor the female bias.”

The primary appeal of this admirably documented example lies in the usual finding of only moderate female biases — more than organismic selec­tion could allow (obviously, since any bias at all would establish the point), but less than models of purely interdemic selection predict. Thus, the empiri­cal evidence suggests a balance between adjacent and opposing levels of selec­tion — with alleles for female-biased sex ratios reduced in frequency by organ­ismic selection within demes, but boosted above the Fisherian balance (across species as a whole) because they increase the productivity of demes in which they reside, however transiently, at high frequency.

When we move to the level of species selection, the most important for macroevolutionary theory, we encounter an even more favorable situation. For interdemic selection, the classical contrary arguments had legitimate force, but could be overcome under conditions broad enough to grant the phenomenon considerable importance. For species selection, on the other hand, three of the classical arguments don't even apply in principle — while the fourth (weakness due to cycle time) becomes irrelevant if punctuated equilibrium prevails at a dominant relative frequency.

Proceeding through the classical objections in reverse order, the fourth argument about invasibility from below has strength only in particular con­texts — when, in principle, a favored direction of higher-level selection will usually be opposed by stronger selection at the level immediately below. (In the classic case, selfish organismal “cheaters” derail group selection for altru­ism. Nonetheless, while the argument of invasibility may hold for this partic­ular case — and while, for contingent reasons in the history of science, this ex­ample became the paradigm for discussion of interdemic selection — I see no reason in principle for thinking that organismal selection must always, or even usually, oppose interdemic selection. The two levels may operate simul­taneously and in the same direction, or at least orthogonally — see Wade's (1978) classic work on this subject.)

In any case, no general reason has been advanced for thinking that organis­mic or interdemic selection should characteristically oppose species selec­tion — and the argument of invasibility therefore collapses. Of course, organ­ismic selection may operate contrary to the direction of species selection — and must frequently do so, particularly in the phenomenon that older text­books called “overspecialization,” or the development of narrowly focussed and complex adaptations (the peacock's tail as a classic example) that en­hance the reproductive success of individual organisms, but virtually guaran­tee a decreased geological life span for the species. Other equally common modes of organismic selection, however, either tend to increase geological longevity (improvements in general biomechanical design, for example) or to operate orthogonally, and therefore “beneath the notice” of species selection. Since our best examples of species selection work through differential rates of speciation rather than varying propensities for extinction, and since most organismal adaptations probably don't strongly influence a population's rate of speciation (or at least don't manifest any bias for decreasing the rate), es­sential orthogonality of the two levels will often prevail in evolution.

The third argument of instability, while potent for demes, clearly does not apply to species. Sexual species are as well bounded as organisms. Just as genes and cell lineages generally do not wander from organism to organism (whereas organisms often move readily from deme to deme), neither can or­ganisms or demes wander from species to species. The reasons for such tight­ness of bounding differ between organism and species, but these two evolu­tionary individuals probably exceed all others in the strength of this key criterion. Species maintain and “police” their borders just as well as organ­isms do.

The tight bounding of an organism arises from functional integration among constituent parts, including an impermeable outer covering in most cases, and often an internal immune system to keep out invaders. The tight bounding of a species (as classically defined for sexually reproducing eukaryotes) arises from reproductive interaction among parts (organisms), with firm exclusion of parts from any other species. Moreover, this exclusion is actively maintained, not merely passively propagated, by traits that became a favorite subject of study among founders of the Modern Synthesis, especially Dobzhansky and Mayr — so-called “isolating mechanisms.” Species may lack a literal skin, but they remain just as well bounded as organisms in the sense required by the theory of natural selection.

This discussion on the validity and centrality of species as units of selec­tion highlights my only major unhappiness with Wilson and Sober's (1994) superb defense of hierarchical selection, otherwise followed closely in this book. They insist upon functional integration as the main criterion for identi­fying units of selection (vehicles in their terminology, interactors or evolution­ary individuals for others). They insist that the following question “is and always was at the heart of the group selection controversy — can groups be like individuals in the harmony and coordination of their parts” (1994, p. 591).

I do not object to the invocation of functionality itself, but rather to their narrow definition, too parochially based upon the kind of functionality that organisms display. The cohesion (or “functionality”) of species does not lie in the style of interaction and homeostasis that unites organisms by the integra­tion of their tissues and organs. Rather, the cohesion of species lies in their ac­tive maintenance of distinctive properties, achieved by joining their parts (or­ganisms) through sexual reproduction, while excluding the parts of other species by evolution of isolating mechanisms.

I much prefer and support Wilson and Sober's more general definition (1994, p. 599): “Groups are real to the extent that they become functionally organized by natural selection at the group level.” Species meet this criterion by evolving species-level properties that maintain their cohesion as evolution­ary individuals. The key to a broader concept of “functionality” (that is, the ability to operate discretely as a unit of selection) lies in the evolution of ac­tive devices for cohesion, not in any particular style of accomplishment — ei­ther the reproductive barriers that maintain species, or the homeostatic mech­anisms that maintain organisms.

The second argument of weakness based on lack of sufficient variability among group mean values also doesn't apply to species. Demes of mice from separated but adjacent haystacks may differ so little in group properties that the survival of only one deme, with replenishment of all haystacks by mi­grants from this successful group, might scarcely alter either allelic frequen­cies across the entire species, or even average differences among demes. But new species must differ, by definition, from all others — at least to an extent that prevents the reproductive merging of members. Thus, the differential success of some species in a clade must alter — usually substantially — the aver­age properties of the clade (whereas, one level down, the differential success of some demes need not change the average properties of the species very much, if at all).

The first argument about weakness due to long cycle time and small populations therefore remains as the only classical objection with potential force against species selection. And, at first glance, Fisher's argument would seem both potent and decisive. The basic observation cannot be faulted: billions of organism births usually occur for each species birth; and populations of or­ganisms within a species almost always vastly exceed populations of species in a clade. How then could species selection, despite its impeccable logic, maintain any measurable importance when conventional organismal selec­tion holds the tools for such greater strength?

The logic of Fisher's argument cannot be denied, but we must also con­sult the empirical world. Organismic selection must overwhelm species selec­tion when both processes operate steadily and towards the same adaptive “goal” — for if both levels work in the same direction, then species selection can only add the merest increment to the vastly greater power of organismic selection; whereas, if the two levels work in opposite directions, organismic selection must overwhelm and cancel the effect of species selection.

But the empirical record of the great majority of well-documented fossil species affirms stasis throughout the geological range (see next chapter). The causes for observed nondirectionality within species have not been fully re­solved, and the phenomenon remains compatible with the continuous opera­tion of strong organismic selection — for two common explanations of stasis as a central component of punctuated equilibrium include general prevalence of stabilizing selection, and fluctuating directional selection with no overall linear component due to effectively random changes of relevant environments through time. In any case, however, the observation of general stasis seems well established at high relative frequency (I would say dominant, but I also must confess my partisanship).

In this factual circumstance, since change does not generally accumulate through time within a species, organismic selection in the conventional gradualistic and anagenetic mode cannot contribute much to the direction of trends within a clade. Change must therefore be concentrated in events of branching speciation, and trends must arise by the differential sorting of spe­cies with favored attributes. If new species generally arise in geological mo­ments, as the theory of punctuated equilibrium holds, then trends owe their explanation even more clearly to higher-level sorting among species-individu­als acting as discrete entities with momentary births and stable durations in geological time.

Organismic selection may trump species selection in principle when both processes operate at maximal efficiency, but if change associated with speci­ation operates as “the only game in town,” then a weak force prevails while a potentially stronger force lies dormant. Nuclear bombs certainly make con­ventional firearms look risible as instruments of war, but if we choose not to employ the nukes, then bullets can be devastatingly effective. The empirical pattern of punctuated equilibrium therefore becomes the factual “weapon” that overcomes Fisher's strong theoretical objection to the efficacy of species selection.

(This argument provides a second example for the importance of punctu­ated equilibrium in validating the independence of macroevolutionary theory by failure of pure extrapolationism from microevolutionary dynamics. We saw previously (pp. 604–608) that punctuated equilibrium strongly fosters the argument for species as evolutionary individuals capable of operating as units of selection. We now note that punctuated equilibrium also affirms the potential strength of species selection against a cogent theoretical claim for its impotence.)

In summary, three of four classical arguments against higher-level selection do not apply to species, while the fourth loses its force in a world dominated by punctuated equilibrium. I see no barrier to the cardinal importance of spe­cies selection in the history of life.





EMERGENCE AND THE PROPER CRITERION

FOR SPECIES SELECTION





Differential proliferation or downward effect?


This subject and its literature, as I have noted throughout the chapter, have been plagued to an unusual degree by conceptual confusions and disputes about basic definitions and terminology. As an important example, and as many participants have noted (see especially Damuth and Heisler, 1988; and Brandon, 1988,1990), two quite different criteria for the definition of higher-level selection have circulated through the literature. (In most cases, they yield the same conclusion, so this situation has not produced anarchy; but in a few cases, some crucial, they may lead to different assertions, so the situation has fostered confusion.)

In the first approach, one chooses a focal level of analysis (conventionally one of the two lower levels of organism or gene), and then considers the effect of membership in a higher-level group upon fitness values of the chosen lower-level unit. If, for an identical organism, life in one kind of deme yields a fitness different from life in another kind of deme, then selection includes a group effect from the deme level. (We invoke this formulation, for example, if we argue for group selection by showing that organisms in a deme with altru­ists do better than identical organisms in a group lacking altruists.)

In the second approach, strongly favored here, we hold firm to the classi­cal bare-bones Darwinian definition, but recognize that selection can work on evolutionary individuals at many hierarchical levels. Selection has tradi­tionally been defined as the differential reproductive success of evolutionary individuals based on the fitnesses of their traits in interaction with the en­vironment. Thus, we recognize higher-level selection by the differential pro­liferation of some higher-level individuals (demes, species, clades) over oth­ers — just as we define conventional natural selection by the differential reproductive success of some organisms based on phenotypic traits that con­fer fitness.

These two approaches often yield concordant results for the obvious rea­son that differential proliferation of higher-level units (the second criterion) often defines the group effect that influences the fitness of lower-level individ­uals chosen as a focus (the first criterion). But the two criteria need not corre­spond, leading to situations where we would identify group selection by one criterion, but deny the same process by the other. For example, under the first criterion of group effects on lower-level fitness, some higher-level properties of groups can influence lower units without causing any differential repro­duction of the groups themselves. On this criterion, for example, some biolo­gists have held that frequency dependent selection must be viewed, ipso facto, as an example of group selection — a claim simply incomprehensible under the alternative criterion of differential group proliferation. (The unresolved, and perhaps largely semantic, issue of whether kin selection should be inter­preted as a form of group selection, or only an extension of conventional lower-level selection, also presupposes this criterion of group effect upon lower-level fitness — see Wilson and Sober, 1994.)

A predominantly sociological issue has often set preferences between these criteria. Paleontologists, and other students of species selection, myself in­cluded, have strongly advocated the criterion of differential reproduction for higher-level individuals as a strict and obvious analog of ordinary natural se­lection as conventionally understood. Neontologists and students of group selection have generally (though not always) preferred the criterion of “group effect on gene or organismal fitness,” both from fealty to Darwinian tradi­tions for using organisms as a primary focus, and because certain contentious issues, especially the evolution of altruism, have generally been posed in organismal terms — “why can saintly Joe be so nice if he loses reproductive success thereby?”

Three major reasons lead to my strong preference for the criterion of differential proliferation correlated with properties of relevant evolutionary individuals that confer fitness in interaction with their environment. First, we thereby follow standard definitions of selection, which have always been based on causal plurifaction, not on mere effect. Second, why would we ever prefer an elaborate and indirect definition — in terms of effects on something else at a scale far removed from the causal interaction — over a simpler ac­count rooted in the direct result of the causal process itself? Considered in these terms, the criterion of “group effect on organismal fitness” seems downright peculiar. We only entertain such a standard for contingent reasons of history and philosophical preference — the Darwinian tradition for focus­ing on organisms, and our larger scientific allegiance to reductionism. Third, we can too easily lose the force and location of causality when we study a phenomenon through indirect effects expressed elsewhere, rather than by im­mediate operation. True, we are supposed to assess the separate effects upon lower-level focal units — from deme membership, or species membership, for example. But since several higher levels may simultaneously affect a lower fo­cal unit, we may not be able to untangle the differences, and we may end up with an account of consequences, rather than causes.

As an obvious example of these pitfalls, I point out that gene-selectionism, with all its fallacies, arises from an erroneous inversion in the criterion of “group effect on lower-level fitness.” One begins with the basic statement that membership in higher-level units affects the fitness of genes. So far, so good. But if one then makes the error of assuming that replicators, rather than interactors, should be units of selection — and then chooses genes as fun­damental replicators both by general reductionistic preference, and by alle­giance to faithfulness in replication as a necessary criterion — then one be­comes tempted to misidentify effects as causes. The gene selectionist then slides down the following slippery slope: why should I talk about higher-level interactors affecting gene fitness? why don't I just consider higher-level inter­actors as one aspect of the gene's environment? in that case, why should I talk about higher-level interactors as entities at all? environment is environment, however constituted, and whether clumped into interactors housing the genes or not? in fact, why even try to identify the environment's forms of dumpi­ness? why not, instead, simply average the gene's fitness over all aspects of environment to achieve a single measure of the gene's evolutionary prowess?

This line of argument, as its least attractive feature, relentlessly dissolves causality. We begin with the causal agents of selection — interactors at various hierarchical levels. (Even the most ardent gene selectionists, as I show on pages 631–632, cannot avoid discussing the causal process of selection in terms of these interactors.) We then represent interactors by their effects on genes. Next, we decide to consider interactors only as environments of genes. Then we lose interest in their nature and action because “environmental clumping” (the “expression” of interactors in this view) does not appear to represent an important issue. Finally, we dissolve the interactors entirely by deciding to average the fitness of genes across all aspects of the environment. And, before we notice what we have really done, causality has disappeared.

In a vigorous defense of gene selection against the hierarchical view of Wilson and Sober (1994), Dawkins (tongue-in-cheek to be sure) pretends to be “baffled” by “the sheer, wanton, head-in-bag perversity of the position that they champion” (commentary in Wilson and Sober, 1994, p. 617). Such a sense of strong psychological frustration must arise when you and your oppo­nents seem to be saying the same thing, but in such utterly different ways, and to such radically different effect. Thus, Dawkins presents his gene-selectionist reformulation of Wilson and Sober's Weltanschauung (mine as well, by the way):

Selection chooses only replicators . . . Replicators are judged by their phenotypic effect. Phenotypic effects may happen to be bundled, to­gether with the phenotypic effects of other replicators, in vehicles. Those vehicles often turn out to be the objects that we recognize as organisms, but this did not have to be so ... There did not have to be any vehicles at all . . . The environment of a replicator includes the outside world, but it also includes, most importantly, other replicators, other genes in the same organism and in different organisms, and their phenotypic products.



(Note that I did not exaggerate or caricature in my previous summary; gene selectionists do regard “clumping” into vehicles as beside the point, and they do dissolve these vehicles — the true units of selection — into “environment” considered as the sum of contexts for any gene.)

Wilson and Sober (1994, p. 641) responded to Dawkins with their own frustration:

Dawkins remains so near, yet so far ... We could not ask for a better summary of the gene-centered view. The question is, are vehicles of selection absent from this account or have they merely been reconceptualized as environments of the genes. The answer to this question is obvious at the individual [organism] level, because Dawkins acknowledged long ago that individuals [organisms] can be vehicles of selection . . . despite the fact that they are also environments of the genes. The answer is just as obvious at the group level... [Dawkins's] passage does not refute the existence of vehicles, but merely assumes that the vehicle concept can be dispensed with and that natural selection can be studied entirely in terms of average genic effects.



Is this brouhaha much ado about nothing? Are the two views — selection on a hierarchy of interactors, and representation of all selective forces in terms of gene fitnesses, with interactors treated as environments of genes — truly equiv­alent, and our decision just a matter of preference, or a question of psycho­logical judgment about superior sources of insight? Is this twofold choice just another manifestation of Dawkins's old Necker Cube (see p. 640) — a flipping between two equivalent facets of reality, an example of conventionalism in philosophy?

The answer, I think, must be a clear and resounding “no.” The two alternatives represent strikingly different views about the nature of reality and causality. We all agree that we need to know causes — and natural selection is a causal process. Gene selection confuses bookkeeping (properly done at the genic level) with causality (a question of evolutionary individuals plurifying differentially, based on interaction of their phenotypes with the environ­ment). If we dissolve interactors into an overall “environment” of the genes, and then average a gene's fitness across all environments — the procedure of gene selectionism — then we lose causality.

Wilson and Sober (1994, p. 642) also reject the purely pluralist, or Necker Cube view: “There is no room for pluralism on these substantive empirical is­sues ... Group-level adaptations can be represented at the individual [organ­ism] and gene level by averaging the fitness of lower level units across higher level units. Gene- and individual-level adaptations cannot be interpreted as group adaptations without committing the errors of naive group selection, but the gene's-eye view and the individual's-eye view cannot deny the exis­tence of group-level adaptations (when groups are vehicles of selection) with­out being just plain wrong.”

Arnold and Fristrup (1982, p. 115) make the same point for the intrin­sic reality — and not just preferential status vs. other equivalent representa­tions — of species selection: “The characters that increase individual [organismic] fitness do not necessarily cause speciation or prevent extinction. Thus, it is misleading to adopt the convention of expressing all higher level trends in terms of individual [organism] level fitness.”

For all these reasons, I strongly advocate that we define higher-level se­lection as the differential proliferation of relevant evolutionary individuals based on causal interaction of their properties with surrounding environ­ments — rather than by representing the effect of higher-level membership on the fitness of a designated lower-level individual. Only in this way will we avoid a set of confusions, and two pitfalls that easily follow, one after the other, with the first as a kindly delusion, and the second as an outright error: first, a falsely pluralistic belief in the equivalency of alternative representa­tions at different levels; and, second, the siren song of gene selection as defin­ing the only legitimate level of causal analysis in evolution. Only in this way will we achieve a clear and unified view that treats each level in the same manner, and approaches each evolutionary individual with the same set of questions. With this apparatus of analysis, we can attain a coherent and comprehensive theory of hierarchical selection — the most potentially fruitful, promising, and proper expansion of the Darwinian research program now before us.





Shall emergent characters or emergent fitnesses define the

operation of species selection?


Once we agree to define higher-level selection by differential proliferation of relevant units based on interaction between their traits and the environment, then we must (above all) develop clear criteria for the definition and recogni­tion of traits in the unfamiliar world of higher-level individuals. Since we en­counter enough trouble in trying to define and parse traits for the kind of in­dividuals we know best — integral, complex, and continuous organisms like ourselves — we should not be surprised that this issue becomes particularly re­fractory at higher levels, and thus acts as a considerable impediment to the development of a rigorous theory of hierarchical selection. In particular, what should count, for purposes of defining evolutionary interaction with the environment, as a trait of a species?

The developing literature on this subject has featured a rich and interest­ing debate between two quite different approaches that, nonetheless, can be united in a coherent way to form the basis of a unified macroevolutionary theory of selection: the “emergent character” approach, as particularly cham­pioned by Elizabeth Vrba (1983, 1984b, 1989; Vrba and Eldredge, 1984; Vrba and Gould, 1986); and the “emergent fitness” approach inherent in the classic paper of Lewontin (1970), developed and defended in the important work of Arnold and Fristrup (1982), given further mathematical form in Damuth (1985), and Damuth and Heisler (1988), and most fully codified and expressed by Lloyd (1988 — see also Lloyd and Gould, 1993; and Gould and Lloyd, 1999).

Grantham (1995), in an excellent review of hierarchical theories of macroevolution, has christened this discussion “The Lloyd-Vrba Debate,” so the issue has now even acquired a proper name. The codification makes me feel a bit strange, since I have written papers on the subject with both protagonists (Gould and Vrba, 1982; Vrba and Gould, 1986; Lloyd and Gould, 1993; Gould and Lloyd, 1999), and do not view the issue as dichotomous; though the two viewpoints are surely distinct, and I have changed my mind — as a for­mer supporter of Vrba's “strict construction,” who became convinced that Lloyd's more inclusive formulation forges a better match with conventional definitions of selection, and provides more promise for constructing an oper­ational theory. But Lloyd does not disprove Vrba; rather, Vrba's exclusive do­main becomes a subset of “best cases” in Lloyd's formulation. In this crucial sense, the theories sensibly intermesh.

Vrba's “emergent character” approach requires that a trait functioning in species selection be emergent at the species level — basically defined as origin by non-additive interaction among lower-level constituents. Since all science works within particular sociological and historical circumstances, we must understand that the greatest appeal of this strict criterion lies in its ability to “fend off” the conventional objection to species selection in a Darwinian and reductionistic world — namely, that the trait in question, although describable as characterizing a species, “really” belongs to the constituent, lower-level parts — and that the causal process therefore reduces to ordinary Darwin­ian natural selection on organisms or genes. For, when Vrba's criterion of emergence holds, one can't, in principle, ascribe the trait in question to lower levels. The trait, after all, does not exist at these lower levels. It makes a “first appearance” at the species level, for the trait arises through non-addi­tive interaction of component lower-level parts or influences. If one species proliferates differentially within a clade by higher rates of speciation based upon such populational traits as geographic range, or density of packing among organisms, then we cannot ascribe selection to the organismic level — for organisms, by the logic of definition, cannot possess a population density, while the geographic range of a species need not correlate at all, or in any simple way, with the size of an organism's personal territory during its life­time.

The strength of the “emergent character” criterion lies in its ability to iden­tify a set of hard-line, unambiguous cases for species selection. For we must speak of selection among species if the relevant trait not only doesn't exist at any lower level, but can't even be represented as a linear combination of lower-level parts — for the nonadditive interactions that build the populational trait only arise within the population, and make no sense outside such an aggregation.

But we soon begin to worry that such a criterion may be too restrictive in eliminating a wide variety of traits that we intuitively view as features of populations, but that do not arise by nonlinear interaction of subparts, and do not therefore qualify as emergent by Vrba's criterion (which also matches the standard definition of the important concept of emergence in philosophy). Species and other higher-level individuals also develop features that seem to “belong” to them as an entity, but that arise additively as “aggregate” or “sum-of-the-parts” characters. Consider the mean value of a trait? This fig­ure belongs to no individual and becomes, in this legitimate sense, a character of the population. But a mean value doesn't “emerge” as a functional “or­gan” of the population by nonlinear interactions among organisms. A mean value represents an aggregate character, calculated by simple summation, fol­lowed by division.

And how shall we treat variability — an even more “intuitive” candidate for a species-level character that may be important in survival and proliferation of species? An individual organism doesn't possess variability, so the prop­erty belongs to the species. But variability also represents an aggregate char­acter — another average of sum-of-the-parts. Do we not want to talk about species selection when species B dies because constituent organisms show no variation for a trait that has become strongly inadaptive in the face of envi­ronmental change — while species A lives and later multiplies because the same trait varies widely, and includes some states that can prosper in the new circumstances? Yes, species B dies because each of its parts (organisms) ex­pires. In this sense, we can represent extinction as a summation of deaths for organismal reasons. But don't we also want to say that A survived by virtue of greater variability — a trait that does not exist at the organismal level, but that surely interacted with the new environment to preserve the species?

Vrba's solution, which I greatly respect but now regard as less useful than the alternative formulation, requires that we not designate differential prolif­eration of species based on aggregate characters of populations as species se­lection — but rather that we interpret such cases as upward causation from the traditional organismal level. Vrba (1980 et seq.) has coined and developed the term “effect hypothesis” for such situations — since the differential prolifera­tion of species A vs. species B arises as an effect of organismal properties (of the individuals in species A that vary in the “right” direction), resulting in the survival of species A.

Vrba, and (I think) all other major workers in this area, have always re­garded the effect hypothesis as a macroevolutionary theory because, in a heu­ristic and descriptive sense, one must apply the notion to species considered as items of evolutionary history. But events under the effect hypothesis are causally reducible to the traditional organismic level. (This kind of situation represents the minimal claim for an independent macroevolutionary theory — the need for descriptive engagement at the level of species, even if no distinct causality emerges at this higher level. This book defends the stronger claim for important causal uniqueness at the species level and above. Vrba, of course, also advocates this stronger version because she argues that some cases of differential species proliferation arise by the effect hypothesis, while others occur by true species selection based on emergent characters. I advo­cate a much larger role for causal uniqueness by defending the emergent fitness approach, a criterion that greatly expands the frequency and impor­tance of species selection.)

To facilitate this distinction, Vrba and I developed a terminology to re­solve a common confusion in evolutionary theory between the simple, and purely descriptive, observation of differential reproductive success — which we named “sorting” — and the causal claim — always and properly called “se­lection” — that observed success arises from interaction between properties of the relevant evolutionary individual and its environment (see Vrba and Gould, 1986). Evolutionary biology needs this distinction because students of the field have often — with misplaced confidence in selection's ubiquity and exclusivity — made a case for selection based on nothing more than an obser­vation of differential reproductive success (sorting), without any attempt to elucidate the cause of such sorting. A leading textbook, for example, pro­claimed that “selection ... is differential survival and reproduction — and no more” (Futuyma, 1979, p. 292).

Under Vrba's criterion of emergent characters, differential species proliferation by the effect hypothesis counts only as sorting at the species level — since the characters responsible for selection belong to organisms, but transfer an effect to the species level by upward causation. On the other hand, differen­tial species proliferation based on emergent species characters does count as selection at the species level. However, under the broader criterion of emer­gent fitness, any species-level trait that imparts an irreducible fitness to spe­cies in their interaction with the environment defines a true process of selec­tion at the species level, whether the trait itself is aggregate or emergent.

In the “emergent fitness” approach, we do not inquire into the history of species-level traits that interact with the environment to secure differential proliferation. We do not ask where the traits originated in a structural or tem­poral sense — that is, whether such traits arose by emergence at the species level, or as aggregate features by summation of properties in component or­ganisms or demes. We only require that these traits characterize the species and influence its differential rate of proliferation in interaction with the envi­ronment. In other words, we only demand that aspects of the fitness of the species be emergent and irreducible to the fitnesses of component organisms. For cases where species function as interactors, or potential units of selection, Lloyd and Gould write (1993, pp. 595-596):

Interactors, and hence selection processes themselves, are individuated by the contributions of their traits to fitness values in evolutionary mod­els; the trait itself can be an emergent group property or a simple summa­tion of organismic properties. This definition of an entity undergoing se­lection is much more inclusive than in the emergent character approach, since an entity might have either aggregate or emergent characters (or both) ... The emergent fitness approach requires only that a trait have a specified relation to fitness in order to support the claim that a selection process is occurring at that level. ... In other words, the interactor's fitness covaries with the trait in question.



In a classic example, much discussed in the literature (Arnold and Fristrup, 1982; Gould, 1982c; Lloyd and Gould, 1993; Grantham, 1995), several clades of Tertiary gastropods show trends to substantial decrease in relative frequency of species with planktotrophic larvae vs. species that brood their young. In one common explanation (by no means universally accepted), this reduction occurs by species sorting based on the lower speciation rate of planktotrophic species — an hypothesized consequence of the lower probabil­ity for formation of isolates in species with such widespread and promiscuous larval dispersal. The sorting clearly occurs by selection, since low speciation rate arises as a consequence of interaction between traits of interactors and their environment. But at what level does selection occur?

Under the emergent character approach, the case becomes frustrating and ambiguous. Does the crucial property of “low speciation rate” in planktotrophs result from an emergent species character? In one sense, we are tempted to answer “yes.” Organisms, after all, don't speciate; only popula­tions do — so mustn't the trait be emergent at the population level? But, in an­other sense, low speciation rate arises as a consequence of population struc­tures induced by planktotrophy, a presumed adaptation at the organismal level — so perhaps the key character can be reduced to simple properties of or­ganisms after all.

I have gone round and round this example for twenty years, often feeling confident that I have finally found a clear resolution, only to recognize that a different (and equally reasonable) formulation yields the opposite interpreta­tion. All other participants in this debate seem equally afflicted by frustration, so perhaps, the fault lies in the concepts, and not in ourselves that we seem to be underlings, unable to achieve closure.

However, if we invoke the broader criterion of emergent fitness, the prob­lem gains a clear resolution in favor of species selection. A structural feature of populations, leading to a low frequency of isolation for new demes, must be treated as a character of populations in any conventional usage of lan­guage. As stated above, individual organisms don't speciate; only populations do — so the character belongs to the species. However, the character may rep­resent an aggregate rather than an emergent feature — thus debarring species selection under the emergent character approach. But, under the emergent fitness approach, so long as the character (whether aggregate or emergent) belongs to the species, and so long as the fitness of the species covaries with the character — and no one denies the covariation in this case — we have de­tected an instance of species selection.

Arnold and Fristrup (1982, p. 114) present this argument in a clear and forceful way:

The critical characters — larval strategies — may well have arisen for rea­sons that can be seen as adaptive in a traditional Darwinian sense. How­ever, regardless of the mechanism by which they became fixed, these strategies behave as properties of species in that they result in distribu­tions of rates of speciation and extinction within this group ... It might be tempting to assume that there are fewer planktotrophic species be­cause the individuals in these species were somehow less fit than the indi­viduals in non-planktotrophic species. However, it is obvious that the same result could obtain even if planktotrophic and non-planktotrophic individuals [organisms] have equal fitnesses, by virtue of the population structures that are concomitants of these larval strategies. Thus, the ob­served distribution of species types within these gastropods is not pre­dicted from individuals’ level fitness alone, underscoring the necessity of the higher level of analysis.



In other words, the relative frequency of planktotrophic species falls not because planktotrophic organisms must be less fit (they may, in fact, be more fit on average across the clade), but because a character fixed by organismic selection yields the effect of lowering the speciation rate at a higher level. The population structure produced by planktotrophy may not rank as an emer­gent character, but does confer an emergent fitness at the species level — a fitness irrelevant to individual organisms, which, to emphasize the obvious point one more time, do not speciate.

Finally, we may seal the case by citing Grantham's important argument (1995, p. 301) that “species selection does not require emergent traits be­cause higher-level selection acting on aggregate traits can oppose lower-level selection.” Vrba herself has argued (1989, p. 80) that “the acid test of a higher level selection process is whether it can in principle oppose selection at the next lower level.” Surely such an opposition can arise “in principle” (and probably in actuality) in this case — for planktotrophy could be positively se­lected at the organismic level, but may, through its strong effect on popula­tion structure, and the resulting consequences for rates of speciation, enjoin negative selection at the species level.

To summarize, we all agree that an independent theory of macroevolution must identify higher-level causal processes that are not reducible to (or simple effects of) causes operating at conventional lower levels of gene and organism. This premise defines the theoretical salience of the debate about species selection — for if such a process exists, and can also be validated as both com­mon in evolution and irreducible in principle, then macroevolutionary theory has been achieved. For this reason, evolutionary biologists, who usually es­chew academic philosophy (as the mildly philistinistic culture of science gen­erally dictates), have joined in such classical philosophical debates as the meaning of reduction and emergence.

Vrba's criterion of emergent characters establishes an obvious case for irreducibility because the trait that causes species selection can claim neither existence nor representation at the conventional organismic level. Grantham writes (1995, p. 308): “When a component of species-level fitness is corre­lated with an emergent trait, this correlation cannot be reduced because the trait cannot be represented at the lower level.” But Lloyd's broader criterion of emergent fitness also establishes irreducibility, even if the trait involved in the correlation between trait and fitness is reducible under the effect hypo­thesis. In Lloyd's case, the fitness is irreducible (as shown practically in the previous example of gastropod lineages, where higher-level fitness based on speciation rate opposes lower-level fitness based on the same trait of larval adaptation). The technical point may be summarized in the following way: selection is defined by the correlation between a species-level trait and spe­cies-level fitness; therefore, the irreducibility of either component of the corre­lation establishes irreducibility for the selection process. Grantham notes (1995, p. 308): “Emergent traits are not, however, necessary for species selec­tion. If an aggregate trait affects a component of species-level fitness (e.g. rate of speciation) and this component of fitness is irreducible, then the trait-fitness correlation will be irreducible.”

Vrba's emergent character approach embodies one great strength, but two disarming weaknesses. This criterion does identify the most irrefutable, and in many ways the most interesting, subset of cases for species selection — ex­amples based on genuine species adaptations (for an emergent character that evolved as a consequence of its value in fitness is, ipso facto, an adaptation); whereas nonemergent characters that contribute to species fitness via the ef­fect hypothesis are exaptations (Gould and Vrba, 1982; Gould and Lloyd, 1999), at the species level (and adaptations at the lower level of their origin).

But the emergent character criterion suffers from two problems that would render the theory of species selection, if framed exclusively in its light, eter­nally contentious and, perhaps, relatively unimportant as well. First, by in­cluding only the “hardest-line” cases within the concept, we may be unduly limiting species selection to an unfairly small compass. (For example, and as an analogy, we wouldn't want to restrict the concept of “adaptation” only to the small subset of true biomechanical optima — for most adaptations only hold the status of “better than,” not ne plus ultra). Second, emergence can of­ten be extremely difficult to document for characters — so, in practice, the concept may be untestable in most circumstances. To differentiate between a truly emergent species character and an effect of a lower-level character, one often needs a great density of narrative information about the actual history of the lineage in question — information only rarely available in the fossil re­cord, not to mention our spotty archives for living species.

By contrast, the emergent fitness approach enjoys the great virtue of fully general applicability. For, when one only has to consider current circum­stances (the trait-fitness correlation), and need not reconstruct prior history (as the designation of emergence for a species-level character so often re­quires), then we can study any present reality that offers enough information for a resolution. We certainly use this most broadly applicable, nonhistorical approach in traditional studies of natural selection at the organismic level — that is, we identify current selective value whether the feature conferring dif­ferential reproductive success arose as an adaptation for its current contribu­tion to fitness, or got coopted for its present role from some other origin or utility. (In other words, both preadaptations and spandrels — features that arose as adaptations for something else, or for no adaptive purpose at all — can function just as well in a regime of current selection as true adaptations forged by the current regime.) The historical origin of characters, and their later shifts in utility, constitute a central and fascinating question in evolu­tionary theory — and provide a main theme for Chapter 11 of this book. But we define the process of selection ahistorically — as differential reproductive success based on current interaction between traits of evolutionary individu­als and their environments — that is, the concept of selection remains agnostic with respect to the historical origin of the traits involved.

The emergent fitness approach presents four favorable features that estab­lish species selection as a central, fully operational, and vitally important sub­ject in evolutionary biology — thereby validating both the necessity and the distinctness of macroevolutionary theory.

1. Rather than depending upon a documentation of prior history in the narrative mode (often untestable for lack of information), we move to a fully general mathematical model that can, in principle, identify components of higher-level selection in any case where we can obtain sufficient data on the current operation of a selection process. Arnold and Fristrup (1982) expanded Price's (1970, 1972) covariance formulae to encompass a set of nested levels, and devised an approach closely allied to analysis of covariance, considering selection at one level as a “treatment effect” upon selection at an adjacent level. Damuth and Heisler (1988) developed a similar method, also based on covariances (or regression of fitness values on characters); this pro­cedure has been expanded by Lloyd (1988; Lloyd and Gould, 1993). As Lloyd and Gould (1993, p. 596) describe the method: “This is done by de­scribing interactors at the lower level first. If a higher-level interactor exists, the higher-level correlation of fitness and trait will appear as a residual fitness contribution at the lower level; we must then go to the higher level in order to represent the correlation between higher-level trait and higher-level fitness.”

Lest this method seem to fall into the very reductionistic trap that species selection strives to overcome — because we begin at the lowest level and only move higher if we find a residual fitness — I point out that we use this proce­dure only as a convenient and operational research method, and decidedly not with the reductionistic hope that no residuals will appear, and that the lowest level will therefore suffice for a full explanation. We may be stuck with the technical term “residual” as a common statistical usage in such circum­stances — but there is nothing conceptually residual about higher-level selec­tion. Selection at lower levels cannot be designated as more true or basic, with higher levels then superadded if necessary. The statistical “residual” of our procedure exists as a separate but equal natural reality in our fascinating world of hierarchical selection.

2. The emergent fitness approach establishes a large and general realm for the operation of species selection. Any evolutionary trend that must be de­scribed, at least in part, as a result of species sorting automatically becomes subject to the analytical apparatus here proposed, and therefore a candidate for identification of species selection. (And I can hardly imagine that any im­portant trend unfolds without a major — I would say almost always predomi­nant (see Chapter 9) — component of species sorting, for extensive anagene­sis rarely occurs in single lineages, and none can persist very long without branching in any case.)

3. The emergent fitness approach allows us to use a single, familiar, and minimalist definition of selection in the same manner at each level — differen­tial proliferation of evolutionary individuals based on interactions of their traits with the environment. We therefore achieve a unified theory of selection at all scales of nature. The availability of a fully operational analytical appa­ratus, connected with this definition, greatly enhances the scientific utility of emergent fitness as a definition of species selection.

4. As an admittedly more subjective and personal point, the emergent fitness approach allows us to encompass under the rubric of species selection several attributes of populations that many participants in this debate have intuitively wished to include within the causal compass of species acting as evolutionary individuals, but which the more restrictive emergent character approach rules out. Many of us have felt that two distinct kinds of species properties should figure in species selection because, for different reasons, such features cannot function at the lower and traditional level of organismic selection. In the first category, emergent characters of species obviously can't operate at the organismic level because they don't exist for organisms. These features clearly serve as criteria of species selection in either the emergent character or the emergent fitness approach.

In a second category, some important aggregate characters of species can't function in selection at the organismic level, not because they have no expres­sion at this lower level (for they clearly exist as organismic properties, at least in the form of traits that aggregate additively to a different expression at the species level), but because such properties do not vary among organisms, and therefore supply no raw material for selection's necessary fuel. I speak here of a common phenomenon recognized by different jargons in various sub-disciplines of our field — autapomorphies for cladists, or invariant Bauplan characters for structuralists. Suppose that each species in a clade has evolved a unique state of a homologous character — and that, within each species, all organisms develop the same state of the character, without meaningful variation. In this situation, all variation for the homologous character oc­curs among species, and none at all within species. If a trend now develops within the clade when some species live and proliferate because they possess their unique state of the character, while others die because their equally dis­tinct and unvarying state has become maladaptive in a changed environment, should we call such a result species selection — for each species manifests a single attribute, and all variation occurs among species? Interestingly, de Vries originally coined the term species selection (see pages 448–451) for pre­cisely this situation, where no relevant variation exists within species, and all variation occurs among species.

To summarize: in the first situation, the character doesn't exist at the organismal level, and each species develops only one state of the (emergent) character because the character belongs to the species as a whole. Therefore, selection for this character can only occur among species. In the second situa­tion, the character doesn't vary at the organismal level, and each species in a clade has evolved a unique and different state of the character. Again, selec­tion can only occur among species. In either situation, each species manifests one different and unvarying state of a feature that cannot operate in organismic selection — so selection for this feature can only occur among species.

The emergent status of the character leads us to designate the first situation as species selection without any ambiguity or alternative. But we balk at des­ignating the second situation as species selection because the relevant species-level character (lack of variation) represents an aggregate, not an emergent, feature. The emergent fitness criterion rescues us from this dilemma, and forges an intuitive union between the two situations by designating both as species selection. Lack of variation — the aggregate species character — in­teracts with the environment to influence differential rates of proliferation among species. This character imparts an emergent fitness to the species, and therefore becomes an agent of species selection. (After all, the species doesn't die because organism A, or B, or C, possesses a trait that has become mal­adaptive; the species dies because none of its parts (organisms) can develop any other form of the trait — and this lack of variation characterizes the spe­cies, not any of its individual organisms.)

I believe that such “species selection on variability” — the title that Lloyd and I gave to our 1993 paper — will prove to be a potent style of selection at this level. (When I was struggling with the issue of whether such an aggregate character as variability could count as a property of species, I asked Egbert Leigh, a brilliant evolutionist and the leading late 20th century disciple of R. A. Fisher, whether he thought that variability could operate as a character in species selection — and he replied: “if variability isn't clearly a character of a species, then I don't know what is.”)

To cite just one hypothetical example that I have often used to illustrate this issue and to argue for species selection on variability: Suppose that a wondrously optimal fish, a marvel of hydrodynamic perfection, lives in a pond. This species has been honed by millennia of conventional Darwinian selection, based on fierce competition, to this optimal organismic state. The gills work in an exemplary fashion, but do not vary among individual organ­isms for any option other than breathing in well-aerated, flowing water. An­other species of fish — the middling species — ekes out a marginal existence in the same pond. The gills don't work as well, but their structure varies greatly among organisms. In particular, a few members of the species can breathe in quite stagnant and muddy waters.

Organismic selection favors the optimal fish, a proud creature that has lorded it over all brethren, especially the middling fish, for ages untold. But now the pond dries up, and only a few shallow, muddy pools remain. The op­timal fish becomes extinct. The middling species persists because a few of its members can survive in the muddy residua. (Next decade, the deep, well-aer­ated waters may return, but the optimal fish no longer exists to reestablish its domination.)

Can we explain the persistence of the middling species, and the death of the optimal form, only by organismic selection? I don't think so. The middling species survives, in large part, as a result of the greater variability that al­lowed some members to hunker down in the muddy pools. (We may even ar­gue that the optimal fish always prevailed against most members of the mid­dling species, even at the worst time, so that most middlings died quickly when the pond dried, while the optimals hung on longer, but eventually suc­cumbed.) The middling species survived qua species because the gills varied among its parts (organisms), not because all its members gained advantage when the environment changed. (For most middling organisms continued to fare worse than the optimal fishes.) We may represent this story at the organismal level by discussing the gills of the few middling fishes that carried the species through the crisis. But the middling species prevailed by species selection on variability — for this greater variability imparted an emergent fitness to the interaction of the species with the changed environment.

Species selection on variability also possesses the salutary property of unit­ing the two major themes of this book, the concepts that I regard as the most important revisions now needed to mend and strengthen the two main legs of the essential Darwinian tripod: the hierarchical theory of natural selection as a vibrant expansion of Darwin's focus on the organismal level, and the centrality of constraint as a channeler of evolutionary direction in concert with natural selection (which can no longer maintain the exclusivity that strict Darwinians wished to impart). An important component for explaining the patterning of life's history lies in limitations and channels imposed and re­tained by developmental architecture — and these constraints do much of their work at higher levels, in large part by influencing “species selection on variability.”

I close this discussion with three points that validate the status of spe­cies selection as an irreducible macroevolutionary force, and place the pro­posed criteria of emergent characters and emergent fitnesses under a common rubric.





THE FALLACY OF “NECKER CUBING” The philosophical doctrine of conventionalism, as expressed by Dawkins (1982) in his Necker Cube metaphor (see pages 640–641), presents an important challenge to claims for an inde­pendent macroevolutionary theory based on higher-level selection. For if all cases of higher-level selection, however cogently defended, represent only one legitimate way to describe a process that can always be causally expressed in terms of selection at conventional lower levels as well, then why bother (ex­cept for the fun of it, or for the psychological insight thus provided) with the alternative higher level, when the traditional Darwinian locus invariably works just as well?

I do not doubt that some evolutionary events can be alternatively expressed (and I shall mention one category under my second point below), but Necker cubing will not apply to genuine cases of irreducible species selection because the nature of the world (not the conventions of our language) regulates the lo­cus of causality. Two reasons debar the Necker cube for true cases of species selection. First, for Vrba's “hardest” category of species selection based on emergent characters, no expression at conventional lower levels can be for­mulated because the relevant species character does not exist at the usual Darwinian locus of organisms. Second, for Lloyd's broader category of spe­cies selection based on the emergent fitness associated with aggregate species characters, the “Necker cubers” commit a basic error in logic. They correctly note that the aggregate character can be represented at the organismic level — so they invoke the conventionalism of alternative and equally valid expres­sion. But, as discussed on page 659, the species-level fitness imparted by the aggregate character, not the character itself, denotes the irreducible feature that defines species selection on this criterion.

In other words, Necker cubers commit the same error in this case that Dawkins made in his original use of the metaphor to claim that all organismal selection can also be expressed in terms of gene selection. The metaphor of the Necker cube only applies when the same thing attains equal and alter­native representation, not when the Cube's two versions represent genuinely different aspects of a common phenomenon. In Dawkins's original error, something can always be represented at the gene level — but that something counts as bookkeeping, not as the causality of selection, which remains organismal in his standard cases. Similarly, for aggregate species-level charac­ters involved in selection, something can always be represented at the organ­ismic level — but that something, in this case, only involves the composition of the character, not the causal process of selection, which occurs irreducibly at the species level as identified by emergent species-level fitnesses.





A UNIFIED PICTURE OF SPECIES SELECTION In advocating such an expanded role for species selection, we must guard against the ultimate fallacy of claiming too much — for if we turn all forms of species sorting into species selection by verbal legerdemain, then we falsely “win” by definition, but ac­tually lose by an overly imperialistic extension that permits no distinctions and therefore sacrifices all utility as an empirical proposition in science. Fortunately, we can unite both criteria of emergent fitnesses and characters into a unified scheme that establishes two realms of species selection, one more in­clusive than the other, but that also identifies a domain of species sorting lead­ing us to reject causation by species selection.

Grantham (1995) has presented such a scheme, reproduced here as Figure 8-4. (I had independently developed the same system, almost with the same picture, in preparing to write this chapter. I mention this not to compromise Grantham's originality or priority in any way — for priority is chronology, and his cannot be gainsaid! — but to express the firm and almost eerie satisfac­tion that such a “multiple” formulation brings (see Merton, 1965), and to of­fer this example as proof that the inherent logic of a complex argument often drives independent researchers to a definite and almost ineluctable result-validating in this case the coherence of this “take” on species selection.)

Grantham's diagram circumscribes two realms of species selection, labeled as “hierarchical explanations.” The A realm contains Vrba's firmest examples based on emergent characters, while the B realm adds Lloyd's cases based on the emergent fitnesses associated with aggregate species-level characters. (Vrba, of course, would restrict species selection to the A realm, and ascribe the B realm to the “effect hypothesis” — but everyone seems to agree on the structure and relationships of the realms.) The A realm seems firmer because emergent characters count as adaptations of species, and maintain no expression





8-4. Grantham's 1995 epitome of criteria for invoking species selection in hierarchical models. The A domain includes rare best cases of species selection based on emergent species-level traits. The B domain adds aggregate traits that affect irreducible species-level fitness, and therefore also participate in species selection under the interactor approach. The aggregate and reducible traits of the C do­main belong only to organisms and cannot figure in arguments for species selec­tion.





at lower levels. The B realm seems “looser” because these aggregate spe­cies characters can be represented at the organismic level, even though they may also rise by upward causation to become exaptations of species (Gould and Vrba, 1982; Vrba and Gould, 1986; Gould and Lloyd, 1999). But, in any case, the resulting species-level fitnesses are irreducible — so the B realm also represents species selection by standard definitions of selection as a causal process.

The C realm includes cases of species sorting based on aggregate species-level characters that impart only a reducible fitness at the species level — and therefore do not count as species selection. One might add a D realm at the base for cases describable as species sorting, but not associated with any higher-level character, either aggregate or emergent, and therefore not quali­fying for consideration as species selection on any definition of species as evolutionary individuals and inter actors. The D realm, which may be quite large, includes several categories, most obviously species sorting based on the higher-level analog of drift — or random differentials in survival and death of species within a clade (see my summary chart, pp. 718–720).

As for any scientific theory, we want, most of all, to be able to make clear and testable distinctions at the crucial boundary between cases that affirm and cases that fall outside the hypothesis under consideration — in this case, between the B and C realms separating irreducible species selection from spe­cies sorting reducible to organismic selection. In these formative days for the theory of species selection, we have not yet developed a full set of firm crite­ria for making these crucial allocations. But let me suggest one guidepost at the outset. Ever since this literature began, astute workers have devel­oped a strong intuition that species sorting based on events of differential birth (speciation rates) will usually represent true species selection, while species sorting based upon differential death (extinction) will often be reduc­ible to organismic level (see Gilinsky, 1981; Arnold and Fristrup, 1982; Vrba and Eldredge, 1984; Grantham, 1995; Gould and Eldredge, 1977; Gould, 1983c).

The source of this intuition — which may turn out to be both wrong, and superficially based — arises from a sense that the extinction of a species may often be adequately explained simply as the summed deaths of all organisms, each for entirely organismal reasons and with no significant contribution from any species-level property. When the last reproductive organism dies, the species becomes extinct. But how could a new species originate without some involvement of population-level features? After all, individual organ­isms do not speciate; only populations do. But individual organisms die, and the extinction of a species might, at least in principle, represent no more than the summation of these deaths. Grantham expresses this common intuition particularly well (1995, pp. 309-310):

The concept of “speciation rate” cannot be expressed at the organismic level because there is no simple set of organismic traits that determine speciation rate. Rather, a diverse set of organismic and population-level traits (including dispersal ability, population structure, and behavioral compatibility between members of distant populations) affect gene flow and therefore affect speciation rates. Because of the large variety of fac­tors affecting speciation rate . . . the higher level property of “speciation rate” is, at best, extraordinarily difficult to express in organismic terms. The speciation rate of a taxon is irreducible ... A species goes extinct if and only if every individual dies. Whereas differences in speciation rates cannot be expressed in organismic terms, differences in extinction rates will often be reducible (unless population-level traits such as variation matter).



Thus, I suspect that the A and B realms will be heavily populated with cases based on differential speciation, whereas the C realm will feature cases based on differential extinction.





A PERSONAL ODYSSEY Many historians of science, particularly feminists like Donna Harraway (1989, 1991), have forcefully argued that scholars can strike their most effective blows against the myth of pure objectivism by being candid about the interaction of their own autobiographies with their current claims — thus exposing the inevitable (and basically welcome) cultural and psychological embeddedness of science, while opening an author's prejudice both to his own scrutiny, and to the examination of his readers. To do so ob­sessively or promiscuously in a book of this sort would only clutter a text that would then become even more insufferably egocentric or idiosyncratic — so I have usually desisted (except for some parts of Chapter 1, and the dubious in­dulgence of my appendix to Chapter 9). But I will follow Harraway's recom­mendation in this particular case, because no other subject in evolutionary theory has so engaged and confused me, throughout my career, as the defini­tion and elucidation of species selection. For no other problem have I made so many published mistakes, and undergone so many changes of viewpoint be­fore settling on what I now consider a satisfactory framework. Moreover, my basic reason for current satisfaction rests upon an interesting correction from within my own body of work — and, though I remain heartily embarrassed for not grasping both the inconsistency and the necessary resolution many years earlier, I do take some pleasure in my eventual arrival — and I do think that the story may help to illustrate the intellectual coherence of the frame­work now proposed in this book.

I made two sequential errors of opposite import. When Niles Eldredge and I first formulated punctuated equilibrium, I was most excited by the insight that trends would need to be reconceptualized as differential success of spe­cies, rather than anagenesis within lineages (a theme only dimly grasped in Eldredge and Gould, 1972, but fully developed in Gould and Eldredge, 1977, after much help from Stanley, 1975, and later from Vrba, 1980). I then com­mitted the common fallacy of extending personal excitement too far — and I made the error (as we all did in these early days of “species selection” under punctuated equilibrium) of labelling as species selection any pattern that needed to be described in terms of differential success for species treated (un­der punctuated equilibrium) as stable entities. In other words, we failed to distinguish selection from sorting, and used the mere existence of sorting at the species level as a criterion for identifying species selection. This definition of species selection must be rejected as clearly wrong — particularly for the in­valid “promotion” of several cases properly viewed as effects of causes fully reducible to conventional organismic selection.

In reaction to this previous excess, I then retreated too far in the other direction, by restricting species selection too severely — i.e., only to cases based on characters emergent at the species level (Gould, 1983c; Vrba and Gould, 1986). My later work with Elizabeth Lloyd (Lloyd and Gould, 1993; Gould and Lloyd, 1999) convinced me that emergent character, while properly identifying species selection, only identified a subset of genuine cases, and that emergent fitness, as defended in this section, provided a conceptually broader, and empirically more testable criterion.

In preparing this chapter, I finally realized why I had originally erred in restricting species selection to emergent characters. The source for amending Vrba and Gould (1986) lay in an earlier paper that I had written with Elisa­beth Vrba (Gould and Vrba, 1982), particularly in the codification of adapta­tion (or the origin of a character directly for its current utility) and exaptation (or the cooptation of a preexisting character for an altered current utility) as subsets of the more inclusive phenomenon of aptation (any form of current utility, whatever the historical origin).

We developed this terminology, which has now been widely accepted (see extensive discussion in Chapter 11), in order to make a crucial, but often disregarded, distinction between “reasons for historical origin” and “basis of current utility.” The common conflation of these entirely separate notions has engendered enormous confusion in evolutionary theory — a situation that we documented and tried to correct in our paper (Vrba and Gould, 1986). Hardly any principle in general historical reasoning (not only in evolutionary theory) can be more important than clear separation between the historical basis of a phenomenon and its current operation. For example, crucial com­ponents of current utility often arose nonadaptively as spandrels, or side-consequences, of other features actively constructed or evolved (Gould and Lewontin, 1979).

I felt so enlightened by this distinction, and so committed (as a paleontolo­gist and historian) to the special role of historical origin, that I longed to ap­ply this notion to the important concept of species selection. I therefore con­cluded that we should not speak of species selection unless the character that imparted the relevant fitness could be identified as a true adaptation at the species level — that is, as a feature belonging to the species as a higher-level Darwinian individual, and evolved directly for current utility in promoting the differential success of the species. Emergent species characters qualify as adaptations — and I therefore felt drawn to this narrow criterion for identify­ing species selection.

In so doing, I committed a basic logical error about the nature of selection. However much I may love history, selection cannot be, and has never been, defined as a historical relationship of character and result. Selection must be defined by present operation, as identified by an observable differential in reproductive success based on the current interaction of a trait of a Darwinian individual with its environment. This definition includes no reference to the historical origin of any relevant trait, which may be either an adaptation or an exaptation. Damuth and Heisler (1988) emphasize this crucial point, with an apt literary flourish at the end to note the irrelevancy of a trait's “aristoc­racy” (depth of historical origin, or “blue-blooded” continuity) to the hierar­chy of selection:

The historical origin of a character is irrelevant to the way that it func­tions in a selection process. Thus, the issue of whether a character is a group or individual “adaptation,” and whether it has been shaped for its present role by any particular process, is of no importance in the study of the selection mechanism. There may certainly be historical significance in such observations about the origin of characters. Nevertheless, selection evaluates characters in terms of their current relationship to fitness only, not in terms of their history. There is hierarchy in the world of natural selection, but no aristocracy.



Once I recognized the irrelevancy of historical origin to the identification of selection — my only previous rationale for insisting that characters for species selection must be species-level adaptations, and therefore emergent at the spe­cies level — I understood that the “emergent character” criterion must be re­jected as too restrictive (while correctly identifying the firmest subset of cases for species selection), whereas the “emergent fitness” criterion must be pre­ferred, as not only legitimately broader in scope, but also properly formu­lated in terms of conventional definitions of selection. In my own preferred nomenclature, species-level characters that are exaptations rather than adap­tations can function perfectly well in species selection. Aggregate species-level characters originate as exaptations of species because they arise at the organismal level and pass upwards as effects to the species level. When I mistakenly thought that characters for species selection had to be species-level adapta­tions, I had excluded aggregate characters (as species-level exaptations), and therefore falsely rejected the emergent fitness approach (see Gould and Lloyd, 1999, for an elaboration of this argument).

In the early 1980's, my own students Tony Arnold and Kurt Fristrup had strongly urged the criterion of emergent fitness upon me, and I well remember my bitter disappointment that I could not convince them to use the restrictive criterion of emergent characters! (I had not yet developed the nomenclature of adaptation and exaptation, and therefore did not yet possess the personal tools for a conceptual resolution.) Thus, my error reflected an active commit­ment (not a passive consequence of inattention), maintained in the face of an available correction that I now regard as one of the finest papers ever pub­lished on the subject (Arnold and Fristrup, 1982). I did not grasp, for another decade, how the terminology developed by Vrba and me also derailed the criterion that we both preferred. To sum up: selection operates on current utili­ties, and remains agnostic about historical origins in utilizing both adapta­tions and exaptations with equal facility. Emergent species-level characters will generally count as adaptations, thus clearly available for species selec­tion. But all aggregate species-level characters represent potential exapta­tions, and therefore become equally available for species selection under the proper criterion of emergent fitness.

I would, however, salvage a lesson from this odyssey of errors. Vrba and I were not wrong in identifying emergent characters as especially interesting (we only erred in deeming them necessary for species selection). Emergent characters belong exclusively to the species. As adaptations, they become part of the defining cohesion that permits a species to function as an evolutionary individual. Emergent characters thus stand out in designating the style of in­dividuality maintained by species. Aggregate characters, on the other hand, do not clearly define a species as a functional entity (variability, for example, represents an attribute, not an “organ,” of a species) — for aggregate charac­ters belong as much to the component organisms, as to the entire species. Thus, emergent characters are special and fascinating (though not essential to the definition and recognition of species as legitimate Darwinian individu­als — see Gould and Lloyd, 1999). Emergent characters do deserve primary consideration in discussions about the structural basis of species both as nat­ural entities in general, and as the basic individuals of macroevolution in par­ticular. But we do not require emergent characters to identify a process of se­lection.

As a final note, and as one contribution to recognizing the crucial and characteristic differences among Darwinian individuals at the six primary levels of the evolutionary hierarchy, we should suspect that species selection will emphasize exaptations, whereas organismal selection employs a higher rela­tive frequency of adaptations — for species, as more loosely organized in func­tional terms than organisms, probably possess far fewer emergent characters than organisms. But species “make up” for their relative paucity of adapta­tions by developing a higher frequency of exaptations. Most of these exaptations derive their raw material from adaptations at the organismal level that cascade upwards to effects at the species level. By joining fewer ad­aptations (emergent characters) with more exaptations (usually based on ag­gregate characters), species may become just as rich as organisms in features that can serve as a basis for selection. Species selection may therefore become just as strong and decisive as conventional Darwinian selection at the level of organisms — a process whose power we do not doubt, and whose range we once falsely extended to encompass all of nature.





HIERARCHY AND THE SIXFOLD WAY





A literary prologue for the two major properties of hierarchies


Our vernacular language recognizes a triad of terms for the structural de­scription of any phenomenon that we wish to designate as a unitary item or “thing.” The thing itself becomes our focus, and we call it an object, an entity, an individual, an organism, or any one of a hundred similar terms, depending on the substance and circumstance. The subunits that build the individual are then called “parts” (or units, or components, or organs, etc., depending upon the nature of the focal item); while any recognized grouping of similar indi­viduals becomes a “collectivity” (or aggregation, society, organization, etc.). In other words, and in epitome, individuals are made of parts and aggregate into collectivities.

The hierarchical theory of selection recognizes many kinds of evolutionary individuals, banded together in a rising series of increasingly greater inclu­sion, one within the next — genes in cells, cells in organisms, organisms in demes, demes in species, species in clades. The focal unit of each level is an in­dividual, and we may choose to direct our evolutionary attention to any of the levels. Once we designate a focal level as primary for a particular study, then the unit of that level — the gene, or the organism, or the species, etc. — be­comes our relevant or focal individual, and its constituent units become parts, while the next higher unit becomes its collectivity. Thus, if I place my focus at the conventional organismic level, genes and cells become parts, while demes and species become collectivities. But if my study enjoins a focus on species as individuals, then organisms become parts, and clades become collectivities. In other words, the triad of part — individual — collectivity will shift, as a three­fold entirety, up and down the hierarchy, depending upon the chosen subjects and objects of any particular study.

This dry linguistic point becomes important for a fundamental reason of psychological habit. We humans are hidebound creatures of convention, particularly tied to the spatial and temporal scales most palpably familiar in our personal lives. Among nature's vastly different realms of time, from the femtoseconds of some atomic phenomena to the aeons of stellar and geologi­cal time, we really grasp, in a visceral sense, only a small span from the sec­onds of our incidents to the decades of our lives. We can formulate other scales in mathematical terms; we can document their existence and the pro­cesses that unfold in their domains. But we experience enormous difficulty in trying to bring these alien scales into the guts of or our understanding — largely for the parochial reason of personal inexperience.

We make frequent and legendary errors because we tend to extrapolate the styles and modes of our own scale into the different realms of the incomprehensibly immense or tiny in size, vast or fleeting in time. Geologists, for ex­ample, well appreciate the enormous difficulties that most people encounter (including our professional selves, despite so many years of training and experience) in trying to visualize or understand the meaning of any ordinary statement in “deep” or “earth time” — that a landscape took millions of years to develop, or that a lineage exhibits a trend to increasing size throughout the Cretaceous period. All of us — professionals and laypeople alike — continue to make the damnedest mistakes. I have, for example, struggled for thirty years against the conventional misreading of punctuated equilibrium as a saltational theory in the generational terms usually applied to such a concept in evolutionary studies. The theory's punctuations are only saltational on geo­logical scales — in the sense that most species arise during an unmeasurable geological moment (meaning, in operational terms, that all the evidence ap­pears on a single bedding plane). But geological moments usually include thousands of human years — more than enough time for a continuous process that we would regard as glacially slow by the measure of our lives (see Goodfriend and Gould, 1996, for an example). Thus, punctuated equilibrium represents the proper geological scaling of speciation events that may span several thousand years, not a slavish promotion of “instantaneity,” as con­ventionally measured in a human time frame, to the origin of species.

As we misunderstand scales of time, we fail just as badly with viscerally unfamiliar realms of size. Our bodies lie in the middle of a continuum ranging from the angstroms of atoms to the light years of galaxies. Individuality exists in all these domains, but when we try to understand the phenomenon of “thingness” at any distant scale, we easily fall under the thrall of the greatest of all parochialisms. We know one kind of individual so intimately and with such familiarity — our own bodies — that we tend to impose the characteristic properties of this level upon the very different styles of being that other scales generate. This inevitable human foible provokes endless trouble, if only be­cause organismal bodies represent a very peculiar kind of individual, serving as a very poor model for the comparable phenomenon at most other scales.

The “feel” of individuality at other scales becomes so elusive that most of the best exploration has been accomplished by literary figures, not by scien­tists. The tradition extends at least as far back as Lemuel Gulliver, whose “alien” contacts did not depart greatly from our kind of body and our norm of size. This theme has best been promoted, in our generation, within the genre of science fiction. I particularly recommend two “cult” films, Fantastic Voyage and Inner Space, both about humans reduced to cellular size and in­jected into the body of another unaltered conspecific. This ordinary body be­comes the environment of the shrunken protagonists, a “collectivity” rather than a discrete entity — while the “parts” of this body become individuals to the shrunken guests. When Raquel Welch fights a bevy of antibodies to the death in Fantastic Voyage, we understand how location along the triadic continuum of part — individual — collectivity depends upon circumstance and concern. A tiny, if crucial, part to me at about two meters tall becomes an en­tire and ultimately dangerous individual to Ms. Welch at a tiny fraction of a millimeter.

The parochiality of time has served us badly enough, but the parochiality of bodily size has, for two reasons, placed even more imposing barriers in our path to an improved and generalized evolutionary theory — a formulation well within our grasp if we can learn how to expand the Darwinian perspec­tive to all levels of nature's hierarchy. First, we know almost viscerally what our bodies do best as Darwinian agents — and we then grant universal impor­tance to these properties both by denying interest to the different “best” properties of individuals at other levels, and by assuming that our “bests” must, by extension, power Darwinian systems wherever they work. Our bodies are best at developing adaptations in the complex and coordinated form that we call “organic.” Many evolutionists therefore argue, in the worst pa­rochialism of all, that only adaptations matter as an explanatory goal of Dar­winism, and that such adaptations must therefore drive evolution at all levels. I don't even think that such a perspective works well for organisms — surely the locus of most promising application (Gould and Lewontin, 1979) — but this attitude will surely stymie any understanding of individuality at other levels, where complex adaptations do not figure so prominently. Evolutionists will not be able to appreciate the different individuality of species, where exaptive effects hold at least equal sway with adaptations, if they continue to regard spandrels, sequelae, and side consequences as phenomena generated by “the boring by-product theory” (Dawkins, 1982, p. 215).

Second, we just don't comprehend the scale-bound realities in other do­mains of size, and we err by imposing our own perceptions when we try to think about the world of a gene, or of a species. In one of the most famous statements of 20th century biology, D'Arcy Thompson (1942, p. 77) ended his chapter “On Magnitude” (in his classic work, On Growth and Form — see the first section of Chapter 11 for a general analysis of his work) by noting how badly we misread the world of smaller organisms because our large size places us in gravity's domain (a result of low surface/volume ratios in larger creatures, but not a significant feature in other realms of size). If we encoun­ter so much trouble for extremes within our own level of organismic individ­uality, how will we grasp the even more distant worlds of other kinds of evo­lutionary individuals? D'Arcy Thompson wrote (1942, p. 771):

Life has a range of magnitude narrow indeed compared to that with which physical science deals; but it is wide enough to include three such discrepant conditions as those in which a man, an insect, and a bacillus have their being and play their several roles. Man is ruled by gravitation, and rests on mother earth. A water beetle finds the surface of a pool a matter of life and death, a perilous entanglement or an indispensable support. In a third world, where the bacillus lives, gravitation is forgot­ten, and the viscosity of the liquid, the resistance defined by Stokes's law, the molecular shocks of the Brownian movement, doubtless also the electric charges of the ionized medium, make up the physical environ­ment and have their potent and immediate influence on the organism. The predominant factors are no longer those of our scale; we have come to the edge of a world of which we have no experience, and where all our preconceptions must be recast.



As one example, consider the difficulty we experience, despite our preferences for reductionism in science, when we try to visualize the world of our genes, where nucleotides function as active and substitutable evolutionary parts — and where chromosomes build a first encasement, followed by nuclei and cells, with our body now serving as an entire universe, whose death will also destroy any gene still resident within. Think of the initial resistance that most of us felt towards Kimura's neutralist theory — largely because we falsely “downloaded” our adaptationist views about organisms into this different domain, where high frequencies of neutral substitution become so reasonable once we grasp the weirdly (to us) divergent nature of life at such infinitude. And if we fare so badly for the small and immediate, supposedly so valued by our reductionist preferences, how can we comprehend an opposite extension into the longer life, the larger size, and the markedly different character of species-individuals — a world that we have usually viewed exclusively as a col­lectivity, an aggregation of our bodies, and not as a different kind of individ­ual in any sense at all?

I like to play a game of “science fiction” by imagining myself as an individ­ual of another scale (not just as a human being shrunken or enlarged for a visit to such a terra incognita). But I do not know how far I can succeed. As organisms, we have eyes to see the world of selection and adaptation as ex­pressed in the good design of wings, legs, and brains. But randomness may predominate in the world of genes — and we might interpret the universe very differently if our primary vantage point resided at this lower level. We might then note a world of largely independent items, drifting in and out by the luck of the draw — but with little islands dotted about here and there, where selec­tion slows down the ordinary tempo and embryology ties things together. How, then, shall we comprehend the still different order of a world much larger than ourselves? If we missed the strange world of genic neutrality be­cause we are too big, then what passes above our gaze because we are too small? Perhaps we become stymied, like genes trying to grasp the much larger world of change in bodies, when we, as bodies, try to contemplate the do­main of evolution among species in the vastness of geological time? What are we missing in trying to read this world by the inappropriate scale of our small bodies and minuscule lifetimes?

Once we have become mentally prepared to seek and appreciate (and not to ignore or devalue) the structural and causal differences among nature's richly various scales, we can formulate more fruitfully the two cardinal prop­erties of hierarchies that make the theory of hierarchical selection both so in­teresting and so different from the conventional single-level Darwinism of organismal selection. The key to both properties lies in “interdependence with difference” — for the hierarchical levels of causality, while bonded in in­teraction, are also (for some attributes) fairly independent in modality. More­over, these levels invariably diverge, one from the other, despite unifying prin­ciples, like selection, applicable to all levels. Allometry, not pure fractality, rules among the scales of nature.





1. Selection at one level may enhance, counteract, or just be orthogonal to selection at any adjacent level. All modes of interaction prevail among levels and make prominent imprints in nature.

I emphasize this crucial point because many students of the subject have focussed so strongly on negative interaction between levels — for a sensible and practical reason — that they verge on the serious error of equating an opera­tional advantage with a theoretical restriction, and almost seem to deny the other modes of positive (synergistic) and orthogonal (independent) interac­tion. Negative interaction wins primary heuristic attention because this mode provides our most cogent evidence, not merely for simultaneous action of two levels, but especially for the operation of a controversial or unsuspected level. If two levels work in synergism, then we easily miss the one we do not expect to see, and attribute the full effect to an unsuspected strength for the level we know. But if the controversial level yields an unexpected effect con­trary to the known direction of selection at a familiar level, then we may be able to specify and measure the disputed phenomenon.

In the example cited previously, individual selection favors a balanced sex ratio, while interdemic selection leads to female bias in many circumstances. Our best evidence for the reality of interdemic selection emerges from the dis­covery of such biases — not so strong as purely interdemic selection would produce (for organismic selection operates simultaneously in the other direc­tion), but firm enough to demonstrate the existence of a controversial phe­nomenon. But if interdemic selection also worked towards a 1:1 ratio, we could attribute such an empirical finding exclusively to the conventional op­eration of organismic selection.

Negative interaction, however, does yield one distinguishing consequence to highlight this mode as especially important in the revisions to evolutionary theory that the hierarchical model will engender. In conventional one-level Darwinism, stabilities generally receive interpretation as adaptive peaks or optima, thus enhancing the functionalist bias inherent in the theory. The ma­jor structuralist intrusion into this theme ordinarily occurs when we have been willing to allow that natural selection can't surmount a constraint — ele­phants too heavy to fly even if genetic variability for wings existed; insects confined to small sizes by the inherited Bauplan of an exoskeleton that must be molted, and a respiratory system of skeletal invaginations that would be­come too extensive at the surface/volume ratio of large organisms. But the constraints in these cases act as passive walls, not active agents.

The hierarchical theory of selection suggests a theoretically quite different and dynamic reason for many of nature's stabilities: an achieved balance, at an intermediary point optimal for neither, between two levels of selec­tion working in opposite directions. Several important phenomena may be so explained: weak female bias as the negative interaction of organismal and interdemic selection (see above); restriction of multiple copy number in “selfish DNA” as a balance between positive selection at the gene level, sup­pressed by negative selection (based, perhaps, on energetic costs of produc­ing so many copies irrelevant to the phenotype) at the organismic level. I also suspect that stable and distinctive features of species and clades must repre­sent balances between positive organismic selection that would drive a fea­ture to further elaboration, and negative species selection to limit the geo­logical longevity of such “overspecialized” forms. In any case, a world of conceptual difference exists between stabilities read as optima of a single pro­cess, and stabilities interpreted as compromises between active and opposed forces.

As an example of overemphasis upon negative interaction, Wilson and Sober (1994, p. 592) ask: “Why aren't examples of within-individual [organ­ism] selection more common?” They mention the most familiar case of meiotic drive, and then discuss the conventional argument for rarity of such phenomena: the integrity of complex organisms implies strong balance and homeostasis among parts; therefore, any part that begins to proliferate inde­pendently will threaten this stability, and must therefore be disfavored by organismic selection, a force generally strong enough to eliminate such a threat from below.

If selection within bodies generally opposes the organismic level, as this discussion implies, then we properly expect a low frequency for the phenome­non, since evolution has endowed the organismic level with a plethora of de­vices for resisting such dysfunctional invasion from within. Although I accept this argument for a low frequency of selection contrary to the interests of en­closing organisms, selection within bodies may not be so rare when we in­clude the other modalities of synergistic and orthogonal directions. The most interesting hypothesis for extensive selection at the gene level, the notion originally dubbed “selfish DNA” (Orgel and Crick, 1980; Doolittle and Sapienza, 1980), attributes the observed copy number of much middle-repetitive DNA to orthogonal gene-level selection initially “unnoticed” by the organ­ism, though eventually suppressed by negative selection from above when copies reach sufficient numbers to exact an energetic drain upon construction of the phenotype (see fuller discussion on pp. 693–695). In fact, I suspect that organismic complexity could never have evolved without extensive gene-level selection in this orthogonal (or synergistic) mode. For if we accept the com­mon argument that freedom to evolve new phenotypic complexity requires genetic duplication to “liberate” copies for modification in novel directions, then how could such redundancy arise if organismic selection worked with such watchdog efficiency that even a single “extra” copy, initially unneeded by the organismic phenotype, induced strong negative selection from above, and immediately got flushed out — thus, in an odd sense, making the organism a delayed Kamikaze, killing its “invader” now and, by summation of such consequences, itself later?

Leo Buss (1987), in a fascinating book on the role of hierarchical selection in the phylogenetic history of development (see pp. 696–700 for further dis­cussion), offers a compelling case for the vital importance of both synergistic and negative selection between levels in the history of life, which he views largely as a tale of sequential addition in hierarchical levels — so that nature's current hierarchy becomes a problem for historical explanation, not an inher­ent structure fully present throughout time. Buss argues that synergism must fuel the first steps in adding a new level atop a preexisting hierarchy (for ini­tial negativity against the previous highest level would preclude the origin of a new level). But, having once achieved a tentative foothold, the new level sta­bilizes best by imposing negative selection against differential proliferation of individuals at the level just below — for these individuals have now become parts of the new level's integrity, and selection at the new level will tend to check any dysfunctional imbalance caused by differential proliferation from below.





2. Each hierarchical level differs from all others in substantial and interest­ing ways, both in the style and frequency of patterns in change and causal modes. Nature's hierarchy, for all the commonality of its unifying principles (selection, for example, acting at each level), does not display fractal structure with self-similarity across levels.

As the theory of hierarchical selection develops, I predict that no subject within its aegis will prove more fascinating than the varying strengths and modalities among levels. Just as the study of allometry has recorded charac­teristic and predictable scale-dependent differences in structure and function of organisms at strongly contrasting sizes — a prominent subject in biology ever since Galileo formulated the principle of surfaces and volumes in 1638, and so elegantly codified in D'Arcy Thompson's masterpiece of both prose and concept, On Growth and Form (1917, second edition, 1942) — so too does individuality as a tiny gene imply substantially different properties for a unit of selection than “personhood” as a large species or an even larger clade. Allometric effects across hierarchical levels should greatly exceed the familiar (and extensive) differences between tiny and gigantic organisms for two un­surprising reasons (see Gould and Lloyd, 1999, for a detailed development of this argument). First, the size ranges among levels are far greater still. Second, organisms share many common properties simply by occupying a common level of evolutionary individuality despite an immense range of size; but the levels themselves differ strongly in basic modes of individuality, and therefore develop far greater disparity.

But this promise also implies a corresponding danger. In some famous lines composed for a quite different, but interestingly related purpose, Alexander Pope explored the paradox of man's intermediary status between two such disparate extremes, both so desperately needed to know and to understand (the bestial and the godly in Pope's concern) — but both so inscrutable as so far from our own being:





Placed on this isthmus of a middle state,

A being darkly wise and rudely great...

He hangs between; in doubt to act or rest;

In doubt to deem himself a god, or beast...

Created half to rise, and half to fall;

Great lord of all things, yet a prey to all;

Sole judge of truth, in endless error hurl'd;

The glory, jest, and riddle of the world!





I appreciate this image of an “isthmus of a middle state” — a narrow standing place linking two larger worlds of smaller and greater. Pope's dilemma may pack more emotional punch in its moral meaning (since his greater and lesser worlds define questions of value rather than geometry), but our problem fea­tures greater intellectual depth — for, surely, a larger conceptual chasm sepa­rates the gene from the clade in modes of evolutionary mechanics, than the bestial from the virtuous in styles of human behavior.

The problem can be summarized with another, and much older, classical quotation. “Man is,” as Protagoras, wrote in his wonderfully ambiguous epigram, “the measure of all things” — ambiguous, that is, in embodying both positive and negative meanings: positive for humanistic reasons of ubiquitous self-valuing that might lead to some form of universal brotherhood and com­passion; but negative because our own “measure” can be so parochially limit­ing, and therefore so conducive to misunderstanding other scales if we must assess these various domains by the allometric properties of our limited es­tate.

This issue becomes especially serious for the hierarchical theory of selec­tion. Humans hold status as both evolutionary individuals and organisms — yet all other “separate but equal” evolutionary individuals at other hierarchi­cal levels are not organisms. Unfortunately, organisms constitute a very spe­cial and distinctly odd kind of evolutionary individual, imbued with unique properties absent from (or much weaker in) other individuals (at other levels) that are equally potent as evolutionary agents. But if we mistakenly regard our own unique properties as indispensable traits for any kind of evolution­ary individual — the classic error of parochialism — then we will devalue, or even fail to identify, other individuals defined by different properties and resi­dent at other levels.

I shall explore some of these crucial differences in the next two sections (disparate properties of the six major levels; and extensive comparison of organisms and species as evolutionary individuals). In this introductory com­ment, I only wish to emphasize that the uniqueness of the organism as a unit of selection lies in securing individuality by maximal homeostatic interaction among parts, an integration that ties each subpart to the fate of all, and there­fore strongly discourages any “breakout” or differential proliferation (by suborganismic selection) from within. To be sure, such integration represents a powerful strategy for individuation, but this strategy does not specify the only legitimate path, and other potent evolutionary individuals use other mechanisms. For this reason, I regret that Wilson and Sober (1994) so em­phasize these “organic” properties of individuality in their general definition, meant to apply to all levels. This parochial focus leads them to downplay the individuality of units of selection at other levels, where different defini­tional criteria predominate — in species, for example, where the maintenance of boundaries by reproductive isolating mechanisms, and the mixture of sub-parts in replenishment (sexual reproduction), maintain cohesion and stability just as well as organisms do by the different strategies of homeostasis and functional interaction of subparts.





Redressing the tyranny of the organism: comments on

characteristic features and differences among six

primary levels


I have little tolerance for numerical mysticism. I feel no special affinity for threes (as trinities), fours (Jung's primal archetype), fives (for fingers or echinoderms), sevens (for notes of the musical scale, planets in the Ptolemaic sys­tem, and so much else), or nines (the trinity of trinities). Similarly, in recogniz­ing six hierarchical levels for this discussion — genes, cells, organisms, demes, species, and clades — I only utilize a device of convenience, and do not make any assertion about a fixed number of units in the expanded hierarchy of Darwinian action.

Any such claim of definity could only rank as both foolish and incoherent for at least two reasons. First, the hierarchy has not been set by structural or logical principles, but historically evolved in a contingent manner. Thus, be­fore the inventions of sexual reproduction and multicellular organisms, nei­ther species nor organisms (as a level distinct from cells) existed, and a quad­ripartite hierarchy held sway (and still does today in the dominant world of asexual unicells) — gene, cell, clone, and clade. Second, several of the levels discussed here coagulate numerous phenomena because they lie between two clear boundaries. As Buss (1987) points out, for example, we might, in cer­tain contexts, recognize several items that encase genes but serve as parts of multicellular organisms: chromosomes, organelles, cells, organs, etc. Before the multicellular organism evolved, and began to act with such effectiveness as a suppressor of intraorganismic selection, we might have construed this domain of “proto-individuality” quite differently, and with finer resolution.

As a second argument against granting necessary or inherent status to these six levels, I have followed nearly all students of this field in preferring a fully nested hierarchy of increasing inclusion, to other legitimate interactors that function only occasionally, transiently, or in special circumstances. This fully nested hierarchy operates with Linnaean logic in requiring that lower units amalgamate completely, and under strict genealogical constraint — so that no lower unit can belong to more than one higher unit, while no higher unit can “forage” outside its hereditary line to incorporate the lower units of other distinct evolutionary branches at the same level. Just as a genus can't belong to two families, a species of flies cannot incorporate some onychophores and a few myriapods to construct a more versatile species-individual.

We logically require this property of nesting to correlate the nonhistorical process of selection with a set of quintessentially historical phenomena in evolutionary biology, including phylogenetics and the study of adaptation. Without such a fully inclusive hierarchy, for example, we could not use one level as a surrogate or convenient descriptor for events at other levels in the same nest — as when we choose the gene level for keeping the general books of evolution (see pp. 632–637 on the error of gene selectionism).

Nature, of course, does not always obey this logical stricture, though we may appeal to the empirical success of this formulation as an indicator that nature does comply at a preponderant relative frequency. If life did not gener­ally work within a hierarchy of inclusion, the biotic world would present such a different appearance that our conventional ordering devices would not operate usefully, and would never have been proposed or accepted. (I am not a naive realist, and I have argued throughout this book that we impose our social preferences upon nature in constructing our theories. But nature does provide a strong input, and does impose a powerful constraint upon our formulations.) No one would ever have suggested a nested system like Linnaeus's, if common experience proclaimed that novel taxa generally arise by distant amalgamation — if, for example, each new mammal arose by a principle of “disparate thirds,” say with equal mixtures of dugong, aardvark, and howler monkey. (We all know, of course, though we rarely discuss the subject in polite company, that the Linnaean logic, which presupposes a to­pology of branching without amalgamation, cannot apply to groups that do show massive mixture, as in some families of plants with extensive hybridiza­tion, or especially in prokaryotes evolving with frequent lateral transfer — a phenomenon that, on accumulating evidence, may be common enough to truly discombobulate the Linnaean version for the pre-multicellular majority of life's tree (see Doolittle, 1999), with practical and theoretical consequences as broad as any revolutionary discoveries in the recent history of evolutionary biology.) Similarly, we all appreciate the conceptual difficulties imposed by some prominent cases in evolution, mostly at the genic or cellular level, that do violate the hierarchy of inclusion — most notably, the origin of some organelles as symbiotic prokaryotes.

Since units of selection operate as interactors with the environment, and since entities obeying the criteria of “personhood” (see pages 602–613) do occasionally cohere by distant genealogical amalgamation, nature does pres­ent some exceptions to the principle of a fully nested hierarchy for evolution­ary individuals. But these exceptions truly function as the “rule provers” of our mottoes (in the sense of probing, or testing, our generalities), and not as falsifiers. The most widespread cases, including the origin of cellular organelles by endosymbiosis, represent “frozen” phenomena of history, not active amalgamations presently building evolutionary individuals by junction of disparate genealogical lines. (However, genic exceptions, as noted above, may be rife if lateral transport occurs as frequently as current theory and data are now beginning to suggest, especially for prokaryotes.) The most common, ac­tive cases involve symbiotic and coevolutionary unions tight enough to obey the Biblical rule of Naomi and Ruth: “whither thou goest, I will go.” Wilson and Sober (1989), for example, present a fascinating discussion of “phoretic associations,” or obligate carriage, by wingless insects as they move among resource patches, of various mites, nematodes, fungi, and microorganisms. In some cases, the load of these “hangers on” can disable or even kill the insect, and conventional Darwinism will then work in its usual, competitive, and organismic mode. But the phoretic associates may be limited to densities that do not affect the insect, and may also provide resources indispensable for suc­cessful colonization of new patches — in which case, the entire association may be evolving as a “superorganism.”

With these caveats in mind — the somewhat arbitrary division of the evolutionary hierarchy into six levels, and the acknowledgment of interesting exceptions to full nesting among nature's various individuals — I shall try to specify some distinctive “allometric” properties of the levels and their inter­actions:





THE GENE-INDIVIDUAL As we enter this first unfamiliar world of such great, and literally basic, importance to evolution, we encounter an initial rung of strong difference from the organism-individuals that, if only for psychological reasons, must stand as prototypes for our parochial concept of how a proper Darwinian unit must function in natural selection. If we could ever truly grasp the gene's world, with full sympathy and appreciation for rel­ative frequencies, hard-line selectionism would yield to a fascinating enlarge­ment that would actually strengthen selectionist theory by synergism with other (non-contradictory) forces — so this subject should therefore not intimi­date strict Darwinians. For the most part, however, the necessary acknowl­edgment of different gene-level processes has unfolded within the traditional perspective of organismic selection — with three basic categories of interpreta­tion as “good” for organisms, and acceptable on this basis; “bad” for organ­isms, and a destabilizing danger that must be conquered; or irrelevant to or­ganisms and therefore unimportant.* The implications for a hierarchical reconstruction of evolutionary theory have therefore been missed or downplayed. Consider the two major themes of recent literature:



Motoo Kimura and the ‘neutral theory of molecular evolution.” Although I have called this book “the structure of evolution­ary theory,” I have propagated my own lamentable parochialism under a pre­tense of generality. For this book, despite its exuberant length, largely re­stricts itself to the Darwinian tradition of conventional causal explanations based on selection as a central mechanism. I do, to be sure, treat the major critiques of unbridled selectionism (constraints as channels, failure of pure extrapolationism into geological time), but I conduct this discussion within a Darwinian world, and do not adequately consider truly alternative mecha­nisms of change and their domains of operation. Since selection is a causal theory of change based on distinctive traits of definable individuals within specified environments (quite apart from any stochastic sources for the varia­tion that provides raw materials of change), the obvious first-line alternative to selection must lie in random reasons for change itself.

As a basic statement in the logic of an argument, this point can hardly be denied, and therefore enjoys a long history of recognition in evolution­ary thought. But recognition scarcely implies acceptance. The Victorian age, basking in the triumph of an industrial and military might rooted in technol­ogy and mechanical engineering, granted little conceptual space to random events, so the issue barely arose in Darwin's own time. (Darwin got into enough trouble by invoking randomness for sources of raw material; he wasn't about to propose stochastic causes for change as well! To this day, a distressingly familiar vernacular misunderstanding of Darwinism rests upon confusing these two components (sources of raw material and causes of change) — as in the common charge that Darwinism must be wrong because human complexity couldn't arise by purely random processes. Nineteenth century theories of probability also eschewed ontological randomness in fa­vor of causal production by interaction of so many fundamentally orthogo­nal mechanisms that stochastic formulations would best fit the observed results — the philosophical solution traditionally adopted by the scientific determinists who invented probability theory, most notably by Laplace him­self.)

For these primarily societal reasons, theories of random change enjoyed lit­tle currency before our own century, when for both external reasons of a new cultural context (spawned by such events as the breakup of colonial empires, the devastation of World Wars, and the consequent questioning of predict­able progress as time's direction), and internal prods from the mathematical apparatus of population genetics, random models of change became a major and controversial subject in evolutionary theory. I shall not review this well-known story, centering on the life and work of Sewall Wright (see Wright's own magnificent four-volume summing up, and Provine's fine biography). I only need to remind readers that genetic drift (often called “the Sewall Wright effect” in early literature), while unimpeachable in theory, and therefore surely operative in nature, received very short shrift, especially as the Modern Synthesis hardened around its adaptationist core (see Chapter 7). The Synthe­sis did not and could not deny genetic drift; instead, supporters resorted to the classical argument for dismissal in natural history — relegation to insig­nificant relative frequency. I learned the argument as a near mantra in all my graduate classes during the mid 1960's: fixation by genetic drift can only oc­cur in populations so tiny that most will already be on the brink of extinction.

Genetic drift at the traditional organismic level enjoys far more respect and currency today, but the basic argument of the Synthesis does have merit at this hierarchical level. Sexually-reproducing, multicellular organisms gener­ally share two properties that greatly limit the efficacy of genetic drift: they live in populations far too large for random fixation in the face of nearly any measurable selection pressure; moreover, the style of individuality manifested by organisms, based on well-balanced functional integration among sub-parts, renders the traits of these interactors particularly subject to scrutiny by natural selection.

Do these good reasons for demoting random change at the organismic level doom this alternative style of evolution to weakness or impotency through­out the hierarchy? Clearly not, as the recent history of our profession proves; moreover, we may even invert the standard hope for extrapolation from the level we know best, and assert instead that the organismic level discourages random change as a peculiarity of individuality in this realm — and that ana­logs of genetic drift at other levels should expect healthy, if not dominant, relative frequencies.

All evolutionists also know that ideas of random change have enjoyed greatest success, based on inherent plausibility, at the genic level, where the so-called “neutral theory of molecular evolution,” most strongly associated with the great Japanese geneticist Motoo Kimura (1968, 1983, 1985, 1991a and b), but initiated and developed by others as well (Jukes, 1991), has often been hailed as the most interesting revision of evolutionary theory since Darwin.

When we consider the two properties of organisms that depress the fre­quency of fixation by drift at this level, we easily spot the difference that makes randomness so important at the lower genic level. Population size, also characteristically large for gene-individuals, cannot supply the reason. But the workings of DNA establish a strong supposition for absence of selective pressure from the organismal level at a high percentage of nucleotide sites, where alternative states do not influence the phenotypes of organisms — hence the designation of drift at this level as the neutral theory of molecular evo­lution.

Kimura's classical categories of evidence all depend upon the observation that maximal rates of nucleotide change occur at sites that do not influence the organismal phenotype — on the reasonable assumption that organismal selection usually acts in the stabilizing mode to preserve favorable sequences, and that sites under selective influence must therefore change at less than the maximal rate. The threefold confirmation of this prediction provides power­ful evidence for the neutral theory — (1) for synonymous substitutions of the third nucleotide in a triplet; (2) for much higher rates of change in untrans­lated introns than in surrounding exons; and (3) for entirely untranslated pseudogenes, where rates at all three positions of triplets match the rapid third-position rate for translated DNA.

The move from mere plausibility to the important claim for high, or even dominant, relative frequency arises both by implication from the basic theory, and from observation. The three phenomena described above, after all, in­clude a large percentage of all nucleotide changes — so neutralism must main­tain a high relative frequency at this level if we have interpreted the rates of change correctly. At the broadest scale of geological time, the (admittedly ap­proximate) ticking of the molecular clock in so many phylogenetic studies achieves its most plausible reading as a consequence of generally comparable rates for the high percentage of neutral substitutions. (The alternate explana­tion of averaging out for fluctuating selective control over sufficiently long periods of time cannot be dismissed a priori, but smacks of special pleading — whereas neutralism expects this result as the consequence of a central propo­sition.)

Kimura has always stressed the high frequency of neutral substitutions as his main challenge to Darwinian traditions. He writes, for example (1991a, p. 367), “in sharp contrast to the Darwinian theory of evolution by natu­ral selection, the neutral theory claims that the overwhelming majority of evolutionary changes at the molecular level are caused by random fixation (due to random sampling drift in finite populations) of selectively neutral (i.e., selectively equivalent) mutants under continued inputs of mutations.” At the same time, Kimura also consistently insisted — and not, I think, merely for diplomacy's sake, or for any lack of resolve, but rather with genuine conviction (I discussed the matter several times with Kimura in person, so I will also stand as witness) — that the neutral theory did not contradict or dethrone Darwinism, but should rather be integrated with natural selection into a more complete and more generous account of evolution. Most neutral changes, after all, occur “below” the level of visibility to conventional Dar­winian processes acting at the organismic level. Moreover, although most nucleotide changes may be neutral at their origin, the variability thus provided may then become indispensable for adaptive evolution of phenotypes if envi­ronmental change promotes formerly neutral substitutions to organismic visi­bility — an important style of cross-level exaptation (Vrba and Gould, 1986; Gould and Lloyd, 1999) that may serve as a chief prerequisite to the evolu­tion of substantial phenotypic novelty. Kimura writes, for example (1985, p. 43): “Of course, Darwinian change is necessary to explain change at the phenotypic level — fish becoming man — but in terms of molecules, the vast majority of them are not like that. My view is that in every species, there is an enormous amount of molecular change. Eventually, some changes become phenotypically important; if the environment changes, some of the neutral molecules may be selected and this of course follows the Darwinian scheme.” Thus, Kimura's statement exemplifies the central principle that the various levels of evolution's hierarchy work in characteristically different ways — and that levels can interact fruitfully in these disparate modes.

The chronological reaction of Darwinian hardliners to the neutral theory can be epitomized in a famous, if sardonic, observation about the fate of controversial theories. Tradition attributes this rueful observation to T. H. Huxley, but some form of the statement may well date to antiquity, the usual situation for such “universal” maxims. In any case, the earliest reference I know comes from the great embryologist von Baer, who attributed the line to Agassiz (von Baer, 1866, p. 63, my translation): “Agassiz says that when a new doctrine is presented, it must go through three stages. First, people say that it isn't true, then that it is against religion, and, in the third stage, that it has long been known.”

The first two stages unfolded in their conventional manner, with quizzical denial followed by principled refutation in theory (see p. 521 on Mayr's argu­ment that neutralism cannot be true because we now know the ubiquity of se­lection). However, the third stage — still stubbornly occupied by some strict Darwinians — arose with an interesting twist, providing a cardinal illustration for this section's major theme: the dangers of parochialism, particularly the tendency to interpret all evolution from an organismal vantage point. Instead of simply stating that neutralism has long been known (so what's the big deal?), detractors now tend to say: “well, yes, it's true, and let's be generous and give Kimura and company due credit. But, after all, neutral substitutions only occur at sites without consequence for organismic phenotypes. So why focus upon such changes? Without any organismal effect, they can't be im­portant in evolution. And no one can blame Darwin or Darwinian tradition for ignoring an invisible phenomenon.”

This exculpation of Darwin cannot be faulted in logic, but the rest of the argument reflects a narrow and discouraging attitude. Isn't the claim of unimportance absurd prima facie? How can anyone advance an argument for downgrading, as marginal, a process potentially responsible for more than half of all nucleotide substitutions — the supposed basis of evolution within a scientific ethos centered on reductionist preferences? Only a lingering preju­dice for viewing organisms as a unique and intrinsic focal level could possibly generate such a claim.

Yes, an organism might view the world of its own compatriots as stable islands rising above an invisible sea — and choose to disregard random change within this swirling ocean of underlying, constant activity. But (if I may pur­sue this strained metaphor for a moment), any dynamic particle in the ocean could just as well, and perhaps with more merit, view the islands as rare and insignificant pedestals intruding into the truly fundamental substrate. May I just note the sterility of such a subjective argument, and state that any process with so strong an impact on change at any level cannot be unimportant in a world judged by relative frequencies.

As an illustration of the importance (and separability) of hierarchical lev­els, we may invoke balances produced by negative interaction among levels as a measure for the indispensability of molecular neutrality in full explanations of evolutionary phenomena. Just as a stable balance may arise by opposite forces of selection at adjacent levels, different processes — in this case neutral­ity at one level vs. selection at another — can also produce an intermediary re­sult testifying to the importance of both styles of change. In such cases, more­over, neutrality enjoys a special heuristic advantage because random models yield general, quantitative predictions, while selectionist explanations usually require knowledge of particular circumstances that are much harder to deci­pher, and often impossible to quantify (for lack of requisite historical infor­mation).

For example, Spalax ehrenbergi, a blind Near Eastern mole rat, develops a rudimentary eye with an irregular lens that cannot focus an image. The eye is covered by thick skin and hair, and the animal shows no neurological re­sponse to powerful flashes of light (see p. 1282 for fuller discussion of this case in a different context). As expected under the neutral theory, the major lens protein, aA-crystallin, evolves much faster in S. ehrenbergi than in other murine rodents with normal vision (Hendricks et al., 1987) — nine amino acid replacements in a sequence of 173, over 40 million years of evolutionary sep­aration, whereas the other nine rodents of this study show identical amino acid sequences, with no alterations at all from the ancestral state. But this rate of change for Spalax represents only 20 percent of the average for true pseudogenes, our best standard for a maximal and purely neutral pace of evolu­tion. At a rate of alteration too fast for stabilizing selection, but too slow for pure neutrality, the results imply a dynamic balance between molecular drift and weakened selective control at the organismic level. (Suggestions for con­tinued utility of a non-seeing lens include possible function in adjusting physi­ology to seasonal cues from changing day lengths, though we know no mech­anism for perceiving such fluctuations without vision, see Haim et al., 1983; and developmental constraint based on formation of eyes as a necessary inducer of some later and fully functional feature in embryology.)

I close this woefully insufficient commentary by reemphasizing the point that our discomfort or disinterest in random change largely reflects the pecu­liarity of the individual and level that we know best — organisms — and does not record any rarity or impotence for stochastic forces as agents of phyletic change in evolution. Processes of drift probably exert least influence upon the organismic level, for the two reasons cited earlier: large population sizes, and a style of individuality that forges coherence by strict functional coordination of subparts, and therefore makes nearly every trait of the organism subject to selection strong enough to overwhelm drift.

But the organism is a unique and peculiar kind of individual — and these strictures upon drift do not apply so strongly at any other level. We have seen, in this section, how structural features of DNA impose neutrality or near-neutrality upon selection at a large percentage of sites, perhaps a majority. For this reason (and not by limitation of population size), randomness be­comes a fundamental process of evolutionary change at the genic level, how­ever weak such a force may be (or, indeed, may not be!) at the organismic level. We shall see that, at the highest levels of species and clades, randomness again attains a high relative frequency — but this time mostly as a result of low N for species in clades. If such different causes grant randomness a high rela­tive frequency at several important levels of evolution's hierarchy — and if we can only assert low relative frequency at one level, and for reasons rooted in the peculiar character of individuality in this realm alone — then have we not committed a great conceptual error, and seriously narrowed our general view of evolution and the history of life, by giving short shrift to this most obvious of all alternatives to selection as a cause of change?



True genic selection. When future historians chronicle the interest­ing failure of exclusive gene selectionism (based largely on the confusion of bookkeeping with causality), and the growing acceptance of an opposite hierarchical model, I predict that they will identify a central irony in the embrace by gene selectionists of a special class of data, mistakenly read as crucial sup­port, but actually providing strong evidence of their central error. Gene selec­tionists have always welcomed genuine cases of a phenomenon that they then falsely generalize to all evolution — that is, differential proliferation of genes within genomes for reasons acting at the genic level, and independent of ef­fects introduced by downward causation from selection at any higher level.

Gene selectionists have naively embraced these examples as apparent confirmations of their belief that effectively all selection operates at this lowest level. If genes can work their magic even without a boost from the vehicles they usually employ as lumbering robots subject to their will, then our appre­ciation for their omnipotence can only increase. But such superficial admira­tion obscures a true distinction that actually illustrates the bankruptcy of exclusive gene selectionism. These examples do not showcase the maximal power of a ubiquitous phenomenon; rather, and quite to the contrary, they represent the only class of instances where pure and untrammeled gene selec­tion can operate at all!

As argued previously in this chapter (pp. 613–644), when gene selectionists speak of genes using organisms as their vehicles, they commit a deep error by inverting causality and ascribing to genes (which only record the causal re­sult, and therefore serve as good units of bookkeeping) the agency in natural selection that really belongs to the organism — for vehicles (or interactors) op­erate as units of selection, or causal agents of Darwinian evolution. But when genes do not use organisms as vehicles and engage in differential proliferation on their own accord, then the genes themselves do act as vehicles — and, con­sequently, can become units of selection. Gene selection only exists when genes can operate as vehicles (interactors); thus, these cases illustrate the re­stricted range of a process that gene selectionists naively regard as optimal il­lustrations of a ubiquitous phenomenon. The resulting irony deserves empha­sis. Supposed best cases become only cases, and therefore disproofs of a generality when properly interpreted. Wilson and Sober (1994, p. 592) put the point well: “These examples have been received with great fanfare by gene-centered theorists as some sort of confirmation of their theory. However, they do not confirm the thesis that genes are replicators — all genes are repli­cators by definition and no documentation is needed. These examples are re­markable because they show that genes can sometimes be vehicles. They seem bizarre and disorienting because they violate our deeply rooted notion that individuals are organisms.”

Devotees of the genic level may eventually accept the defeat of their theory of exclusivity with good grace — for the supplanting hierarchical model pro­vides more than enough room for true (and fascinating) examples of genuine genic selection, perhaps at quite high relative frequency once we acknowledge and learn to recognize the synergistic and orthogonal modes, as well as the better-documented examples of genic selection that harms organisms.

Moreover, when we recognize that many kinds and aggregations of genetic units can function in selection, the scope of this level becomes even wider. Selection may operate at the lowest unit of the nucleotide itself, if preferential substitution arises, for example, by differential production and consequently greater availability of one nucleotide vs. alternatives (the analog of natural selection by birth biasing). Selection among entire genes and other DNA seg­ments of comparable length may also hold great significance in evolution — as in Dover's important hypothesis of “molecular drive” (Dover, 1982).

In fact, we may be impeding a proper recognition of the substantial fre­quency of selection within genomes by naming the phenomenon for only one mode among many — “gene selection.” In the early days of Watson and Crick, biologists tended to conceptualize genomes as linear arrays of functional units (tightly strung beads with no spaces between in the usual metaphor). But we now know that most genes of eukaryotes, with their structure of exons separated by introns, do not maintain strict spatial continuity. More­over, the functional genes of most complex metazoans represent, in any case, just a few percent of the full genome. All other kinds of genomic elements, forming an overwhelming majority of sites, can also evolve by processes of drift and selection.

For this reason, Brosius and Gould (1992) suggested that we use a more general term — “nuon” for nucleic acid sequence (DNA or RNA) — to recog­nize any stretch of nucleic acid, functional or not in organismic terms, that can evolve by differential origin or replication:

Genomes do not consist only of genes. Sequences located between and also within gene boundaries, accounting for a large portion of the ge­nomes of higher Eucarya, are not being addressed in a similar manner, partly due to the widespread opinion that these sequences are without function . . . We propose to name all identifiable structures represented by a nucleic acid sequence (DNA or RNA) as “nuons.” A nuon can be a gene, intergenic region, exon, intron, promotor, enhancer, terminator, pseudogene, short or long interspersed element ... or any other retroelement, transposon, or telomer — in short, any unit from a few nucleotides to thousands of base pairs in length.



Proceeding upwards, aggregates of genes can also function as units of se­lection — including, as prominent agents in evolution, chromosomes (Nei, 1987), and organelles and bacterial plasmids within cells (Eberhard, 1980, 1990).

Organismic selection generally works with great effectiveness in suppress­ing “revolts” to organismic integrity by differential proliferation of elements from within (see Buss, 1987; Leigh, 1991). Most of the characteristic prop­erties of genomic organization and embryological development — from Ham­ilton's “gavotte of the chromosomes” in meiosis, to such phenomena as germ line sequestration and maternal determination in embryogenesis — may have evolved largely to suppress suborganismic selection, thereby assuring the in­tegrity of multicellular organisms. Meiosis itself presumably evolved to place one copy of each gene “in the same [gametic] boat,” thus converting organ­isms, rather than genes, into a primary unit of selection by the Musketeer's criterion of “all for one.” But, once achieved, meiosis must be actively guarded by organismal selection against destabilizing drivers and distorters — all to preserve what Leigh (1991, p. 258) calls “the genome's common inter­est in honest meiosis.”

Nonetheless, the evolutionary literature abounds with cases, both “classic” and new, of meiotic drivers, chromosomal segregation distorters, and other phenomena that favor the plurifaction of individual genes or sequences (in­cluding entire chromosomes) within the genome or population of genomes — usually with negative consequences for organismal selection above. Perhaps such cases must be relatively rare in nature, and only prominent in our litera­ture for their intriguing oddity and exceptional status in the light of organ­ismal selection's usual power to suppress such “outlaws.”

Driving genes and chromosomes use a variety of devices to increase their relative representation by suborganismal selection. Some, including the clas­sic t-allele of house mice (Lewontin, 1970), cause dysfunction in sperm car­rying the nondriving homologue; others, like the supernumerary chromosomes of rye, segregate preferentially into functional gametes. Werren (1991, p. 393) attributes the interest generated by these cases to implications for the hierarchical model of selection: “Driving chromosomes are of general interest in population genetics as examples of 'selfish' or 'parasitic' genetic elements. Such elements challenge the concept of the individual genome as a 'coopera­tive' unit because they gain a transmission advantage relative to the rest of an individual's genome but are often detrimental to individual organisms.”

Werren (1991; Werren, Nur, and Wu, 1988; Werren and Beukeboom, 1993) has also discovered and developed one of the most elaborate and inter­esting cases of suborganismal selection, a testimony to the complexity of in­teraction among levels of selection as well. In the parasitoid wasp Nasonia vitripennis, a supernumerary chromosome called PSR (paternal sex ratio) has evolved “an extreme and unusual form of transmission drive” (Werren, 1991, p. 392). This chromosome, carried in sperm, induces supercondensation of all male chromosomes (except itself) into a chromatin mass before the fertil­ized egg's first mitotic division. These chromosomes are then eliminated, while PSR survives. Since wasps are haplodiploid, this elimination converts an egg that would have become a diploid female into a haploid male (with PSR). This procedure obviously gives PSR a selective advantage in transmis­sion drive because males produced from fertilized eggs will always transmit this unpaired chromosome.

Just as obviously, organismic selection must oppose PSR, lest the en­tire population become both male and extinct. Werren (1991) had modeled conditions of maximal opposition from organismal selection. Subdivision of populations will be most effective in producing increased competition among PSR males, with reduced availability of females. But the story becomes even more complicated because suborganismal competition against PSR has also evolved by at least two devices that bias the sex ratio in a female direction (Werren and Beukeboom, 1993): (1) a maternally transmitted bacterium, called son-killer, that prevents the development of unfertilized (male) eggs; and (2) a cytoplasmically inherited agent of unknown structure and origin, that induces female wasps to produce nearly 100 percent daughters (called MSR, for maternal sex ratio). The possibilities introduced by haplodiploidy surely influence this variety and complexity in competing selection among suborganismic units — so stories this elaborate may not be common in nature. Still, as students of teratology in anatomy have always argued, we test and il­lustrate general rules by studying such cases at the limits.

But the main weight of gene selection in nature — the category that estab­lishes a high relative frequency for the phenomenon — probably resides in cases that are synergistic with, or orthogonal to, organismic selection, and therefore not opposed by this powerful, conventional mode. Any genetic ele­ment that can propagate itself within the genome, either by iteration in tan­dem or by duplication and transposition to other chromosomes, works thereby as a vehicle of its own relative increase — and therefore as an agent of positive Darwinian selection at the genic level. If this propagation encounters no resistance at some other level (particularly by the watchful organism) — either because bodies don't “notice” the increase (at least while the number of genic copies remains “within bounds”), or because higher-level selection also benefits from such differential genic proliferation (if, for a hypothetical exam­ple, an X-driving chromosome helped to generate the female bias that inter-demic selection also favored) — then genic selection can be quite rapid and powerful. This general phenomenon, perhaps of great importance in evolu­tion, has acquired the unfortunate name of “selfish DNA,” as designated in two seminal papers, representing independent and simultaneous discovery, and published back to back in Nature in 1980 (Orgel and Crick, 1980; Doolittle and Sapienza, 1980). These authors proposed that such genic selec­tion, orthogonal (at first) to organismal selection, might account for most of the middle-repetitive DNA — some 15 to 30 percent of the genome in humans and Drosophila, and usually existing as tens to a few hundred copies per se­quence, with copies often widely dispersed among several chromosomes.

Other hypotheses might explain this phenomenon, particularly as a poten­tial organismic need for enhanced levels of any products ultimately made by any gene. (In a purely organismal view, all genes may be able to proliferate, but not to fix their multiple copies unless organismic selection favors the in­crease. However, the two levels might also act synergistically, with genic drive evolving only in some genes, and for Darwinian benefit at this basal level, but with proliferation then enhanced by positive organismic selection upon bod­ies carrying more copies).

The “selfish DNA” hypothesis includes an attractive feature, rooted in the hierarchical theory of selection, for explaining stabilization of copy number at tens to hundreds, rather than an ultimately suicidal proliferation to inevita­ble death of the organism and all gene-individuals contained therein. Genie selection may begin in the orthogonal mode, as initial increases impose no consequences upon the phenotype. But organisms must eventually take no­tice, if only for the energetic drain, and presumed slowing of ontogenetic de­velopment, imposed by replication of so many unneeded copies with every cellular division. Original orthogonality must therefore eventually yield to a situation of genic selection contrary to organismal interest. At this point, neg­ative selection at the organismic level should stabilize and limit further in­crease — the presumed explanation, within the theory, for the intermediary copy number of middle-repetitive DNA.

Although I regard the hypothesis of “selfish DNA” as powerful, probably correct in many cases, and therefore as our best argument for substantially important selection at the genic level, two features in its initial promotion dis­tress me because they embody (without conscious intent, I assume) the persis­tent parochialism of organismic bias, even among those who explicitly pro­mote the hierarchical alternative. First, consider the unfortunate choices of names. Proliferating genic elements have generally been called “outlaws,” “renegades,” or “parasites”; and the general phenomenon entered our litera­ture as the hypothesis of “selfish DNA.” Orgel and Crick imposed a double whammy of opprobrium in the title of their original article: “Selfish DNA: the Ultimate Parasite.” The only reason that I can imagine for such derogatory terms resides in the unstated (and probably unconscious) notion that benefits for organisms define the ultimate goal and purpose of evolution as a general phenomenon. Thus, anything that can evolve, but either hurts the or­ganism actively, or even just manages to sneak past organismal scrutiny, must be designated as selfishness, nastiness, or even usurpation — as promoted by some reprobate object that would place its own propagation above the gen­eral good of evolution.

Surely, we must reject such parochial thinking and terminology. Propa­gating genic elements should not be described as parasites or renegades; nor can they be defined as “selfish” in any meaningful or general sense. Rather, propagating genes follow the Darwinian imperative at their own level, and therefore act as any good Darwinian agent “should” — that is, to increase their own representation within their own environment, the genome in this case. As Darwinians, we should honor their pluck in such a difficult endeavor (for organisms do tend to be watchful and suppressive), rather than heaping derogatory terms upon them. Such genes could only be deemed “selfish,” “parasitic,” etc., from a false and limited perspective that values the organism alone as an agent of evolutionary success. After all, we don't call a peacock selfish for evolving such a beautiful tail, and thus limiting the geological lon­gevity of the species.

To fully embrace the hierarchical model, a concept that marks a fundamen­tal shift in theory, not just an interesting new wrinkle upon an unaltered con­cept of nature's basic construction, we must reconceptualize all of evolution, and revise both our worldview, and our language, accordingly.

Second, even in terms of our conventional focus on organisms, genic selection may provide crucial and indispensable flexibility for evolution of any substantial organismic novelty, including features conventionally placed in our most vaunted category of “increasing complexity.” The general argument has become traditional in evolutionary theory (since the pioneering book of Ohno, 1970), and represents a solution to the following, otherwise dis­abling, paradox: Organismal selection on the earth's original prokaryotic biota might have constructed an optimal cell, “mean and lean” as could be, with a single copy of each gene to make, in the best possible way, one product indispensable for cellular success and propagation. But how could such an in­flexible organism ever change beyond minor adjustment to altered environ­mental circumstances? As Ohno wrote (1970): “from a bacterium only nu­merous forms of bacteria would have emerged.” But duplicated copies can provide requisite redundancy, permitting one copy to manufacture the needed product, while others become free to change — and to add new functions, thus providing a potential route to increasing complexity.

But if selection only works at the organismic level, and our “mean and lean” bacterial prototype has attained an optimal configuration, what pro­cess provides evolution with the multiple copies needed for flexible addition of functions? We gain nothing from noting that duplications provide later blessings, since evolution cannot operate for the benefit of unknown and unpredictable futures, unless our basic view of scientific causality needs funda­mental revision, and the future can determine the present.

Hierarchical selection provides the most promising exit from this substan­tial paradox: multiple copies cannot originate for future organismic benefit, but they can evolve by present genic selection! (Later exaptive utilization in the generation of organismal complexity illustrates the important historical principle that reasons for origin must be sharply separated from current util­ity — see Chapter 11 for extensive discussion. Evolution continually recycles, in different and creative ways, many structures built for radically different initial reasons.) In 1970, Ohno wrote with great prescience: “The creation of a new gene from a redundant copy of an old gene is the most important role that gene duplication played in evolution.”

Thus, if duplication requires genic selection in many or most cases, then the first level of evolution's hierarchy not only operates with respectable relative frequency, but even provides an indispensable boost for generating the sum-mum bonum of our deepest prejudices — the complex organism, with even­tual evolution of a single strange mammalian species endowed with a unique capacity for self-reflection, but occupying an isthmus of a middle state, a good vantage point for looking down with thanks to duplicating genes, and up with awe to a tree of life that could generate such an interesting and acci­dental little twig.





THE CELL-INDIVIDUAL I speak here not of free-living unicells (where cell and organism represent the same unit of evolutionary individuality), but of cells that generally house full genomes and form the environment of genes at the level below, while also serving as parts and building blocks of multi-cellular organisms at the level above. From our limited viewpoint as highly complex metazoans built by intricate and integrated programs of embryo-logical development, we tend to neglect this intermediary level of differential cellular proliferation (not just to build bigger organs in the somatic environ­ment, for such a process yields no evolutionary reward in competition with other cells for representation in future generations, but rather to gain prefer­ential access to the germ line, and thus to achieve evolutionary success by positive selection at the cell level). We neglect this subject because positive se­lection now so rarely occurs at this level in complex metazoans — and for a reason continually emphasized in this chapter: the effectiveness of multi-cellular organisms in suppressing the differential propagation of subparts as a necessary strategy for maintaining functional integrity, the definitive property of individuality at the organismal level.

This suppression has been so effective, while the consequences of failure remain so devastating, that human organisms have coined a word for the cell lineage's major category of escape from this constraint, a name with power to terrify stable human organisms beyond any other threat to integrity and persistence — cancer. I suspect that we would learn much more about this large class of diseases (mistakenly viewed by most of the public as a single entity) if we treated the subject in evolutionary terms as a historical result of the cell's initial capacity, retained from its phylogenetic past as an entire organism, for differential proliferation over other cells (formerly competitors as separate organisms, not compatriots as components of other organs). Of course, mod­ern human cells that escape this constraint do themselves no ultimate good, for they have no access to the germ line, and their unrestrained growth even­tually eliminates both their own lineage and the entire surrounding organism. To this extent, the organism's general strategies do eventually prevail, follow­ing an initially successful assault by a cell lineage. But what a pyrrhic victory! Nonetheless, the double effectiveness of a virulent cancerous cell lineage — crowding out in place and distant metastasis to other locations in the body — recalls the more “benign” strategies of other successful evolutionary plurifiers within a constrained space (genie proliferation by tandem duplication and transposition; budding off of new demes and “capture” of existing demes by immigration and transformation).

If selection at the level of cell lineages now plays only a minor role in most groups of multicellular organisms, we should not view this hierarchical level as intrinsically impotent, but rather as historically suppressed in “the evolu­tion of [multicellular] individuality,” to cite the title of Leo Buss's seminal book on this intriguing subject (Buss, 1987). In Buss's terminology selection upon cells must now unfold in the “somatic environment,” where suppres­sion reigns in the service of organismic integrity, whereas such selection once occurred in the “external environment,” where unicellular organisms could experience the full independence and competitive range of Darwin's world. (In fact, since most organisms on earth remain unicellular — see Gould, 1996a, on the persistence of the bacterial mode throughout the history of life — this transition has never occurred for the vast majority of organisms on earth.)

This cellular level therefore provides our best demonstration that the cur­rent evolutionary hierarchy in styles of individuality arose both historically and contingently, and not with necessity as a timeless, predictable, invari­ant consequence of natural law. Levels have surely been added sequentially through time, as Buss has emphasized. If life began with naked replicators at the genic or subgenic level, then these earliest times for life may have featured, uniquely for this initial interval, the property that strict Darwinians have tried so hard to impose upon our richer world of modern life — selection at one level only. The evolution of cells led to a tripartite hierarchy that charac­terized most of life's 3.5 billion year history, and still regulates the majority of earthly organisms: genes, cells, and clones. The evolution of sexual reproduc­tion added species, while the complex processes that constructed the multi­cellular individual then added the organism (the body that encloses cells and cell lineages).

Suppression of cell lineage selection by the multicellular organism has greatly restricted a once vibrant and multifarious level. I must confess to my own parochialism in recognizing just one unit, the cell, as a surrogate for all entities that enclose genomes and form parts of organisms. Certainly organelles (or at least the mitochondria and chloroplasts that began their evolutionary history as symbiotic prokaryotes), and sometimes tissues and mod­ules of embryological development, can also act (in principle) as suborganismal units of selection. I make the amalgamation because this level has been largely suppressed, and therefore doesn't often come to our attention in stud­ies of modern multicellular organisms. In so doing, I feel some allegiance to the folk taxonomist who (as so often recorded for indigenous cultures) assid­uously names each species (much as a trained Linnaean systematist would do) for creatures important to his life, but then lumps into large categories (weeds, butterflies, bugs) the organisms of no great moment in his world.

As the central premise of his fascinating and seminal book, Buss (1987) argues that the multicellular individual arose by “the interplay between selec­tion at the level of the individual and selection at the level of the cell lineage” (p. 29). More specifically, he attributes the distinctive features of metazoan development to an initial competition among cell lineages, eventually tamed and regulated by organismic selection in the interests of bodily integrity. Buss writes: “The thesis developed here is that the complex interdependent pro­cesses which we refer to as development are reflections of ancient interactions between cell lineages in their quest for increased replication. Those variants which had a synergistic effect and those variants which acted to limit subse­quent conflicts are seen today as patterns in metazoan cleavage, gastrulation, mosaicism, and epigenesis” (p. 29).

Clearly, such a concept becomes intelligible only under the aegis of a hierarchical model of selection, as defended in this book's central thesis. Buss recognizes this conceptual link, of course, and his work becomes a strong confirmation of both the efficacy and necessity of this basic reconstruction in evolutionary theory. In terms similar to the views expressed here, Buss writes (pp. 5-6): “The logical structure of Darwin's argument allows any unit to evolve if it replicates with high fidelity, and if selection distinguishes be­tween the variants. Species, populations, and lineages of individuals, cells, organelles, and gene sequences can all potentially evolve. Yet we have been largely content to attribute the whole of biological diversity to selection upon individuals [organisms]. The once comfortable cloak of the Modern Synthesis has become restrictive.” (I am also grateful to Buss for recognizing the role of my profession, particularly in the work of Eldredge, Jablonski, Stanley, Vrba, and myself, in developing the hierarchical theory of selection. He writes (p. ix): “Indeed, hierarchical perspectives on evolution are undergoing a re­birth among paleontologists at the moment.”)

In Buss's model of historical and sequential construction for nature's hierarchy, new levels arise to enclose the individuals of older levels by a two-step process. The initial features of the nascent level must originate in synergism, or positive interaction, with selection at the level just below, which formerly stood topmost, but will now be superseded (in the literal sense of “sat upon”) by the newly emerging style of organization. New levels must begin with such a helpful boost, for the initial tentative and unformed steps cannot yet possess enough power to suppress or regulate a well-established level beneath. But stabilization of the new level, implying a power to suppress at least some forms of harmful proliferation from within, then requires negative interac­tion, once the new and higher level achieves enough coherence to act in its own right.

Since we have no direct data for key transitions that occurred so long ago and left no fossil evidence (so far as we know), Buss constructs some hypo­thetical examples of how such a process could work. (Such entirely specula­tive scenarios must be understood within their acknowledged limits — that is, as hypothetical stories, “cartoons” in Buss's words, invented to illuminate a potential mode, and not as claims about any historical actuality.) For exam­ple, if the first tentative multicellular organisms evolved as little more than spherical colonies of identical protists floating in the ocean, how might essen­tial organismic properties like cellular differentiation emerge? Suppose that a variant cell lineage arose in such a loosely knit, hollow sphere of cells, caus­ing members of the new line to enter the sphere's center, where proliferation could continue. In this way, a new cell lineage (and the beginning of cellular differentiation for the organism) could originate and proliferate by selection at the cell level. Buss then supposes that such an event might also be beneficial for the organism, and he draws an analogy to the ontogeny of some modern sponges:

The origin of a variant cell line which entered the center of such a sphere to continue cell division . . . may have produced a structure which was sufficiently negatively buoyant to fall to the sea floor. Many modern sponges ... do just this. A flagellated sphere populated by amoeboid cells simply drops to the ocean bottom . . . The pelago-benthic life cycle of sponges may have arisen as a consequence of variants which, in pursu­ing their own replication, fortuitously presented the individual with a benthic existence and all the attendant opportunities inherent in the in­vasion of a new adaptive zone.



This move toward a more complex and better-integrated organism begins with an initial synergism between cellular and organismic selection (origin of a new cell lineage by invasion and proliferation in the organism's hollow cen­ter, leading to organismal advantages through an imposed change of habitat). But later stabilization of this innovation requires the suppression of cell lin­eage selection by the organismic level — for if the two cell lineages (at the sphere's periphery and center) engage in an anarchic battle for ever greater representation in cellular percentages, either the organism will lose coherence and die, or one lineage will win and the organism will return to its previous state of minimal differentiation.

Moving away from speculation and towards an explanation of metazoan development, Buss interprets several defining features of many (but not all) metazoan phyla as records of successful suppression of cell-lineage selection by organismal selection from above. In particular, he views early germ-line sequestration (Weismann's crucial criterion in his defense of Darwin against resurgent late 19th century Lamarckism, see Chapter 3), and maternal predestination, as organismal devices evolved to set and stabilize the course of development as early in ontogeny as possible, thus greatly reducing the po­tential for new forms of differential cellular proliferation either to arise at all in later ontogeny, or to reach the germ line and act in cell-lineage selection even if they do manage to originate. Buss sums up his thesis:

Selection at the level of the individual has opposed selection at the level of the cell lineage by acting to set the timing of terminal somatic differentiation as far back in ontogeny as possible — whenever possible into the maternal cytoplasm itself, (p. 5). ... The release of the totipotent germinative lineage from the task of producing somatic tissues meant that the number of divisions made by the totipotent lineage could be re­duced and, consequently, the opportunity for variants to arise to become severely restricted (p. 100) . . . Metazoans, by the twin devices of mater­nal predestination and germ-line sequestration, have effectively closed their ontogenies to heritable intrusion arising in the course of that ontog­eny. A novel epigenetic program can only arise if a mutation of extraor­dinarily improbable precision and autonomy occurs in the germ cells themselves (p. 102).



But nothing can be won without a price in our complex world of interact­ing levels, either in evolution or in human society. In stabilizing the organismic level with such effective devices to suppress cellular and other forms of suborganismic selection, organisms have greatly reduced their flexibility for future evolutionary change of more than a superficial nature. For these mech­anisms of development do not suppress only the forms of cell-lineage selec­tion that would harm the organism; rather, they impede any effective cellular selection at all, whether beneficial or harmful. These policing devices of the organism therefore close off an avenue once open for substantial change in basic designs, thus restricting maximal potency to the iteration of essentially similar species (as in such famous examples as the cichlids of African lakes, or the Galapagos finches), now representing evolution in its most vigorous con­temporary mode. Ou sont les neiges d'antan? “The clear implication is that evolution of cellular differentiation fueled the evolution of controls over vari­ants which fail to behave altruistically. The mechanisms, which metazoans employ to limit the heritability of variants, which fail to contribute to somatic functions, are blind to the traits, which a variant might express. Potentially beneficial variants are as limited as are potentially detrimental ones” (p. 103, Buss's italics).

This perspective implies a striking limitation upon the strictly Darwinian style of extrapolative and gradualistic selection that the Modern Synthesis promulgated as an adequate explanation for evolution at all scales of time and effect (see quotation from Wilson et al. on p. 583). If Buss's views are valid, then conventional Neo-Darwinian evolution must work within stric­tures of essentially established ontogenies that can surely generate exuberant adaptive variations upon set themes, but may be effectively unable to con­struct major innovations that establish the outlines of macroevolution. Once again, we grasp the need for independent macroevolutionary theory — and Buss has supplied an important piece of the general argument with his con­cept of a correlation between such major innovations and the origin of new hierarchical levels, a theme that obviously requires the hierarchical model and cannot be encompassed within the strict Darwinism of the Modern Syn­thesis. Buss concludes (p. 188, his italics): “Synergisms between the units drove the elaboration of a higher unit and conflicts arising between units were minimized by adaptations limiting further variation. This conclusion has the fascinating and crucial corollary that the major features of evolution were shaped during periods of transition between units of selection.”





THE ORGANISM-INDIVIDUAL As virtually the entire history of Darwinian thought has unfolded under the assumption that organisms act as nearly ex­clusive agents of selection (or at least that our interest in evolution centers upon the alterations and fates of organisms), I shall not dwell upon this ca­nonical individual here. I want only to reemphasize the unique and decidedly peculiar features of our kind of entity (in contrast to the characteristic prop­erties of individuals at other levels): maximal cohesion based on functional integration, including relatively inflexible spatial orientations of subparts (spatiotemporal if we include embryogenesis). This style of integrity enables the organism to be particularly effective in suppressing selection against its interests by potential evolutionary individuals dwelling within and forming its parts. As noted above, the virtual “extinction” of effective cell lineage se­lection in complex metazoan phyla occurred as a historical result of the evo­lutionary “invention” of the intricate organism — perhaps the only example of an “endangered level” in the entire history of evolution!

As another portentous implication of individuality in this mode, organisms become chock full of adaptations as a consequence, under natural selection, of building coherence by functional integration. This local phenomenon at one level of Darwinian individuality has generated an understandable and commanding concern with adaptation, leading to doctrines of exclusivism in extreme cases (all too common, given our psychological preferences for simple and unifying worldviews — a need traditionally met theologically, but sometimes, particularly in our increasingly secular age, scientistically). If, as some strict Darwinians believe, “organized adaptive complexity” repre­sents both the primary result of evolution and the cause of all other patterns in the history of life, then we will fail to understand nature for two cardinal reasons: (1) because we have adopted a criterion too strict even for its organismal level of most promising application (see Chapters 10 and 11); and (2) because the criterion of “organized adaptive complexity” does not strongly characterize the nature or definition of individuality at most other levels of the hierarchy.

Nature's hierarchy is not fractal; each level, to express the point metaphorically, does some things well, and other things poorly or not at all — and the evolutionary pattern of nature features many essential things. In our mother's house — the Earth — are many mansions. Gene selection is “good” at iterating elements — an important input of raw material for generating “organized adaptive complexity” at a higher level. Organisms are good at building com­plex adaptations. Species are good at forging temporal trends of geological duration, and their efforts largely regulate the relative diversity among phyla (why so many beetles, and so few pogonophorans). To say (as Dawkins, Wil­liams, and other detractors often do) that species selection must be unimpor­tant because such a process can't build organismal complexity reminds me of the cook who didn't like opera because singing couldn't boil water.





THE DEME-INDIVIDUAL This kind of individual has borne the brunt of the general argument about higher-level selection ever since Darwin awarded the idea a strictly limited amount of conceptual space in trying to puzzle out the origins of human altruism (see pp. 133-137). The subject has been ex­tensively reviewed and controverted (Wynne-Edwards, 1962, vs. Williams, 1966, for an early and generally unacceptable version; Wade, 1978, 1985; D. S. Wilson, 1980, 1983,1989; Wilson and Sober, 1994; Sober and Wilson, 1998, for reviews). I shall therefore provide only an idiosyncratic sketch here, for the terms and concepts of this discussion permeate the chapter, while my own interest as a paleontologist flows to the still higher levels that have not been extensively studied.

In a curious way, the development and acceptance of hierarchy theory has been impeded because the classical treatment of this subject has been focussed so strongly, indeed almost exclusively, on this level — and demes are the hard­est of all individuals to validate and justify within the evolutionary hierarchy. All other individuals build better boundaries (to retain their own subparts, or lower-level individuals, and to exclude the subparts of other individuals at their level), and experience less difficulty in remaining sufficiently stable for the requisite time until reproduction. But demes are especially vulnerable to the classic objection (see p. 647) that, lacking strong internal mechanisms for coherence, their individuality may be too fleeting and subject to change by loss or invasion — as in Dawkins's well-formulated and memorable image of dust storms in the desert or clouds in the sky. Indeed, as I argued previously (p. 648), the classic defense of interdemic selection depends upon the identi­fication of plausible conditions that would allow such adventitious groups to remain stable long enough to act as units of selection. The centering of the general argument for higher-level selection upon demes has, by false and un­fortunate implication, led to the widespread impression that any kind of supraorganismal selection must face the same difficulties — perhaps with problems growing ever more intense as individuals become more inclusive. But this argument, based on illogical assumptions about linear extrapolation, does not hold because demes (in most circumstances) are uniquely unstable in the evolutionary hierarchy. Species, for example, usually attain as much sta­bility and coherence as organisms, though by different mechanisms (see pp. 703–705).

Group selection has traditionally been invoked under our organismic bi­ases as an explanation for bodily behaviors — with altruism as a paradigm, ever since Darwin himself (see Chapter 2, pp. 133–136) — that seem, prima facie, difficult to explain as beneficial to organisms, but can easily be con­strued as valuable for groups. But we should recognize such restricted invoca­tion (only for cases that trouble organismic traditionalists) as yet another pa­rochial limitation, and we should acknowledge a potentially general role for interdemic selection within any species of appropriate population structure. (Under such a criterion of judgment by relative frequency, we must ask a dif­ferent, and quite unanswered, fundamental question: how many higher taxa generally maintain population structures that promote interdemic selection; in what environments; and with what correlations to such factors as phylogenetic status, body size, behavioral complexity, etc.)

If various arguments for the rarity of extensive evolution within large panmictic populations hold merit, and if Sewall Wright's shifting balance the­ory applies to a high percentage of populations, then interdemic selection may become a major mechanism for evolution within species through time. However, if punctuated equilibrium generally holds (see Chapter 9 for a de­fense of this view), then anagenesis within species will be rare in any case (whether by transformation via organismic selection under panmixia, or by shifting balance via interdemic selection in appropriately subdivided popula­tions). Or perhaps, as an intermediate position, panmictic transformation is rare, but shifting balance frequent, in species that meet the criteria for appro­priate population structure. The high relative frequency of punctuated equi­librium would then measure the relative rarity of such population structures, and the few groups that show extensive gradualism within species may gener­ally subdivide their populations according to Wrightian criteria. This conjec­ture has not been tested, but could be, and with an interesting mixture of paleontological data on the history of species and neontological information on population structures within modern representatives of the same groups.

In any case, even if Wright's criteria don't hold often enough within the central range of species during the heart of their geological life, Mayr's peripatric model of speciation suggests that the origin of most species may occur by a process close to interdemic selection, and operating near a blurred bor­derline with species selection. If many species spawn large numbers of periph­erally isolated demes, but only a few of these demes become species; and if the small class of successful speciators possess traits at the population level that encourage full speciation in interaction with the environment; then species will arise by selection and differential preservation on a just a few “winners” within a set of populations that begin as demes of an ancestral species (as best illustrated by the probable main reason for failure of others to speciate — reincorporation of a peripherally isolated deme into the larger parental popu­lation).

For all these reasons, I suspect that selection among deme-individuals holds an importance as yet unrealized (and perhaps occurring in modes as yet unconceptualized) within our general picture of evolution. I have, in my ca­reer, witnessed three examples of widespread dismissal by ridicule as part of a professional ethos: the rejection of continental drift as physically inconceivable; the shunning of Goldschmidt's macroevolutionary ideas as dangerous to the Darwinian consensus; and the dismissal of group selection as addlepated nonsense (see pp. 553–556). Nothing in my intellectual life has made me feel more uncomfortable.

I take great pleasure in the comeuppance of the smug ridiculers in all three cases. Plate tectonics have validated continental drift to become a new para­digm for geology. Goldschmidt's particular genetics win no general plaudits, but his views on a conceptual break between micro- and macroevolution now enjoy substantial support. The vindication of group selection has been slower, but now moves on apace (see Sober and Wilson, 1998) — with a vigor­ous professional discussion finally occurring, and with general attention now accorded, both in the popular press (Lewin, 1996), and in the commen­tary sections of general professional journals (Morrell, 1996). Sic semper tyrannis.





THE SPECIES-INDIVIDUAL I propose, as the central proposition of macroevolution, that species play the same role of fundamental individual that organisms assume in microevolution. Species represent the basic units in theo­ries and mechanisms of macroevolutionary change. In this formulation, the origins and extinctions of species become strictly analogous to the births and deaths of organisms — and just as natural selection works through differential proliferation based on schedules of organismal births and deaths, so too does species selection operate upon the frequencies and timetables of origins and extinctions. The next section of this chapter — entitled “the grand analogy” — shall complete this argument by attempting to cash out this comparison in de­tail, with all the intriguing differences that arise when disparate individuals at two such different levels work by the same abstract mechanism.

I will therefore confine this preliminary discussion to the three major objections that have been raised against the foundational idea that species can act as important evolutionary individuals. These objections treat, in reverse or­der, the three words in the key phrase, “important evolutionary individuals.” The first objection holds that species cannot be construed as proper individu­als; the second admits that species are individuals, but argues that they can­not operate as interactors (as required for units of selection); while the third allows that species may be recognized as both individuals and interactors, but insists that they must remain effectively impotent in both roles.

Species as individuals. The classic argument of evolutionary gradu­alism denies real existence to species because they can only be defined as arbitrarily delineated segments of a lineage in continual anagenesis. Both Lamarck and Darwin, despite their maximally different views about pro­posed evolutionary mechanisms, strongly supported the nominalistic claim that only organisms exist as natural units, and that species must therefore represent abstractions, formally designated only for human convenience. (As many historians have remarked, Darwin chose an odd title for his revolution­ary book — for he focusses upon the explanation of substantial change by anagenesis, and says little about speciation by branching of lineages.)

I presented the case for treating species as individuals in an earlier sec­tion of this chapter (pp. 603–608), noting that punctuated equilibrium greatly aids such a delineation, but then extending and generalizing the argu­ment by holding that species can be individuated under any scheme that de­picts their origin as an event of branching, rather than anagenetic transforma­tion. Critics of this view, particularly Williams (who does not dispute the truly necessary claim for origin by branching), continue to raise standard ob­jections, especially “an absence of a decisive beginning for a species” (Wil­liams, 1992, p. 121). But Williams, in advancing this argument, commits the classic error of failure to appreciate proper scales. His claim for fatal fuzziness in origins views the question from a generational perspective at the scale of human lifetimes. The great majority of species, however, arise in geological moments (thousands of years, and thus overly long only at the inappropriate scale of our personal lives) — a shorter period of ambiguity (relative to later duration as a clearly separate entity) than we note for most asexual organ­isms that reproduce by budding (the proper organismic analog for the origin of a new species by branching)!

Most other published objections to species as individuals also express little beyond our psychological difficulty in making a transition to different crite­ria at unfamiliar scales. Some critics have argued, for example, that species can't develop the requisite property of heritability, because no mechanism can be analogized with the well-known Mendelian basis for this phenomenon at the organismic level. But heritability measures the correlation between par­ents and offspring based on direct transmission of formative properties — and daughter species surely inherit parental characteristics by this standard route. The required correlation arises by transmission of autapomorphic characters through retained homology — the appropriate mechanism of heritability at this higher scale, and in no way “worse” than Mendelian criteria for the con­struction of organisms. Moreover, species heritability can be measured in the same general way, and with the same potential accuracy, as standard organis­mic heritability — as Jablonski (1987) has done in our best-recorded case of species selection for the evolution of marine mollusks in normal times and ep­isodes of mass extinction.

Other critics charge that species are too spatially diffuse, or too lacking in mechanisms of internal coherence, to count as individuals. But, again, these arguments only arise from failure to conceptualize this different scale in an appropriate manner — a mental foible rooted in our parochial allegiance to the particular (and poorly-scaling) criteria of individuality for organisms. Species don't build a physical skin, but reproductive isolating mechanisms maintain their borders just as sharply. Species don't evolve immune systems and other forms of “policing” against outside invaders, but the constant ad­mixture among their parts via sexual reproduction maintains coherence with more than adequate force.

Species as interactors. This more interesting and challenging argu­ment has unfolded among supporters of macroevolutionary theory as an “in-house” debate. Most discussants, including Brandon, Gould, Jablonski, Lloyd, Stanley, and Vrba, strongly support the concept of species as units of selection; while Damuth and Eldredge grant species a role as replicators, but not as interactors, and therefore not as agents of selection. Grantham (1995) has tried to mediate these positions with a compromise that will, I suspect, satisfy neither side.

Critics allow that species may be “fundamental units” of macroevolution in some sense — but they say, only as the replicators that serve as “atoms” of cladistic phylogeny, and not as interacting units that forge macroevolutionary change by active competition in natural environments. (Eldredge, for exam­ple, includes species in the genealogical column of his two-hierarchy scheme — see page 642 for a critique — but not in his economic column of inter­actors.) A species, the critics continue, may live in too broad a range of envi­ronments, and over too wide a geographic range — often discontinuous to boot — to serve as an interactor, or unit of selection. Moreover, although indi­vidual populations of two species may compete sympatrically over a well-de­lineated geographic range, entire species rarely maintain sufficient overlap to interact with each other as complete units.

To resolve this apparent dilemma, Damuth (1985) proposes that we define a new interactor corresponding most closely to the hierarchical level where species serve as replicators. Using a criterion of direct competition in sympatry, Damuth proposes the term “avatar” for such interactors, defined as sympatric populations in ecological competition, and therefore interpretable as alternatives subject to selection. Grantham's (1995) “compromise” posi­tion maintains allegiance to Damuth's insistence upon potential interaction in sympatry. Grantham defends species selection, and regards species as poten­tial interactors — but he would restrict any particular study of species selec­tion to members of clades living in the same broad region. He writes (1995, p. 311): “I suggest that paleontologists focus on geographically constrained portions of monophyletic clades.”

I would raise three arguments against this proliferation of terms and categories — and for the status of species as adequate interactors.

1. A standard mode of construing competition among organisms has be­guiled us into thinking that interaction requires sympatry. As argued in Chap­ter 6 (pp. 470–477), Darwin strongly asserted the predominance of biotic over abiotic competition as the only promising path for a defense of progress in evolution. This preference has passed through the Victorian fascination with overt battle as a defining mode of competition, right into our present times, with continuing Tennysonian metaphors about “nature red in tooth and claw” (see Gould, 1992a), and newspaper stories about firms engaged in Darwinian struggles to the death as they vie directly for the allegiance of a limited population of consumers. (As I revised this chapter in the summer of 2000, a new magazine for “business evolving in the information age” made its debut under the name Darwin — also available on line at www.darwin-mag.com.)

But this focus on the biotic mode has always been indefensible as a claim for exclusivity, or even dominant relative frequency. In Darwin's own time, Huxley ridiculed this notion as “the gladiatorial theory of existence,” while Kropotkin (1902) and others constructed alternatives based on cooperation in sympatry and the prevalence of abiotic competition in most environments (see Todes, 1988; Gould, 1991b). Darwin himself clearly favored an expan­sive concept of interaction with environments in natural selection — as when he insisted, in a famous passage (1859, p. 62), that “a plant on the edge of a desert” struggles for existence against the drought and other features of the physical environment just as surely as “two canine animals in a time of dearth” struggle more overtly for a limited supply of meat.

This point becomes important when we try to translate this debate about organisms to a definition of higher-level interactors. Biotic competition does require sympatry for direct and literal struggle, while abiotic competition im­poses no such conditions, and must often occur among organisms that never encounter each other, even while living in sympatry. If we use biotic competi­tion as our (often unconscious) paradigm for the entire, and far broader, con­cept of interaction, then we too easily become unduly committed to the false restriction that interactors must be able to duke it out directly. In upward translation, this bias leads to the idea that species-individuals can't be inter­actors unless they live in the same place, and thus maintain a potential for en­gaging in some analog of overt battle.

But interaction at the canonical level of organisms doesn't demand direct contact, or even life in the same place — and no one has denied that organisms operate as quintessential interactors, and units of selection. If abiotic compe­tition dominates the history of life — as many distinguished researchers insist (see references in Allmon and Ross, 1990), at least for many groups in many circumstances — then potential for direct contact cannot be invoked as a pri­mary criterion for defining interactors.

Williams (1992) has strongly asserted the non-necessity of sympatry (and resulting potential for direct “struggle”) in defining higher-level interactors — and he uses the same analogy here advanced for asserting a similar non-neces­sity at the organismal level. I presented the full quote before, but repeat the operative line here (1992, p. 25): “One issue is whether the populations that bear the gene pools need be in ecological competition with each other. I believe that this is not required, any more than individuals within a popula­tion need interact ecologically to be subject to individual selection.” Later, Williams specifically criticizes Damuth's definition of avatars on this basis. Speaking of populations not in direct competition, but subject to similar stresses (a common predator in their separate environments in this hypotheti­cal case), Williams writes (1992, p. 52): “I am inclined to recognize that clade selection is operating even here, unlike Damuth, who maintains that only sympatric avatars, populations in ecological competition, can be alternatives subject to selection. Allopatric forms may not be ecological competitors, for the inattention of a predator or anything else, but they compete for represen­tation in the biota, the ultimate prize in clade selection.”





2. Although I recognize that some notion of a common environment must be invoked when we wish to define allopatric species as competing inter-actors, I do not view such a requirement as either rarely met or particularly difficult to specify. (I only mean, by the last phrase, “any more difficult to specify than for sympatric interactors.” We cannot know, in fully adequate detail, how individuals at any level react to all nuances of the environment, in all their horrendously complex and nonlinear interactions. Who can say whether two sympatric organisms, given their inevitable differences, perceive the same local change of environment — even such a linear effect as a falling temperature — in the same way? I am only arguing that we face the same dif­ficulty for sympatric, as for allopatric, interactors in this respect.)

At least two strong arguments support the notion of adequate environmen­tal similarity in allopatry:

(i) Environments cannot be conceptualized (or even operationalized) as objective places or circumstances in a world fully external to the organisms involved. First of all, environments include all interactions with other organ­isms, both conspecific and belonging to different taxa, and not just the climates, substrates, and other more measurable properties of a surrounding physical world. Second, and more important, as Lewontin has emphasized so forcefully (1978, 2000), environments are intrinsically referential, and ac­tively constructed by the organisms in question. Environments, in short, are made, not found. Thus, important properties of the environment must be suf­ficiently comparable in a set of closely related and partly allopatric species en­gaged in a process of species selection. These species share key traits as autapomorphies of their clade — and since these traits help to construct the relevant environment, sufficient similarity becomes, in part, an active con­struction of related organisms, not only a happenstance of common exter­nalities.

(ii) Organisms needn't occupy the same turf in order to be impacted in sim­ilar ways by the kinds of broad environmental changes that seem so impor­tant at geological scales. To choose an extreme example, when, 65 million years ago, a large bolide struck the earth in the region now occupied by the Yucatan peninsula, I suspect that Tyrannosaurus rex in the western United States, and its recently discovered sister taxon in Africa, experienced conse­quences sufficiently common and negative to influence their extinction (while some small-bodied mammals, living there and elsewhere, survived as a conse­quence of organismal or higher-level characters that also do not require sympatry with dinosaurs for meaningful comparison). Again, Williams (1992, p. 25) explains the issue succinctly and at more immediate scales: “Suppose a climatic change causes the brown trout of the upper Rhine to die out but lets the brown trout of the upper Danube survive. Suppose further that the differ­ence in fate is attributable to some difference in gene frequency that causes a difference in vulnerability to the change. That is surely clade selection. The ultimate prize for which all clades are in competition is representation in the biota.”

3. In many cases of species selection, the success of one species over another cannot be explained by competition between their sympatric popula­tions, but depends upon a species-level trait of the species's full range — in other words, species selection of the whole, not of avatars or sympatric sub­sections. I present in Figure 8-5 a hypothetical case developed by Robert N. Brandon (personal communication, 1988, Ohio State meeting).

The three species of a clade live on four adjacent volcanic islands. Species 2 can move readily across small oceanic gaps and inhabits all four islands. Spe­cies 1 and 3 have limited mobility and live on only one island each. (Species 2 gains no necessary advantage of the moment thereby.) The population of Spe­cies 1 on Island A, and of Species 3 on Island C, may each exceed the total number of organisms in Species 2 on all four islands. In fact, on any individ­ual island, either Species 1 or Species 3 may always fare better than Species 2. Each island maintains an active central volcano; when the volcano erupts, all life on the island dies, but the adjacent islands remain unaffected. One fine day, the volcanoes of Islands A and C erupt. As a consequence, Species 1 and





8-5. A hypothetical example of species selection based on traits that belong to entire species — in this case the full geographic range — and not to avatars or subpopulations thereof. See text for details of this verbal case developed by R. N. Brandon. Species 2 survives by virtue of its ability to spread among is­lands, even though any other species dominates over species 2 on any island of joint occurrence.





Species 3 become extinct, but Species 2 survives thanks to populations on Is­lands B and D — that is, only by virtue of populations allopatric with Species 1 and 3.

Clearly, Species 2 has survived as a result of greater geographic range, caused by whatever organismal, deme, or species traits permitted the coloni­zation of all islands. Geographic range may be either an emergent or aggre­gate trait of successful Species 2; but, in any case, this trait exists at the species level and confers an irreducible fitness based on superior range (obvi­ously a property of the species, and not of any individual organism, deme, or avatar). This hypothetical case presents a potential and plausible example of species selection based on a trait of the entire species and its complete range — and explicitly not on any sympatric avatar, or any other subsection of the full entity.

Species selection as potent. Two separate arguments, one empiri­cal and the other theoretical; have been raised against the efficacy of species selection. The first, which I regard as unfair, claims that a paucity of currently recorded empirical examples must indicate the rarity of the phenomenon. I would respond, first of all, that a few excellent (and elegant) cases have been well documented, so this process cannot rank as a distant plausibility wait­ing for an improbable verification, as some critics have charged. Jablonski (1987), for example, performed a pioneering study on species selection in Cretaceous mollusks during the long background interval preceding the mass extinction at the period's end. He found that species with planktotrophic lar­vae (defined as floating and feeding, and therefore remaining aloft for sub­stantial time) generally have larger geographic ranges and longer geological durations than species with nonplanktotrophic larvae (defined as either never planktonic, or floating without feeding, and therefore aloft for only a short period).

Jablonski supplies good inferential evidence for the two key claims that a hypothesis of species selection requires. First, he presents a strong case that geographic range not only correlates with longevity, but also helps to cause the extended duration. Species tend to reach their maximal range soon after their origin, and to maintain this breadth thereafter as a potent hedge against ex­tinction. Second, he calculated a strong heritability for geographic range by assessing the parent-offspring regression for this character. Geographic range surely constitutes a character of the species, not (obviously) of individual or­ganisms. This trait confers an emergent fitness on species that gain increasing longevity thereby. All necessary attributes for an interpretation based on spe­cies selection have therefore been identified.

(The case also includes interesting complexities. As mentioned previously for similar examples in Tertiary mollusks, nonplanktotrophic species gener­ally experience shorter longevity and maintain smaller populations in their more restricted ranges; but they also speciate more frequently, a presumed consequence of greater ease in forming isolated populations — for their evo­lution of larvae without extensive periods of flotation restricts gene flow among demes. Thus, the greater longevity of planktotrophic species need not imply increasing dominance of such species within the clade, for this positive trait can be counterbalanced by the higher speciation rates of shorter-lived nonplanktotrophic species. Moreover, Jablonski also showed that selective forces can change radically during episodes of mass extinction. In the great dying at the end of the Cretaceous period, geographic range of species shows no correlation with survivorship through the event. But, interestingly, geo­graphic range of entire molluscan clades (though not of their component spe­cies) does correlate positively with persistence through the mass extinction — a potential example of clade selection.)

I freely admit that well-documented cases of species selection do not permeate the literature. But I regard this infrequency as a great opportunity, rather than a restrictive limitation or an indication that the phenomenon scarcely exists. We have barely begun to acknowledge (much less to define or operationalize) this process, and we have still not entirely agreed upon crite­ria for recognition. We face the tradition of a full century spent not consider­ing causes at this level (indeed, actively denying the existence of such levels at all). We are just learning how to look — or, to state the issue more incisively; we have just begun to recognize that we should be looking at all! We face all the promise of a rich but unploughed field — and (to commit two literary bar­barisms of mixed metaphors and parodied quotations at the same time), we should summon up the courage of John Paul Jones and recognize that we have not yet begun to think.

I regard the second, or theoretical, objection as even more unfair in its purely traditionalist grounding in the parochialism of viewing organisms as exclusive agents of evolutionary interest or importance — more an aesthetic defense about comfort or preference than an intellectual argument about mechanisms. Several Darwinian strict constructionists, Richard Dawkins and Daniel Dennett in particular, hold that almost everything of interest in evolu­tionary biology either inheres in, or flows from, natural selection's power to craft the intricate and excellent design of organisms — “organized adaptive complexity,” in Dawkins's favorite phrase. “Biology is engineering,” Dennett tells us again and again in his narrowly focussed book (Dennett, 1995).

I do not deny either the wonder, or the powerful importance, of organized adaptive complexity. I recognize that we know no mechanism for the origin of such organismal features other than conventional natural selection at the organismic level — for the sheer intricacy and elaboration of good biomechanical design surely preclude either random production, or incidental ori­gin as a side consequence of active processes at other levels. But I decry the parochialism of basking so strongly in the wonder of organismic complexity that nothing else in evolution seems to matter. Yet many Darwinian adaptationists adopt this narrow and celebratory stance in holding, for example, that neutrality may reign at the nucleotide level, but still be “insignificant” for evolution because such changes impose no immediate effects upon organ­ismal phenotypes; or that species selection can regulate longstanding and ex­tensive trends in single characters, but still maintains no “importance” in evolution because such a process can't construct an intricate organismal phenotype of numerous, developmentally correlated traits.

Dawkins (1982, pp. 106-108), for example, damns species selection with faint praise in these terms:

I shall argue that a belief in the power of species selection to shape simple major trends is not the same as a belief in its power to put together com­plex adaptations such as eyes and brains ... The species selectionist may retreat and invoke ordinary low level natural selection to weed out ill-coadapted combinations of change, so that speciation events only serve up already tried and proved combinations to the sieve of species selec­tion. But this “species selectionist” ... has conceded that all the interest­ing evolutionary change results from inter-allele selection and not from interspecies selection, albeit it may be concentrated in brief bursts punc­tuating stasis ... The theory of species selection ... is a stimulating idea which may well explain some single dimensions of quantitative change in macroevolution. I would be very surprised if it could be used to ex­plain the sort of complex multidimensional adaptation that I find so in­teresting.



This statement commits the classic intentional fallacy of the prosecutor: attributing beliefs not held to adversaries, and then castigating them for apos­tasy (or praising them for good sense in recantation) — as illustrated by the paradigm for an opening thrust in a line of inquiry: “when did you stop beat­ing your wife?” Dawkins finds the adaptive complexity of organisms uniquely interesting. I also regard the subject as fascinating, and I would never attribute this quintessential property of organisms to selection at some other level. I fully acknowledge, as do all species selectionists, that the adap­tive complexity of organisms arises primarily by causal processes operating at the organismic level.

But this pluralistic principle applies equally well to other levels. If adaptive complexity marks “what organisms do,” and must therefore be explained at the organismic level — then “what species do” implies a consideration of cau­sation at the species level. Species “do” two primary things in macroevolu­tion: they carry trends within clades across long geological stretches of time, and they stand as basic units (geological “atoms” if you will) for counting the waxing and waning of differential diversity through time (why does our cur­rent biota feature 500,000 named species of beetles, but fewer than 50 of priapulids?). As a paleontologist, I regard these two phenomena as surpass­ingly important, while I remain happy to grant Dawkins's commanding inter­est in the adaptive complexity of organisms. But just as I try not to impose my causes (for other scales and levels) upon his material a priori, I ask him to ac­knowledge the importance of my favored themes within a comprehensive evolutionary theory (even if they do not engage his personal concern), and therefore to recognize the efficacy of different appropriate causes at this paleontological level. In short, Dawkins and others commit a classic psychological fallacy in denying status to species selection by confusing personal in­terest with general importance.

Only one line of defense remains open to those who still wish to deny the importance of species-level processes after correcting this psychological fal­lacy, and admitting that trends and changing patterns in diversity rank as vital subjects in a complete evolutionary theory, and also represent “what species do.” Such a Darwinian stalwart must argue that all (or nearly all) phe­nomena at the species level find their causes in upward translation from ordi­nary natural selection on organisms. Thus, if current biotas feature half a mil­lion species of beetles, this plethora can only imply that beetle organisms maintain a particularly favorable adaptive design. And if geological trends privilege increasing body size, larger brains, more complex ammonite su­tures, more symmetrical crinoid cups, fewer horse toes, and a thousand other documented patterns, these features must triumph by their adaptive value to organisms. I shall make no further arguments against such a narrow perspec­tive here (to save my rebuttal for Chapter 9, pp. 886–893), and will only quote a great American character, Sportin' Life in Porgy and Bess, to remind us that received wisdom does not always prevail:





The things that you're liable to read in the Bible

It ain't necessarily so.





THE CLADE-INDIVIDUAL Although a logical space must exist in our struc­ture of explanation for this highest level of the evolutionary hierarchy, I am not sure that clade selection plays a major role in evolution. Most clades con­tain so few parts (species) that their waxing and waning must often occur by processes that either operate as random inputs to the clade level, or result from selection among subparts (species selection, or lower-level selection), and therefore appear as drives at the clade level (and not as selection among entire clades treated as individuals). Secondly, while I have advocated a plu­rality of mechanisms for coherence of individuals at various levels in the hier­archy, I do have trouble in conceptualizing an adequate “glue” for clades, es­pecially since their parts (species) may live in such complete independence, and in such different ecologies, on distant continents. Finally, clades maintain the peculiar property (perhaps only an odd “allometric” consequence of nec­essary structure at this highest level, and not any compromise in efficacy) of necessarily originating as a single subpart — the founding species, and gaining definition (as a full level) only retrospectively, after adding new parts (more species) sequentially.

How then, given all these difficulties, could clades compete, qua clades as discrete and integral evolutionary items, even under the broad definition (see p. 706) that does not require direct contact or even life in sympatry? Is a clade, uniquely among evolutionary individuals of the hierarchy, more a “holding firm” for subparts than a coherent entity frequently subject to selec­tion at its own level?

One route to claiming a potential importance for clade selection remains open, but I am not confident that the argument can prevail (though Williams, 1992, despite his past as an ardent gene selectionist, has become a strong advocate of this view). What do we mean, for example, when we say that di­nosaurs died and mammals survived, or that brachiopods dwindled to a rem­nant while clams continually expanded? Do these descriptive statements im­ply clade selection? A general argument would have to be framed in the following way: any distinct clade maintains defining autapomorphic charac­ters expressed by all subparts (species). If a clade survives, while another living in roughly comparable habitats, dies — and if survival can be tied to autapomorphic characters held by the persisting clade (and absent in the ex­tinct clade) — may we not speak of clade selection based on a range of vari­ability that includes the key characters in the surviving case, but precludes their expression in the extinct clade?

For example, if mammals survived in part by virtue of small body sizes, and dinosaurs died for a set of consequences related to invariably (and sub­stantially) larger body size, couldn't we say that mammals, as a clade, pos­sessed genetic determinants (shared by homology in all subparts, with homology as the “glue” of cladal coherence) that all dinosaurs lacked as a result of their own evolved cladal distinctions? If such a scenario can count as clade se­lection (rather than just clade sorting, as an obviously valid description), then selection at this highest level becomes common in nature — for many clades yield in geological time to phylogenetically distant clades that share sufficient similarity in habitat and function to rank as genuine “replacements.”

I am not comfortable with this general argument, for no one has yet articulated firm and operational criteria for distinguishing true clade selection (based on irreducible fitness conferred by a clade-level property) from de­scriptive clade sorting (or differential survival as an effect of lower level prop­erties belonging to species or organisms, but translating upwards to success or failure of a clade as a geologically persistent entity). Some examples proba­bly do represent genuine clade selection — as in Jablonski's (1987) case of clade survival (through mass extinction), correlated with geographic range of the entire clade, but not with ranges of component species. Most other exam­ples, however, may not invoke any genuine clade-level character (either aggre­gate or emergent), but only represent the death of each species, item by item (part by part in cladal terms, for this highest-level individual also maintains the peculiar property of relative immunity, especially in clades with large numbers of widely distributed subparts, to the fate of individual subparts). We may frame our best descriptions for such cases in terms of clade sorting, but do they also qualify as cases of clade selection?

At a minimum, however, such arguments illustrate a need for macroevolutionary accounts at all levels, even when causality arises from lower levels and merely affects the fate of higher-level individuals. Thus, the explicit study of macroevolution would remain vital even if traditionalists had been correct in ascribing all causality to organismic selection. But we needn't take refuge in this “minimalist” defense. Causal processes — and not only selection, as I shall demonstrate in the next section — do operate at substantial (often controlling) relative frequency at all levels (with the possible exception of some dubiety about the importance of clade selection as expressed above, and some recognition that organismic selection has effectively squashed most cell-lin­eage selection in many phyla of multicellular organisms).

I therefore end this section with two statements from George Williams (1992), who once rejected higher-level selection with such verve and skill (1966), but who (while properly reasserting his excellent arguments against the old form of so-called “naive group selection,” or interdemic selection in the Wynne-Edwards modality) now strongly defends both the importance of selection at the species level (“clade selection” of lowest rank in his termi­nology, because he rejects species as units), and our lamentable failure to consider this vital process in our previous theorizing. Echoing my method­ological point that a rarity of recorded examples does not imply any actual weakness in nature, Williams writes (1992, p. 35): “Only the barest begin­nings have been made in searching the fossil record for evidence of clade se­lection. The record can be searched for statistically significant trends in diver­sity and abundance of particular clades ... It can also be searched for consistent selection of certain characters.”

In an expansive and forceful plea for pluralism — representing the finest form of support that a paleontologist could obtain from colleagues engaged in the study of microevolution — Williams (1992, p. 31) then states that allelic change in populations cannot account for evolution because gene-pools func­tion in nature through their entrapment within higher-level individuals oper­ating and interacting as coherent and distinct entities in macroevolution.

The natural selection of alternative alleles, acting largely independently at each locus, is the only force tending to maintain or improve adapta­tions shown by the ephemeral organisms formed by the ephemeral geno­types. If one could look back to the evolution of our own or any other sexually reproducing species, back to well before the Cambrian, no other fitness enhancing process of any importance would be found. Having taken that position, I must take another. The microevolutionary process that adequately describes evolution in a population is an utterly inade­quate account of the evolution of the earth's biota. It is inadequate be­cause the evolution of the biota is more than the mutational origin and subsequent survival or extinction of genes in gene pools. Biotic evolution is also the cladogenetic origin and subsequent survival and extinction of gene pools in the biota.





The Grand Analogy: A Speciational Basis

for Macroevolution





PRESENTATION OF THE CHART FOR MACROEVOLUT1ONARY DISTINCTIVENESS





When Niles Eldredge and I first formulated the theory of punctuated equilib­rium in the early 1970's (Eldredge, 1971; Gould and Eldredge, 1971; Eldredge and Gould, 1972; Gould and Eldredge, 1977), we had only the germ of an insight that its tenets could lend support to a generalized theory of macro-evolution, then entirely undeveloped. We did, however, dimly grasp the key notion that punctuated equilibrium might help to grant species a sufficient stability and coherence for status as what we would now call an evolutionary individual, or unit of selection. We developed this insight by groping towards an analogy that, when generalized and fully fleshed out (with apologies for another parochial organismic metaphor of common language!), sets a foun­dation for macroevolutionary theory. We dimly recognized, in short, that if species act as stable units of geological scales, then evolutionary trends — the fundamental phenomenon of macroevolution — could be conceptualized as results of a “higher order” selection upon a pool of speciational events that might occur at random with respect to the direction of a trend. In such a case, the role of species in a trend would become directly comparable with the clas­sical status of organisms as units of change within a population under natural selection. We wrote (1972, p. 112):

A reconciliation of allopatric speciation with long-term trends can be formulated ... We envision multiple . . . invasions, on a stochastic basis, of new environments by peripheral isolates. There is nothing inherently directional about these invasions. However, a subset of these new environments might... lead to new and improved efficiency ... The overall effect would then be one of net, apparently directional change: but, as with the case of selection upon mutations, the initial variations [species] would be stochastic with respect to the change [trend].



Several paleontologists groped towards a generalization during the next few years, but Stanley (1975, 1979) made the greatest headway in appreciat­ing the full generality of such an analogistic procedure for macroevolutionary theory: “In this higher-level process species become analogous to individuals, and speciation replaces reproduction. The random aspects of speciation take the place of mutation. Whereas, natural selection operates upon individu­als within populations, a process that can be termed species selection oper­ates upon species within higher taxa, determining statistical trends” (Stanley, 1975, p. 648).

Stanley preceded this statement with a claim that I regard as fully justified and prescient, but that became a lightning rod for unfair criticism: “Macroevolution is decoupled from microevolution, and we must envision the pro­cess governing its course as being analogous to natural selection but operat­ing at a higher level of organization” (1975, p. 648). Largely on the basis of this claim about “decoupling,” Stanley, Eldredge and I, and others, were of­ten accused of trying to scuttle Darwinism, and to invent an entirely new (and fatuously speculative) causal apparatus for evolutionary change (meaning, and explicitly so stated in this reductionistic critique, a new genetics).

We made no such claim, and the words quoted above speak for themselves. We were trying to explore the different workings of selection on individuals at levels of the evolutionary hierarchy higher than the conventional Darwin­ian focus upon organisms. Not only do I continue to regard this procedure as fruitful and fully justified, but I would also defend such an effort as the basis for an independent macroevolutionary theory that can harmoniously expand our conventional and exclusive focus on organisms to yield a more satisfac­tory general account of life's workings and history.

I also continue to regard the individuality of species as the central proposi­tion of such an expanded theory. If organisms are the traditional units of se­lection in classical Darwinian microevolution within populations, then spe­cies operate in the same manner as basic units of macroevolutionary change. This perspective establishes an irreducible hierarchical structure in nature, precluding the smooth upward extrapolation of microevolutionary change within populations to explain evolution at all scales, particularly phenotypic trends and patterns of diversity displayed in geological time — the proposition that true devotees of microevolutionary exclusivism rightly feared. If species, as stable units and genuine evolutionary individuals, interpose themselves be­tween populational anagenesis and trends within clades, then the lower-level process cannot smoothly encompass the higher-level phenomenon. For this fundamental (and excellent) reason — and not because any “new” genetics or anti-Darwinian forces reign in a threatening world of macroevolution — Stan­ley introduced his key notion of “decoupling.”

The levels become decoupled because macroevolution must employ species as “atoms,” or stable and basic units of change. Decoupling then becomes in­tensified because higher levels exhibit allometric properties that distinguish their phenomenology from the workings of lower levels. Thus, macroevolu­tion with species as individuals must differ, in deep and interesting ways, from microevolution with organisms as individuals. These differences, and not any fatuous claims about “new genetics,” express the uniqueness of macroevolution, and the validity of our argument for decoupling.

An extensive analogy — “the grand analogy,” if you will (see Gould and Eldredge, 1977, p. 142) — between organismal microevolution and speciational macroevolution provides a good tool for assessing the differences im­posed by scaling among the levels. Stanley (1975, p. 649) and Gould and Eldredge (1977, pp. 142-145) proposed some partial and preliminary schemes, and several others have added components along the way (Stanley, 1979; Vrba, 1980; Grantham, 1995, for example). I present this grand anal­ogy below, largely in the form of a chart contrasting the key features of or­ganic structure and evolution in their organismal and speciational manifesta­tions. For each major category, I list the most important differences between the levels. A fuller explication of all items on the chart follows.





THE PARTICULARS OF MACROEVOLUTIONARY EXPLANATION





The structural basis


The first category of structural differences seems straightforward enough. In order to construct the analogy, we ratchet the focal level of individuality up from the organism to the species, thus redefining both lower components and higher contexts in the structural triad of part-individual-collectivity (see page

673). But this basic ratcheting already reveals some pivotal differences be­tween the evolution of organism-individuals and species-individuals. In Table 8-1, line I2a, for example, notes the profoundly different outcome that usu­ally ensues when particular parts of the individual proliferate differentially and crowd out other parts. Such a process usually spells disaster for a com­plex multicellular organism — and we call the result cancer — because parts lack independent viability (and therefore harm both themselves and their col­lectivity, the organism, by unchecked proliferation), and because organisms build coherence (an important criterion of individuality) by functional inte­gration and division of labor among parts. But species achieve equal coher­ence by other routes. The parts of a species — that is, its component organ­isms — do have independent viability; moreover, their interests in proliferation often coincide with the health of the enclosing species. Thus, in a species-indi­vidual, differential proliferation of some parts at the expense of other parts does not lead to death of the full entity, but usually to adaptation by anagenesis.





Criteria for individuality


Moving to the second category of criteria for individuality (see pp. 602–613 of this chapter), we may regard the species-level analogs of organismal birth and death (lines III—2) — speciation and extinction — as both evident and well recognized. But the different causes of cohesion (line 113) are both fascinating and portentous throughout the chart. I only remind readers that the mecha­nisms used by species, while not clamping down so hard on lower levels, and therefore providing substantial “play” for interaction between organismal and species selection, provide species with as much coherence and stability as the “standard” devices of morphological boundaries, internal policing and functional integration among parts, do for organisms.

Important differences arise in the mode of production for novel variation in newborn individuals. Mutation supplies this attribute at the organismal level. (Following conventional usage, I consider recombination in sexual or­ganisms as a device for spreading variation among individuals, although I recognize, of course, that novel combinations also arise thereby. In asexual organisms, a better analog for species in any case, mutation alone supplies new variation.) Speciation itself is not the proper analog of mutation at the species level (an error previously made both by me, in Gould and Eldredge, 1977, and by Stanley, 1975). Speciation, the production of a new species-individual by budding, is the analog of organismal birth, particularly the birth of asexual organisms. We made this error by inadequately interpreting one of the most interesting differences between organisms and species as evo­lutionary individuals. The birth of a new organism, particularly in asexuals, may or may not engender any substantial difference from parental form or genetics. But the birth of a new species necessarily includes the generation of enough difference from ancestors to preclude reproductive amalgation be­tween the parts (organisms) of the two species. We therefore mistook a forced correlate of birth at the species level (change at speciation) with the process of birth itself (speciation) — and equated the correlate at one level with the phenomenon at the other. The proper analog of mutation, a source of variation for new individuals, is the change that insures reproductive isolation between species (with geographic isolation as a usual precondition, and drift and se­lection as mechanisms) — see line 115.

This difference underlies the two important disparities listed as lines II4a and II5a — one favoring the evolutionary capacity of organisms, the other of species. Sexual organisms can spread favorable variation to other individuals in the collectivity by recombination. But the favorable features of new species remain stuck in the species and its lineal descendants, and cannot be spread to other species in the clade — except in the infrequent circumstance of hybrid­ization among species in a clade of multicellular forms. (By contrast, lateral transfer seems to be common in the evolution of prokaryotic lineages.) This preclusion of lateral spread puts a strong damper upon evolution within clades. The same limitation, of course, affects asexual vs. sexual organisms — and represents a standard argument for the great advantage of sex, and its evolutionary prevalence, in complex metazoans (Williams, 1975; Maynard Smith, 1978).

Species do gain advantages, on the other hand, in the necessary association of birth with change (sometimes small in extent because reproductive isola­tion can develop with minimal genetic change, but usually quite substantial). This input helps to offset the disadvantages of small population sizes (species in clades) for species selection. The asexual budding of a new species always yields novelty; the asexual budding of a new organism usually yields clonal identity, and only produces novelty if mutation intervenes.





Contrasting modalities of change: the basic categories


The greatest interest in this analogy lies in the third category of contrasting modalities. Since individuals vary and collectivities evolve (by cumulative changes in their contained individuals) in the standard formulation, I shall first define the three major styles of change within collectivities (populations for the organismal level, and clades for the species level).

Drive. This term has often been used for particular cases — meiotic drive, or molecular drive, for example — but deserves to be formalized and general­ized. A driving process transforms a collectivity by directionally changing its contained individuals from within. Drives should be construed as opposite or at least orthogonal to selection. Drives produce change by directional trans­formation of relevant individuals, not by differential proliferation of some kinds of individuals over others. Thus, in pure cases of drive, change occurs without any differential proliferation. In the paradigm cases of drive, either an individual alters in the course of ontogeny and passes these modifications to offspring, while all individuals produce the same number of offspring with the same reproductive capacities (so no selection can take place); or an indi­vidual produces offspring endowed with directional differences from its own constitution — but again, no differential reproduction occurs, and no selection can take place. (As one complexity — an ineluctable consequence of the hierarchical perspective, but a blessing in richness rather than a nuisance in con­fusion — drives at one level can result from selection at a lower level. In the obvious case, anagenesis within a species — a drive at the species level — tradi­tionally arises from selection among organisms within the species.)

Sorting (selection and drift). This descriptive term generalizes our usual notion of evolutionary change in a collectivity by differential prolif­eration of some kinds of individuals vs. others. Sorting, as previously defined (p. 659), is a causally neutral and purely descriptive term for any evolution by differential proliferation, whatever the mechanism involved (see original for­mulation in Vrba and Gould, 1986). Of the two major modes of sorting, se­lection, based on causal interaction of traits with environments, ranks as the canonical style of evolution, the essence of Darwin's insight, and the founda­tion of modern theorizing. But sorting can also proceed randomly, a process termed drift. In the hierarchical model, both selection and drift can occur at all levels, under appropriate conditions. I discussed previously, for example, how selectively-based sorting of species can occur either by upward causation from selection at the organismic level (“the effect hypothesis” of Vrba, 1980, also called “effect macroevolution”), or by selection based on irreducible fitness of species-level traits in their interaction with environments (true spe­cies selection) — see pp. 652–670.





Ontogenetic drive: the analogy of Lamarckism and anagenesis


The two categories of drive present some of the most consequential and counterintuitive pairings in the entire table (at least they stimulated my own thoughts substantially). In a first category, line IIIA, we must acknowledge as an instance of “drive” any consistently directional change that occurs during the ontogeny of an individual, and then passes by inheritance to offspring.

We do not usually include such a process in our standard account of evolu­tion for an interesting reason based on the history of evolutionary thought and the nature of Mendelian genetics: We generally focus our causal ac­counts exclusively on organisms in the Darwinian tradition; at the organismic level, a drive of this character would validate the most anathematized and fallacious of alternatives to Darwinism — namely Lamarckism, with “soft” inheritance of acquired characters (see Chapter 3 on Weismann's use of hier­archical thinking to counteract Lamarckism). Thus, ontogenetic drives based on phenotypic changes that are generated by organic activity and then passed to offspring, probably don't exist at the organismal level due to the nature of DNA and the mechanics of heredity. The defeat of Lamarckism — ontogenetic drive in this context — marks one of the great episodes in the history of evolu­tionary thought. If evolution did proceed in the Lamarckian mode, the geo­logical history of life would assume an entirely different appearance, primar­ily by enormously accelerated rates of change, and suppleness of adaptive modification. I doubt, for example, that we would find any stable higher-level entities like species in a Lamarckian world. (Human cultural change com­pares so poorly with Darwinian evolution primarily because our customs and technologies do evolve in this vastly more rapid and flexible Lamarckian mode. Whatever we invent in one generation, we pass directly to the next by emulation and instruction.)

The proper species-level analog for ontogenetic drive, or Lamarckian evolution, sounds a bit bizarre at first — but probably only for the irrelevant psychological reason that we have so firmly rejected the organismic example, while promoting the species-level version as a standard mode of change. With species as individuals and organisms as parts, the gradual transformation (without branching) of an entire species by organismal selection — the stan­dard, canonical description of “evolution” itself — becomes the legitimate an­alog, at the species level, of heritable ontogenetic alteration, or Lamarckian change, at the organismal level! If, as tradition used to hold, such ontogenetic drive dominates macroevolution, then we must record this striking difference in pattern between levels.

I would argue, however (and under my admittedly partisan commitment to punctuated equilibrium), that this standard impression is fictional, and that ontogenetic drive occurs only rarely at the species level. Differences in frequency will, of course, persist — for mechanisms of inheritance preclude ontogenetic drive in theory at the organismic level, while the analogous pro­cess remains possible in principle, though rare in fact, given the nature of populations and their modes of change, at the species level. Thus, small im­portance remains a common theme at both levels. Most species originate in a geological moment, and persist in stasis thereafter (with, at most, mild fluc­tuation about an unvarying mean, but no directional change, as the concept of drive requires — see Chapter 9).

I would also venture an analogy to the organismal level in support of inher­ent reasonableness for the rarity of anagenesis (ontogenetic drive) at the spe­cies level. As argued above, the Lamarckian mode works with extraordi­nary rapidity and efficiency: if organisms changed in this way, we could not fail to notice, because evolution would then operate so differently. I would suggest that we approach macroevolution at the species level in the same way. If species changed gradually most of the time, the pageant of life's his­tory, as shown by the fossil record, would present an entirely different ap­pearance. The most extensive transformations would occur in a few million years at most. (Many hypothetical calculations have been made to illustrate this point — for example, that a small, four-footed, terrestrial mammal can evolve into the largest whale in a fraction of Tertiary time, so long as a sin­gle population in transformation maintains the smallest effectively measur­able selection coefficient, unabated and without change in direction.)* Stable clades could not dominate the history of life, as they manifestly do, particu­larly in marine invertebrates (clams, snails, horseshoe crabs, brachiopods, all from the Paleozoic to the present); nor, among more rapidly changing terres­trial clades, could dinosaurs (not to mention the more stable insects) persist and rule for so long in a world where most species evolved continually by the analog of ontogenetic drive in the Lamarckian mode.

Of course, we could posit other reasons for braking the rapidity and ef­ficiency of change by ontogenetic drive in macroevolution — disruption of trends by mass extinction; high frequency of trends that benefit organisms but harm species (peacock's tails), for example. But I suspect that the simplest of all reasons will explain the evident pattern: the species-level analog of ontogenetic drive — gradual transformation within a species — just doesn't oc­cur very often.

Finally, I note that R. A. Fisher's classic argument for the impotence of spe­cies selection rests on the standard assumption that this mode of driving does prevail in evolution. For, if most species, most of the time, changed gradually from within (see pp. 644–646), then selection among species would be, as Fisher rightly noted, an operative but impotent process, capable of generating only an insignificant amount of change relative to the dominant and ubiqui­tous drives of anagenesis. But if anagenesis rarely occurs, Fisher's argument collapses. I wonder if Fisher ever explicitly realized that anagenesis would trump species-selection because anagensis is Lamarckian at the species level, while species selection is Darwinian at the same level — for Lamarckian pro­cesses can always overwhelm the much weaker force of Darwinian change if both operate generally and in an unimpeded manner at the same level.





Reproductive drive: directional speciation as an important

and irreducible macroevolutionary mode separate from

species selection


Thus, the first category of ontogenetic drive illustrated interesting differences in style between levels, but little variation in effect — for I conclude that this mode has scant impact upon evolution at either level. But when we consider the second category of reproductive drive (biased production of offspring that vary in a given direction from parents), we encounter one of the chart's most striking disparities — a crucial, yet almost entirely unrecognized and un­explored difference in basic pattern between micro- and macroevolution. To choose a hypothetical example of simplified form but maximal clarity: Sup­pose that each collectivity (a population for the organismal level, or a clade for the species level) contains ten individuals (organisms or species, for the two levels). Each individual gives birth to a single offspring, and all offspring have identical life spans and reproductive capacities. Thus, no selection at all can take place. Now suppose that a strong bias exists in production of off­spring, so that 80 percent arise with smaller bodies than their parent (lower weight for the offspring organisms, lower average body weight for the off­spring species). Suppose also that this pattern continues from generation to generation. This driving process would generate a strong trend to smaller bodies in the collectivities at both levels — a gradual trend to decreased body size in the population at the organismal level; and to species with smaller av­erage body sizes within the clade at the species level.

As discussed previously (p. 691), reproductive drives of this kind can occur at the organismal level, and a variety of names for such processes exist, in­cluding mutation pressure and meiotic drive. But the Darwinian tradition has always regarded such phenomena as insignificant as a consequence of their rarity. Indeed, these processes must be rare in a fully Darwinian world, be­cause reproductive drives violate the necessary precondition of undirected variability for natural selection (see pp. 144–146). Darwinians did not win this debate by simple logic or evident factuality, but only by a great intellec­tual struggle marking a crucial episode in the history of evolutionary thought. The classical debate about orthogenesis, for example (see Chapter 5), cen­tered upon the Darwinian denial of such reproductive drives, which, as the competing orthogeneticists all realized, would overwhelm selection by higher efficacy — if they existed. Perhaps such reproductive drives rarely occur at this level in nature because, having no known basis for inherent adaptivity, they have been actively suppressed by organismal selection — another potential ex­ample of the most distinctive feature of organismic individuality: the power evolved by functional integrity to suppress lower-level selection from within.

However, when we move to the species level, the analogous driving phenomenon of directional speciation suffers no constraint or suppression — and may represent one of the most common modes of macroevolution. Two ma­jor reasons underlie the high potential frequency for directional speciation (as opposed to the rarity of its analog at the organismal level — see line III2a on the chart). First, as noted in several other contexts, the species-individual does not maintain integrity (as the organism does) by suppressing differential proliferation of some parts over others. Since drives at an upper level arise by differential proliferation of lower-level units, this absence of suppression leaves a large open field for driving processes to operate at the birth of new species. Second, since new species-individuals must arise with sufficient heri­table novelty to win reproductive isolation from their parent (whereas chil­dren of asexual organisms may be clonally identical with parents), all species births include genetic change as an automatic consequence. Any statistical directionality in such changes among species in a clade will produce a trend by drive.*

We may postulate any number of plausible circumstances that would gen­erate directional biases in the origin of new species — thus producing a cladal trend without any contribution from species selection. Moreover, potential causes for directional bias exist at all levels — organismic, demic, or species — thus greatly expanding the scope of the phenomenon. As a central theoretical point, directional speciation, when based on irreducible species-level proper­ties, represents a style of independent and causal macroevolution not based on species selection. Thus, the claim for an independent body of macroevolutionary theory does not depend upon the validity and high relative fre­quency of the Darwinian analog most often discussed as a paradigm case, namely species selection. Directional speciation, when based on irreducible species-level traits or processes, designates another category of intrinsically macroevolutionary change.

To continue in the hypothetical mode with the example cited previously, one can easily imagine how a cladal trend, attributable entirely to reproduc­tive drive (and not at all to selection), and leading to decreasing average (organismal) body size, might be caused at either the organismal, demic, or species level. At the conventional organismic level, a pervasive environmental change over the entire region of a clade's occupancy might favor natural selection for smaller bodies. (Perhaps, to choose a somewhat cardboard ex­ample, a temperate region has become tropical, and smaller organisms now gain advantages within each species of a clade by the adaptive correlates of Bergmann's Rule.) Each species produces a single daughter species and then dies out — so no selection can occur at the species level. But if most species, in the new climatic regime, originate at smaller average body size because natu­ral selection favors this trait among the organisms in each species, then the cladal trend arises by directional speciation with a cause based on selection at the organismal level — the classic case of a drive at a higher level produced by directional selection among contained parts at a lower level.

For a hypothetical case based on interdemic selection, suppose that each species in a clade develops ten small and isolated demes at the periphery of the parental range. Suppose that average body size in these peripheral isolates varies randomly around the parental mean. Suppose further that, for each species, only one of the ten peripheral demes survives, intensifies its differ­ences, and eventually becomes a new species — while the parent and the other nine peripheral isolates all die. Again, no species selection can take place, for each parent spawns one and only one daughter. (I realize, of course, that these strictures sound absurd if construed as actual and coordinated occurrences in nature; I am only following the time-honored heuristic method in science of constructing “pure” end-member hypothetical to help clarify our thoughts.)

Finally, let us say that, in general, the surviving (and ultimately speciating) deme lies at or near the smaller-bodied end of the random distribution (around the parental mean) of average body size. Let us also posit that the smaller average body size of new species arises as a consequence of a deme-level property conveying differential success in interdemic selection among the ten peripheral isolates initially spun off from each species. An obvious (and not implausible) reason might be found in a strong correlation between small bodies and larger N in any population (the “more ants than elephants” principle, albeit in a more restricted range). The surviving deme might owe its success to generally larger population size in a tough peripheral environment.

The cladal trend to smaller body size among species would then arise by a drive of directional speciation (new species biased to originate with smaller-bodied organisms than those of their ancestors, in a situation where no spe­cies selection can occur). The cause of the trend, in this hypothetical case, will be interdemic selection — for the ten peripheral isolates arise as demes of the parental species. Selection among these demes favors those with smaller aver­age body size, based on correlation with the causally controlling deme-level property of larger population size. This deme-level property confers an irre­ducible fitness upon demes in their interaction with the environment. (In an extreme, albeit improbable, case, interdemic selection based on larger popu­lation size could even outweigh negative organismic selection against small bodies.) Again, a drive at the species level arises by selection among lower-level parts, in this case demes rather than organisms.

Finally, an irreducible species-level character may cause a drive at the species level. Suppose that each species spins off only one peripherally iso­lated population and that, invariably, the parental population dies while the peripheral isolate becomes a new species. Suppose that the single peripheral deme, generated by each species, generally features organisms with a smaller average body size than the organisms of the parental population. Suppose that this directional bias arises as a result of a species-level trait in the paren­tal population. Perhaps, for example, the social structuring or territorial sys­tem of the parental population preferentially excludes smaller organisms of both sexes, and that these smaller organisms therefore tend to migrate to the species border, where they aggregate to form the isolated population that will generate a new species. (Again, the case merely requires conceivability for purposes of illustration, not plausibility.) In this situation, no selection can occur at the species level because each parental species produces one daughter species and then dies. The cladal trend to species with smaller average body size arises by the driving process of directional speciation — and the cause lies in a species-level trait of the parental population. As stated above, we here en­counter a case of irreducible macroevolution not based on species selection. Examples of this kind illustrate that the domain of independent macroevolutionary theory extends well beyond the phenomenology of Darwinian ana­logs in species selection.

As an additional argument for the importance of directional speciation as a driving force in evolution — and as an example of interesting complexity engendered by the hierarchical model (and of differences in the character of explanation between this hierarchical reformulation, and the traditional one-level world of Darwinian evolution) — note what often happens when causes at one level correlate with emergent properties involved in causes at a higher level; for we then encounter the fascinating situation of disparate theoretical meanings for inexorably linked phenomena at two levels. (We have already discussed one common example in the causation of higher-level drives by lower-level selection.) Another important example, potentially encompassing one of the dominant phenomena of macroevolution, translates the results of ordinary selection at the organismal level into strong constraints acting as causes of directional speciation at the species level. In this sense, when consid­ered at the appropriate higher level, macroevolutionary pattern results much more from immediate constraint, and less from the traditional selection­ist mode, than we have generally been willing to allow — thus suggesting an­other potentially important reform and expansion of Darwinian thinking (see Chapter 10 for a fuller discussion).

Consider two cases of cladal trends produced by the driving cause of directional speciation. Figure 8-6 depicts the common pattern in both examples. At a starting point, the clade contains two kinds of species in equal num­bers — those bearing trait A, and those bearing trait B. Every reproducing spe­cies generates two daughters and no variation exists for differences in species birth rates among those species that have offspring — so no species selection can occur. Evolution proceeds rapidly by directional speciation because A-Species can only produce A-Daughters, while B-Species produce 50 percent





8-6. A cladal trend produced entirely by directional speciation with no species selection. A species can only produce A daughters, while B species produce 50% A daughters and 50% B daughters. Under these conditions of strongly direc­tional speciation, a powerful trend towards A leading to quick disappearance of B from the clade, will arise, even under a regime of random mortality among species.





A-Daughters and 50 percent B-Daughters. (If we posit random mortality of a given percentage of species before they split into their daughters, as in Fig. 8-6, then B-Species will eventually be entirely eliminated, and A-Species will become fixed in the clade.)

A first kind of example would not disturb the tranquility of any committed adaptationist, for a functionalist theme translates well across the levels. Sup­pose that Cope's Rule were true in the classical sense — it is not, by the way (Stanley, 1973; Jablonski, 1987, 1997; McShea, 1994; Gould, 1988b, 1997b, and pp. 902–905 of this book) — and that organismal selection always fa­vored size increase because big organisms prevail in competition. A-Species are large and B-Species are small; A's only give rise to other A's, while B's give rise either to A's (given the pervasive advantage of increasing size), or to B's at equal frequency (for small size may still be favored in some habitats of the clade). The strong Cope's-Rule trend in the clade occurs by directional speciation. The adaptationist theme prevails at both levels. Average organisms in the clade become larger because bigger is better; and species increase in aver­age body size because their parts (organisms) do better at larger size. (No spe­cies-level trait exists in regulating this trend, and the entire phenomenon arises by conventional organismal selection based on advantages of increased body size.)

But a second kind of example — undoubtedly quite common in evolution — would perturb a strict adaptationist by translating selection at the organismic level to regulation of the cladal trend by constraint. Suppose now — and such an explanation has been urged as an alternative to species selection for the increase of nonplanktotrophic species within Tertiary clades of gastropods (Strathmann, 1978, 1988) — that a molluscan clade begins with an equal number of species of nonplanktotrophs (A-Species) and plankotrophs (B-Spe­cies). Planktotrophic larvae stay aloft through the motion of complex ciliary bands that beat in concert. Selection pressures for nonplanktotrophy lead to loss of these bands, and consequent benthic development of a maternally protected brood. Plankotrophs can always, in principle, convert to non­planktotrophy because the bands can be lost; but the transition cannot pro­ceed in the other direction because ciliary bands can't be reconstituted once they have disappeared in evolution (see Gould, 1970b, on the proper mean­ing of Dollo's Law of irreversibility in evolution).

The origin of each species may be governed entirely by the conventional route of adaptation based on natural selection of organisms. But a structural limitation in possible directions of change produces the cladal trend by direc­tional speciation towards increasing frequency of nonplanktotrophic spe­cies — for a planktotrophic parent species can generate either planktotrophic or nonplanktotrophic daughters, while a nonplanktotrophic parent can only produce nonplanktotrophic daughters. The numerical situation corresponds exactly with Figure 8-6 and the previous example based on Cope's Rule (with A-Species now read as nonplanktotrophs, and B-Species as planktotrophs), but the explanation at the cladal level differs crucially — for the trend arises by structural constraint upon possible directions of change, not from any general or global advantage for nonplanktotrophic organisms. (In fact, planktotrophic species might hold a small advantage in species selection for longevity, and the trend to nonplanktotrophy might still arise by directional speciation under this potent constraint.)

I strongly suspect that trends driven by structural constraints within large systems, and not by adaptational advantages to organisms, pervade evolu­tion, but have been missed because we focus on means or extremes in a distri­bution and not on the full range of variation as a more telling “reality” (see Gould, 1996a, for an entire book on this subject, written for popular readers; and Gould, 1988b, for a technical account). The vaunted trend to increasing complexity in the history of life, for example, only records the small and ex­tending tail of an increasingly right-skewed distribution through time — but with a strong and persistent bacterial mode that has never altered during life's entire 3.5 billion year history, leaving this planet now, as always, in the Age of Bacteria (see pp. 897–901 for a further development of this example). This extending right tail may record little more than the constraint of life's origin right next to the lower bound of preservable complexity in the fossil record. Only one direction — towards greater complexity — remained open to “inva­sion,” and a small number of species dribble in that direction through time, thus extending the right tail of the skewed distribution.* But no evidence now exists to support an argument that higher complexity should be construed as a “good thing in general” (in adaptive terms, or otherwise), either at the organismal or species level. In fact, the few studies based on patterns of speciation in clades where founding members lie far from any upper or lower structural boundary, and therefore impose no constraint upon either decreas­ing or increasing complexity, show no trend at all towards increasing com­plexity. Approximately equal numbers of species arise with less complex and with more complex phenotypes than their ancestor (see McShea, 1993, on mammalian vertebral columns; McShea, Hall, Grimsson and Gingerich, 1995, on mammalian teeth; and Boyajian and Lutz, 1992, on ammonite sutures).





Species selection, Wright’s Rule, and the power of interaction

with directional speciation


I have long regarded species selection as the most challenging and interesting of macroevolutionary phenomena, and the most promising centerpiece for macroevolutionary theory. While I continue to espouse this view, my rethink­ing for this chapter has led me to appreciate the significant power of two other species-level processes: drives of directional speciation as just discussed (see also Gould, 1982c), and species drift, the higher-level analog of genetic drift. I would now argue that the interaction of these three processes sets the distinctive character of macroevolution.

As for natural selection at the organismic level, the two major modes of species selection operate by differential rates of generating daughter species (the analog of birth biases in natural selection) and differential geological lon­gevity before extinction (the analog of death biases in natural selection). At the species level, however, the difference between these two modes does not rest upon the same basis that distinguishes their analogs at the organismic level.

At the organismal level, natural selection by birth bias works mainly upon such “internal” traits as reproductive rate and brood size, and often doesn't increase adaptation in the conventional sense of phenotypic molding to bet­ter biomechanical design for local environments. For example, an organism gains a large selective advantage merely by breeding a bit earlier, though nothing else about the phenotype need alter (Gould and Lewontin, 1979, re­ferred to this mode as “selection without adaptation”). But natural selection by death bias among organisms usually yields phenotypic adaptation for better fit to the ambient environment.

At the species level, however, our main concern moves to an interesting difference in causal locus. Most cases of selection by differential speciation operate by the interaction of an irreducible species-level character — some feature of population structure — with the environment, and therefore represent gen­uine species selection. After all, and as stated before, organisms don't speciate; only populations do. But for selection by differential extinction, a higher frequency of cases can probably be explained as the simple summation of organismal deaths, and may therefore be causally rendered at this conven­tional lower level — for both organisms and species die. Thus, students of spe­cies selection have rightly focussed on differential speciation as their most promising category (see Gilinsky, 1981, for both theoretical arguments and empirical examples).

However, the most interesting of all differences between organismal and species selection may lie not in the phenomena themselves, but rather in the character of their interaction with the two other primary modes of evolution­ary change: drives, and drift (I shall discuss drift in the next section). Our sense of the commanding potency of organismal selection rests upon the conformity of Mendelian genetics to one of the cardinal prerequisites of Darwin­ian systems (see Chapter 2): that the variation serving as raw material for nat­ural selection be “random” (with an operational meaning of “undirected towards adaptive states,” not “equally likely in all directions”) — so that se­lection, rather than biases inherent in variation, can become the “creative” force in evolutionary change (see p. 144 for further discussion in a related context). This crucial condition can be validated at the organismic level — not because mutations (and other sources of genetic variation) are truly random in the mathematical sense, but because mutation represents a process so dif­ferent from natural selection, and operating on material (the structure of DNA) so disparate from the bodies of organisms (integrated tissues and or­gans), that we cannot postulate a reason why favored directions of mutation should correspond in any way to the needs of organisms.

But no comparable argument exists for any a priori expectation that the analogous variation (among species within a clade) made available for species selection should also be random with respect to the direction of a trend. Spe­cies do not discourage drives among their parts (organisms), while organisms usually do suppress directional variation at lower levels (because the proliferative “interests” of individual genes and cell lineages generally run counter to the adaptive needs of organisms). Moreover, the adaptive features of organ­isms often confer benefits upon their species as well — as when species live longer because their well-designed organisms prevail in competition. There­fore, we cannot defend an a priori basis for asserting randomness in the varia­tion that serves as raw material for species selection.

This situation creates both a problem and a challenge for the analog of Darwinism at the species level — for maximal efficiency of species selection does demand undirected variability, and by the same classical argument origi­nally devised for the organismic level. The randomness of species-level varia­tion with respect to the direction of a trend therefore becomes a matter for empirical testing, rather than a claim predictably flowing from the nature of materials and processes. Such a test should also receive high priority for any­one interested in discovering the frequency and strength of species selection in the explanation of evolutionary trends.

For these reasons, Gould and El dredge (1977) formulated such a test under the name of “Wright's Rule.” We took our cue from a prescient statement by Sewall Wright (1967) that the direction of speciation might be random with respect to the origin of higher taxa, just as we consider mutation to be ran­dom relative to the direction of natural selection. Wright's Rule, in our for­mulation, therefore asserts either that drives of directional speciation do not exist at all in a given situation (the strong version), or at least that any exist­ing directional bias not occur along the vector of an established trend (a weaker version, but fully adequate for assertions of species selection). If Wright's Rule holds, then trends must be attributed to differential prolifera­tion of certain kinds of species (by selection or drift), and not to any drives from within based on directional variation arising from lower-level processes.

Wright's Rule represents a strong test for putative species selection, but I now realize that its failure does not eliminate species selection from consider­ation. When Wright's Rule holds, a trend must be attributed to species sort­ing, for no directional component exists at the lower level of variation among units of sorting. But if Wright's Rule fails in any particular case, then species selection cannot forge the trend exclusively — although species selection may still operate as one contribution in a hierarchical system. A speciational drive may act synergistically with species selection to intensify a trend. (Since drives tend to be more potent than selection, a powerful drive, with strong violation of Wright's Rule, will probably relegate species selection to an insignificant role. But small departures from Wright's Rule permit a substantial intensi­fication of the trend by species selection. In any case, and in situations of un­usually complete paleontological data, we should be able to measure the rela­tive strengths of drive and sorting when the two modes act synergistically.)

Wright's Rule has been tested in some cases, but not often enough — and the subject remains ripe for future research, including several Ph.D. theses! Gould and Eldredge (1977) found Wright's Rule validated for Gingerich's data on early Tertiary Hyopsodus. MacFadden (1986) failed to confirm Wright's Rule in the evolution of horses, where a directional bias exists for descendant species to arise at larger body sizes than their ancestors. Arnold, Kelly, and Parker (1995) validated Wright's Rule for a remarkably complete data set of 342 ancestral-descendant pairs in Cenozoic planktonic foraminifera. An equal number of species arose at larger and at smaller sizes than ancestors; see Figure 8-7. In a pioneering study, notable for completeness and density of data (and a consequent capacity to distinguish among all the vari­ous modes of evolutionary change), Wagner (1996) documented three general and speciational trends in the evolution of gastropods during the lower Paleo­zoic (Cambrian through Silurian): towards higher spires, more inclined aper­tures and narrower sinuses. For 276 ancestor-descendant pairs over the en­tire clade, Wagner confirmed Wright's Rule for spire height and inclination, where as many species differed from ancestors in a direction away from the general trend, as along the ultimately favored route. But data for sinus width, where a statistically significant bias exists for speciation in the direction of

The bottom diagram demonstrates that the first two trends obey Wright's Rule in showing no bias in species origins in the direction of the trend. However, the trend for sinus width does show a bias for new species to originate in the direction of narrower sinuses — thus yielding a complex trend, partly produced by directional speciation, and not entirely by species selection. From Wagner, 1996.







narrower sinuses, falsified Wright's Rule (see Fig. 8-8) and documented a drive of directional speciation. Wagner further demonstrated (1996, p. 1000) that “this bias is distributed throughout the entire clade,” for three major subclades all display the drive. Nonetheless — and showing the power of such data to identify and tease apart the different components of a trend into their relative quantitative strengths — Wagner also documented a component of species sorting in the overall trend to narrower sinuses, for “species with wide sinuses were significantly less likely to survive the end-Ordovician mass ex­tinction” (1996, p. 990).

I would go further and suggest that synergisms of drive and sorting (as Wagner has documented for the trend to narrower sinuses in Paleozoic gas­tropods) should be common in the history of many clades, and probably mark a powerful mode of macroevolution distinct from conventional microevolution, where such synergism must be rare. Good a priori reasons exist for supposing that features biasing the directionality of speciation might also fa­vor sorting towards the same end. Such synergism should be most evident when the causes of both bias and sorting work at the same (usually organismic) level — as when, for example, a trait under strongly positive organismic selection (like large body size) arises preferentially in speciation events, and then promotes the greater longevity of species so originating. But such syner­gisms may also be common when causes differ in level — as when, for exam­ple, a drive occurs by organismal selection, and species-selection then causes sorting in the same direction. For, unlike the situation at the next lower pair­ing of levels (where genic and cell lineage selection so often run counter to the interest of organismal selection, and consequently become suppressed), selec­tion at the organismal level does not conflict in principle with selection at the species level. Selection at these two levels should, therefore, be synergistic as often as opposed. Such synergisms should therefore be frequent and powerful in macroevolution.





Species-level drifts as more powerful than the analogous

phenomena in microevolution


At the organismal level, the second major mode of sorting — drift by random processes — operates in two ways that should be distinguished both for poten­tially different roles and frequencies at this level, and because the species-level analogs diverge even more clearly. We may distinguish random shift within the collectivity — called genetic drift at the conventional organismal level — from random effects introduced at the founding of new demes or species by small numbers of organisms. Mayr (1942) introduced the term “founder ef­fect” to distinguish this second category (though the basic mechanism does not differ from ordinary genetic drift), and to emphasize that the differences initiating a new species need not arise entirely by natural selection, but may be significantly enhanced by random effects at the outset, because a small number of founders will, for stochastic reasons, surely not begin a new popu­lation with the same gene frequencies as the ancestral population, while some alleles (even if favorable) will be lost by random non-inclusion in all founding organisms.

Although both genetic drift and founder effects obviously occur at the organismal level, our traditions have tended to downplay the role of random processes vs. selection as sources of sorting — so the phenomena generally re­ceive short shrift. Some conventional arguments for genuine rarity at the organismal level may be valid, particularly given the requirement for either small populations or effective neutrality of drifting sites. (The initiating crite­rion of low N may, however, be quite generally met if Mayr's theory of peripatric speciation holds, hence his emphasis on the “founder principle.” Similarly, if bottlenecking to very small numbers typically occurs during the history of many species, then genetic drift also becomes important in ana­genesis. The argument for effective neutrality, as discussed previously (pp. 684–689), works best at the genic level, where drift may predominate by Kimura's neutral theory of molecular evolution.)

However, at the species level, these traditional objections to high frequency for drift become invalid, and we should anticipate a major role for this sec­ond cause of sorting. Low population size (number of species in a clade) pro­vides the enabling criterion for important drift in both categories at the spe­cies level. The analog of genetic drift — which I shall call “species drift” — must act both frequently and powerfully in macroevolution. Most clades do not contain large numbers of species. Therefore, trends may often originate for effectively random reasons. Consider a trend produced by random deaths (a comparable argument can easily be made for random birth differentials), based on Raup's “field of bullets” model (1991 and Chapter 12). Suppose, for example, that each of the ten species of a clade lives in a small area, with each species allopatric to all others. Over a certain period of time, a bolide (or some gentler environmental change with power to drive a local species to ex­tinction) strikes half the areas at random and eliminates the resident species of the clade while each of the species in the five safe areas branches off a daughter, thus restoring the cladal population of 10 species. At an N this low, some trends (and perhaps a substantial number) will inevitably arise by this mode of random removal. Perhaps, for example, four of the five species with mean body size below the cladal average will happen to die. A substantial random trend to increased body size then occurs within the clade.

When we move from the homogenous “field of bullets” model to a scaling of effects in the real world, and consider the consequences of infrequent, but severe, mass extinction on a global scale, the potential role of random trends by elimination only increases — for random effects based on small numbers will be greatly intensified. (The reduction of species number in mass extinc­tion may be conventionally causal, but the final death of the clade, after re­duction to less than a handful of species, may then be effectively random. For example, so few trilobite species still lived when the great Permian extinction occurred that I'm not sure we need to seek a “trilobite specific” cause for the final elimination of this previously dominant group.)

When we move to the second category of random results achieved by sort­ing in the colonization of new places — the analog of the founder effect — then comparison with the organismal version becomes less straightforward, al­though we may be confident that the species-level version holds potential for great importance in evolution. The species-level analog, which I will call “founder drift” (see lines IIIC2 and IIIC2a), does not work through a sim­ple phenotypic difference between a colonizing species and the parental stay-at-home — for all species differ by definition, and disparities arise by the usual combination of selective and random effects, usually expressed at the organismic level. The stochastic analog to Mayr's “founder effect” at the organismal level lies in random aspects of the differential capacity for prolif­eration of new species in allopatric regions of a clade's full range.

A hypothetical example will illustrate this unfamiliar concept. Suppose that a clade contains only two species, living in adjacent islands with simi­lar environments. The islands, however, lie on different oceanic plates, and movements of plate tectonics cause the coalescence of one island with a large neighboring continent, while leaving the other island in the midst of the ocean. The species on the continent proliferates into a large subclade of new species, while the species on the island, lacking any room for expansion, re­mains as the only species of its subclade. Because the process of speciation yields phenotypic disparity intrinsically, the founding continental species will differ from its insular sister species. Therefore, the clade will show a strong trend in the direction of autapomorphic traits possessed by the continental founder. But such a trend will often be entirely random with respect to the plurified traits of the continental founder. That is, these spreading traits may be completely neutral in the crucial sense that if the other (insular) species had colonized the island that coalesced with the continent instead, its autapomorphies would have proliferated, and the cladal trend would have pro­ceeded with the same force, but in the opposite direction. Only the luck of residence on one island rather than the other (and not any preferential inter­action of some traits vs. others with the environment) leads to the differential proliferation of one species's traits over those of the sister species.

Situations of this sort must be common, if not virtually canonical, in evolution. Almost any two geographic regions must maintain differential capacity to house species of a given clade. If both regions are colonized by founding species, and, many million years later, one region holds substantially more species than the other, the random component of spatial and ecological op­portunity must often play a greater role in differential speciation than the se­lective force of greater capacity for differential proliferation in one subclade vs. the other based on interactions of traits with environments. I use the term random in a special, but surely legitimate, sense. Suppose that a large and ecologically diverse Region 1 can accommodate 50 species of a subclade, while smaller and more homogeneous Region 2 can only maintain 10 (I real­ize that species create their own environments, and that regions don't main­tain fixed numbers of available addresses, but I invoke this simplification for the sake of argument). Subclade A invades Region 1, while Subclade B be­gins in Region 2. The resulting strong cladal trend toward the autapomorphic characters of Subclade A cannot be called accidental in the global sense — for Region 1 does predictably accommodate more species. But the trend may be accidental in the sense that Subclade A, rather than Subclade B, happened to invade the more prosperous region — and that if Subclade B had been the colonizer, its progeny would have done equally well, and would have dominated the cladal trend with the same force actually shown by Subclade A. In this case, we call the trend random because A's success does not arise from any superiority of an interacting trait (vs. B's phenotype), but only from the accident of colonizing a more propitious place (see Eble, 1999, and Chap­ter 11 of this book for a discussion of this evolutionary meaning of “ran­dom”).

As with the relationship between directional speciation and species selec­tion, these two forms of species-level drift must often interact with the other main cause of sorting — i.e., selection — to produce a trend (as when Subclade A, in the example just above, increases both by the good fortune of greater opportunity, and by selective benefits conferred by its traits). The organismic level may experience a higher relative frequency of domination by selective forces, but the world of species evolves by complex interactions among the processes of drive, selection, and drift.





The scaling of external and internal environments


I have not tried to develop an exhaustive comparison between levels for influ­ences of external and internal environments upon the modes of change dis­cussed in previous sections. But I offer a few sketchy comments to encourage further work in this area.

For environmental factors that induce competition among individuals and therefore establish selection pressures (line IVA of the chart), I contrast modes that involve direct contact among individuals with those that can proceed in allopatry. At the organismic level, this contrast exposes a strong correlation between prevalence of biotic factors in direct contact and abiotic factors in allopatry. At the species level, a different correlation may dominate: the asso­ciation of selection by differential elimination with direct contact, and selec­tion by differential birth with allopatry (lines IVA1 and IVA2).

This contrast also leads to different implications at the two levels. At the organismic level, as Darwin himself argued in his primary justification for progress in the history of life (see Chapter 6), the biotic mode correlates more often with adaptation by general biomechanical improvement, and the abiotic mode with adaptation to local circumstances of the physical envi­ronment, with no vectorial component as environments fluctuate randomly through time. At the species level, we may expect to find a strong correlation of selection by differential elimination with potential reduction to the organismal level, while selection by differential birth represents the most promising domain for true and irreducible species selection.

For constraints of internal environments (line IVB), I make a distinction between negative factors that limit amounts and directions of change, and positive properties that channel change in certain directions, or provide par­ticular opportunities for evolutionary novelties and breakthroughs. (I also base Chapter 10, this book's major discussion of constraint, on the same dis­tinction.) The operation of these constraints often differs in interesting ways at the two levels.

For some of the important limits, line IVB1 specifies a major shaping force of life's structure, a factor not often explicitly acknowledged. Why does the world contain stable individuals at all, and at any level? Why doesn't evo­lution work as continuous flux at all scales, rather than primarily by selec­tion upon individuals stable enough to persist, at least through one round of differential sorting? Comparable reasons can be stated at both the organismic and species levels, thus giving evolution its primary shape or structure: Lamarckian inheritance does not occur at the organismal level, thus stabiliz­ing the ontogeny of heritable variability. At the species level, punctuated equi­librium suppresses anagenesis by maintaining species-individuals in stasis.

When we explore the structural brakes that limit amounts of change in most trends (line IVB2), several factors could be mentioned, but I just list, as an example, the single property that I consider most important. For organ­isms, those paragons of individuality by the criterion of structural and func­tional integrity, design limits of the Bauplan (both internally by structural constraint, and externally by adaptive possibilities) place strong brakes upon almost any evolutionary trend. Contrary to the themes of several popular films, elephants will never fly, and insects will not reach elephantine propor­tions and engulf our cities as a plague of megalocusts.

At the species level, Stanley (1979) made an important observation that has not been sufficiently appreciated for its defining force in limiting the possibili­ties of species selection. If we consider the two major modes of positive spe­cies selection — enhancing the rate of production for new species, and extend­ing the geological longevity of existing species — why shouldn't some lineages be able to maximize both properties simultaneously, thus becoming gigantic megaclades, dominating the earth's biota? (Perhaps, of course, a few clades have been able to approach this ideal — thus explaining the great success of beetles and nematodes.) In other words, why don't clades ratchet themselves towards this pinnacle by species selection — by working both ends of the game, and evolving species of extraordinary durability and fantastic rates of branching, superspecies that live for several geological periods and spawn large numbers of daughters all along the way?

Stanley (1979) argues, with extensive data in support, that the nature of speciation as a process, and the general rules of ecology, engenders a strong, and effectively unbreakable, negative correlation between speciation and ex­tinction rates. Unfortunately for ambitious species with dreams of mega-cladal domination (but happily for any ideal of a richly varied biota), the ma­jor factors that boost speciation rates also raise the probability of extinction; while features that enhance longevity also suppress the rate of speciation. For example, small populations in stressful environments are especially prone to both speciating and dying; while large, global populations of marked stability and great mobility (like Homo sapiens and Rattus rattus) are remarkably re­sistant to extinction (unless, like one of the above, they evolve an odd capac­ity for potential self-destruction), but ill-equipped to form the isolated popu­lations that can generate new species.

For a third limiting constraint of brakes on the amount of available varia­tion for selectional processes (line IVB3), infrequency of new mutation may play an important role at the organismal level (not so often in sexual forms, where recombination greatly boosts the amount of variability among individ­uals, but usually a defining limit in asexuals, and perhaps the major reason for the rarity and marginal status of asexuals among complex Metazoa, but not in unicells with short generations). At the species level, variation per indi­vidual may be more than adequate (given the forced correlation of birth with change), but many clades contain too few individuals, giving birth too rarely, for very efficient selection (Fisher's argument — see page 645).

For a final factor among limiting constraints (in this abbreviated list), brakes on development act strongly at both levels (line IVB4). Ever since the inception of modern embryology, von Baer's (1828) laws have defined the hold placed by ontogenetic intricacy upon potentials for change in complex Metazoa. At the species level, the hold of homology (as expressed in all the factors, genetic and otherwise, that limit the amount of change per speciation event) functions as a developmental constraint in the same basic manner — that is, by limiting the difference that can separate a parent and its immediate offspring.

All these sources of limitation also contribute to the more important posi­tive aspects of constraint, as channeling or enhancing preferred directions for change. In the category of positive channeling by structure (line IVB5), onto­genetic pathways already established in the lives of organisms provide by extension, or by relative shuffling of rates among components (see Gould, 1977b), the classic mode of constrained and substantial change in organismic evolution — thus explaining the importance of heterochrony as a morphogenetic phenomenon (Jones and Gould, 1999; McNamara and McKinney, 1991). At the upper level of speciational trends within clades, structural rules and differential ease of modifiability among parts and correlations of Bauplan play the same role of directing and accelerating change along cer­tain preferred pathways. Liem (1973), for example, showed how a set of small and accessible changes in a jaw muscle, the fourth levator externi, could greatly alter the adaptive feeding devices of cichlid fishes (but not of other re­lated groups), thus helping to explain the rapidly evolved species flocks of this clade in several African lakes.

In a second category of positive channeling by directed variability from lev­els below, the organismic level experiences no important effect because such drives will generally be suppressed by organismic selection. But the driving force of directional speciation can greatly enhance and channel cladal trends by working synergistically with such species-level modes of change as species selection.

Perhaps the most important positive constraint, acting similarly at both levels, lies in the large size of “exaptive pools” (see full discussion in Chapter 11), or nonrandom variation made available through evolutionary processes acting on other features or at other levels, but later exploitable by organisms or species for their own exaptive benefits. The redundancy supplied by ge­netic duplication for organismal flexibility serves as the classic illustration of this phenomenon at the traditional level of natural selection. The exaptive pool of the species level may become even larger because species do not sup­press lower levels of change, while these genic and organismal directionalities frequently act in synergism with advantages at the species level (see Gould and Lloyd, 1999, for a detailed development of this argument).





Summary comments on the strengths of species selection and its

interaction with other macroevolutionary causes of change


Species selection, the Darwinian analog at this higher level, but by no means the only irreducible force of macroevolutionary change, differs from conven­tional natural selection at the organismic level both in character and in gen­eral strength. The major aspect of character — as I have emphasized through­out this chapter in stressing the non-fractality of hierarchical levels — lies in the potency of species selection for governing “what species do.” Species se­lection does not, and cannot, build the complex adaptive phenotypes of or­ganisms, but this common statement only recognizes the general nature of hi­erarchical organization and does not represent a fair criticism of the efficacy of species selection, despite the claims of Dawkins (1982) and others (see p. 711 for a discussion of this point).

The primary force of species selection lies in its power to promote trends within clades, and to regulate the waxing and waning of differential spe­cies diversity within and among clades through time. The influence of species selection upon trends will also be enhanced because this process not only builds trends in species-level characters directly, but also establishes corre­lated trends in any character of the organismal phenotype that either helps to determine the species-level property, or merely hitchhikes upon the trend by linkages of homology within the phylogenetic structure of evolutionary trees — a very common phenomenon, as Raup and Gould, 1974, showed in theory and practice. This insight about trends, which I shall explore more thoroughly in the next chapter (pp. 886–893), may provide a key for explain­ing one of the most puzzling phenomena in paleontology — persistent and pervasive cladal trends (such as decreasing stipe number in graptolites, or in­creasing symmetry of crinoidal cups) that have defied all attempts at explana­tion in traditional terms of biomechanical advantages to organisms.

As for general strength, species selection (in primary comparison with the traditional level of Darwinian natural selection on organisms) includes certain features that diminish its influence, and others that enhance its power. Among factors that weaken the potential of species selection, we may men­tion:

(1) The generally low population size of species in clades, and the generally long life of species-individuals, both factors limiting the amount of variation usually available for a process of selection.

(2) Unlike the organism, the species-individual does not actively suppress selection at lower levels within itself. Since the individuals of lower levels, by their shorter cycle times, present much more variation for selection (per given unit of time), this unsuppressed lower-level selection may overwhelm the op­eration of species selection.

(3) Species selection, as the analog of asexual reproduction at the organismal level, becomes subject to the same important limit that favorable traits arising in one individual cannot be transferred laterally (for mixing and matching) to other individuals, but only vertically to direct descendants.

(4) Species selection is limited by particular structural constraints, encountered only at this higher level, most notably the apparently unbreakable correlation between origination and extinction rates, thus tying together by negative interaction the very two phenomena that, if positively associated — that is, high speciation with low extinction — could so powerfully accelerate any trend produced by species selection.

But several features that grant potential strength to species selection will counteract these negative forces and limits:

(1) Species selection may be theoretically weak relative to the power of transformation by continuous selection of lower-level individuals (organisms in this case) within species. But, in fact, such transformation by anagenesis rarely occurs in nature, as the great majority of species exhibit stasis during their geological lifetimes. With general anagenesis usually weak or inopera­tive, and with effective organismal selection concentrated at the origin of new species and their differentia (and thus also limited to the cycle time of species themselves), species selection can become a predominant process.

(2) The population size of species in clades may be low, but each event of speciation must produce difference from parental traits (at least enough to yield reproductive isolation) — whereas events of organismal birth need not add any new variation to the population. The amount of change per speciational event may be large, even providing a potential macroevolutionary ana­log to macromutation. (At such a point, however, we must also allow some possible weakening of selection's power as well, for macromutation, by pro­ducing a completed form of change in one step, deprives selection of its cre­ative role in building adaptation gradually — see Chapter 2.)

(3) At the species level, not only does each birth of a new individual include novel variation that may be substantial, but the variation also arises in an adaptive context (whereas mutation, the source of variation at the organismic level, will usually be detrimental to the organism). Of course, the adaptive component in the production of a new species-individual need only exist at the level of its own causal origin — often the organismal level, rather than the species level itself. But the new variation will often be adaptive at the species level for two reasons: first, because species-level rather than organismic pro­cesses often underlie the genesis of the variation; and second, because var­iation caused at the organismic level will often be synergistic with species advantages, whereas mutational variation rarely enjoys synergism with the benefits of organisms.

(4) The common synergism of organismal with species advantages pro­duces a powerful acceleration of macroevolution (Gould and Lloyd, 1999). Drives of directional speciation (often based on organismal adaptation) fre­quently foster species selection along the same pathway by accelerating the speciation rate or, perhaps more commonly, by enhancing the longevity of species arising in the direction of the drive. On the other hand, when or­ganismal selection runs counter to the interests of species, negative species se­lection may provide the only effective higher-level force that can act as a gov­ernor to slow or stymie the trend — probably a common feature in phylogeny, and previously given (in textbooks of my student days, but now rarely used) the unfelicitous and unfortunate name of “overspecialization.”

As a final point and guide to understanding the essential role of the species-individual in macroevolution, we must remind ourselves of the highly un­usual character of the individual conventionally (and usually unthinkingly) taken as a paradigm for all evolutionary causality — the organism. If we view evolutionary change as tripartite in causal nature — with drive, selection, and drift as the three major modes — then we may say that the organism allows se­lection to reign nearly supreme by “clearing out” the surrounding space of the other two processes. Drives do not seem important at the organismal level, because drives emerge from below, and organisms, as repeatedly em­phasized in this chapter, work so effectively as suppressors of lower-level se­lection. At the same time, drift produces limited impact at the organismal level because population sizes tend to be too large in most circumstances, and because the high degree of functional integration within organisms grants a selective significance to nearly every part, thus lowering the relative frequency of substantial neutrality in potential sites for drift. Therefore, selection based on organismal properties reigns at this canonical level — thus engendering the two great parochial prejudices of the strict Darwinian world view: the adaptationist program as a guide to nearly all evolutionary phenomena, and the virtual restriction of causality to natural selection working at the single level of organisms (two of the three legs of Darwin's tripod in the terms of this book).

But when we turn to the species level, we find an interesting partnership among the three causal forces of drive, selection and drift. Selection at the species level does not “clear out” these surrounding forces. Drives from be­low exert great influence in the phenomenon of directional speciation. Drift maintains similar impact in both its major manifestations: as species drift for the transformation of collectivities (clades); and as founder drift in differen­tial proliferation or reduction of subclades by accidents of propitious or limit­ing colonization. This absence of “clearing out” denotes no failure or weakness of selection at the species level, but should rather be viewed as a different “strategy” for the distinct and effective world of macroevolution. Higher-level selection does not bestride this larger world like the colossus of its ana­log at the organismal level. But higher-level selection gains a different kind of strength and interest in its fascinating and fruitful synergism (and opposition) with drives from below and with drift in the collegiality of its own domain.
