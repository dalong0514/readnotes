The man who has ceased to learn ought not to be allowed to wander around Ioose in these dangerous days.

### 1. Audience

This book and interactive CD-ROM is intended for use as both an undergrad-uate-level and a graduate-level text in chemical reaction engineering. The level will depend on the choice of chapters and CD-ROM Prufessionaf R@ference Shelf (PRS) material to be covered and the type and degree of difficulty of problems assigned.

### 2. The Goals

2.1. To Develop a Fundamental Understanding of Reaction Engineering

The first goal of this book is to enable the reader to develop a clear understanding of the fundamentals of chemical reaction engineering (CRE). This goal will be achieved by presenting a structure that allows the reader to solve reaction engineering problems through reasoning rather than through memorization and recall of numerous equations and the restrictions and conditions under which each equation applies. 

The algorithms presented in the text for reactor design provide this framework, and the homework problems will give practice at using the algorithms. The conventional home problems at the end of each chapter are designed to reinforce the principles in the chapter. 

These problems are about equally divided between those that can be solved with a calculator and those that require a personal computer and a numerical snftware package such as Polymath, MATLAB, or FEMLAB.

To give a reference point as to the level of understanding of CRE required in the profession. a number of reaction engineering problems from the California Board of Registration for Civil and Professional Engineers Chemcical Engineering Examinations (PECEE) are included in the text. 1 Typically, these problems should each require approximately 30 minutes to solve.

Finally, the CD-ROM should greatly facilitate learning the fundamentals of CRE because it includes summary notes of the chapters, added examples, expanded derivations, and self tests. A complete description of these learning resources is given in the "The Integration of the Text and the CD-ROM" section in this Preface.

2.2. To Develop Critical Thinking Skills

A second goal is to enhance critical thinking skills. A number of home problems have been included that are designed for this purpose. 

Socratic questioning is at the heart of critical thinking, and a number of homework problems draw from R. W.Paul's six types of Sacsatic questions2shown inTable P-I.

Scheffes and RubenfeId1'lexpand nn the practice of cntical thinking skill, dis- cussed by R. W. Paul by using the activities. statements, and question5 shown in Table P-2.




I have found the best way so develop and practice critical thinking akills is to use Tdbles P-I and P-2 to help students write a question on any assigtled home- work problem and then to explain why the question involves critical thinking.

More information on critical thinking can be found on the CD-ROM in the section on ProbI~rnSolving.
8.3. To Develop Creative Thinking Skills
The third goal of this book is to help deveIop creative thinking skills. This goal will be achieved by using a number of probiems that are open-ended to various degrees. Here the students can practice their creative skills by exploring the example problems as outlined at the beginning of the home problems of each chapter and by making up and solving an original problem. Problem P4-I gives some guidelines for developing original problems. A number of tech- niques that can aid the sntdents in practicing and enhancing their creativity can be found in FogIer and CeBlanc5and in the Thoughts on Problem Solving sec- tion on the CD-ROM and on the web site wwu:engifiumich.edu/-ere. We will use these techniques, such as Osborn's checklist and de Bono's lateral thinking (which involves considering other people's views and responding to random stimulation) to answer add-on questions such as those in Table P-3.


One of the major goals at the undergraduate level is to bring students to the point where they can solve complex reaction problems, such as multiple r a c - tions with heat effects, and then ask "What if...*'questions and look for opti- mum operating conditions. One problem whose solution exemplifies this goal is the Manufacture of Styrene, Problem P8-26. This problem is panicuIarly interesting because twa reactions are endothermic and one is exothermic.


o summarize Section B. it is the author's experience that both critical and cse- ative thinking skills can be enhanced by using Tables P-I, P-2. and P-3 to extend any of the homework problems at the end of every chapter.
C. The Structure
The strategy behind the presentation of materia1 is to build continually on a few basic ideas in chemical reaction engineering to solve a wide variety of prob- lems. These ideas. referred to as rhe PiIlacr ~;lf Clze~nicalR~actionEngineeri~lg.

are the foundation on which different applications rest. The pillars holding up
the application of chemical reaction engineering are shown in Figure P- I .



From there Pillars we construct our CRE algorithm:
M o l e balance + Rate laws + Stoichiornetry + Energy balance + Combine
With a few restrictions, the contents of this book can be studied in virtu- ally any order after students have mastered the first four chapters. A flow dia- gram showing the possible paths can be seen in Figure P-2.



Table P-4 shows examples of topics that ran be covered in n graduate course and an undergradua~ecourse, In a four-hour undergraduate course at [he University of Michigan. approximately eight chapters are covered in the fol- lowing order: Chapter? 1, 2, 3. 4, and 6; Sections 5.1-5.3; and Chapters 7. 8, and parts of Chapter 10.


The reader will observe that although metric units are used primarily in this text (e.g., kmoVm3,Jlmol), a variety of other units arealso employed (e.g.. Ib/ft3). This is intentional! We believe that whereas most papers published today use the metric system, a significant amount of reaction engineering data exists in the older literature in English units. Because engineers will be faced with extracting information and reaction rate data from older literature as well as the current literature, they should be equally at ease with both English and metric units.
The notes in the margins are meant to serve two purposes. First, they act as guides or as commentary as one reads through the material. Second, they identify key equations and relationships that are used to solve chemical reac- tion engineering problems.
D. The Components of the CD-ROM
The interactive CD-ROM is a novel and unique part of this book. The main purposes of the CD-ROM are to serve as an enrichment resource and as a pro- fessional reference shelf. The home page for the CD-ROM and the CRE web site (www.engin.umich.edu/-cre/fogler&gl4nen) is shown in Figure P-3.

The objectives of the CD-ROM are threefold: ( I) to facilitate the learning of CRE by interactive1y addressing the Feld~r/SolornonInventory nf Learning Sglesh in the Summary Notes. the additional examples, the Interactive Com- puting Modules (ICMs), and the Web ,Modules; (2) to provide additional tech- nical material for the professional reference sheIf; (3)to provide other tutorial information, examples, derivations, and self tests, such as additionai thoughts or1 probtem solving, the use of computational software in chemical reaction engineering, and representative course structures. The following components are listed at the end of masr chapters and can be accessed from each chapter in the CD-ROM.


E The Web
The web site (wu,\r:er?gh.~~tnicI~.e~Ett/w-cilrle)be used to updare the text and the CD-ROM. It will ~dentifytypographical and other errors In the hrst and later printings of the fourth edition of the text. In the near future. additional matenal will be added to include more solved probIem5 as well as additiana1 Web Modules.
G. What's New
Pedagogy. The fourth edition of this book maintains all the strengths of the previous additions by using algorithms that allow students to Iearn chemical reaction engineering throueh logic rather than memorization. At the same time it provides new resources that allow students to go beyond solving equations in order to get an intuitive feel and understanding of how reactors behave under different situations. This understanding is achieved through more than sixty interactive simulations provided an the CD-ROM that is shrink wrapped with the text. The CD-ROM has been greatly expanded to address the Fttlder/SoIornon Inventory of Different Learning Styles7 throush interactive Summary Notes and new and updated Interactive Computer Modules (ICMs). For example, the Global Learner can get an overview of the chanter material from the Summary Notes: the Sequential Learner can use all the
hot buttons: and the Active h earner can interact with the ICM's arid use the hot buttons in the Summazy Notes.
~i new pedagogical concept is introduced in this edition through expanded emphasis on the example problems. Here, the students simply load the Living Example Problems (LEPs) onto their computers and then explore the problems to obtain a deeper understanding of the implications and general- izations before working the home problems for that chapter. This exploration helps the srudents get an innate feel of reactor behavior and operation, as well asdevelop and practice their creative thinking skills. To develop critical think- ing skills, instructors can assign one of the new home problems on trouble- shooting, as weIl as ask the students to expand home problems by ashrig a reIated question that involves critical thinking using Tables P-1and P-2. Creative thinking skills can be enhanced by exproring the example: problems and asking "what if. . ." questions, by using one or more of the brainstorming exercises in Table P-3 to extend any of the home problems, and by working the open-ended problems. For example,.in the case study on safety, studtats can use the CD-ROM to c m y out a post-mortem on the nitroanaline explosiod in Example 9-2 to learn what would have happened if the cooling had failed for five minutes instead of ten minutes. Significant effort has been devoted to developing example and home probIems that foster critical and creative thinking.
