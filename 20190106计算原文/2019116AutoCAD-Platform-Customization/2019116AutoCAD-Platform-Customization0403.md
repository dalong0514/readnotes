# 0401. Bonus Chapter 3: Development Resources

## 1.1 Resources

This book helps you build a solid foundation in customizing and programming the Autodesk® AutoCAD ® program, but it can’t teach you everything. A wide range of resources are available to help you continue learning and expand your skills further. This appendix connects you with online and training resources, peer-to-peer forums, and additional files available for this book from the companion website.

### 1.1.1 Online Resources

Although the Internet existed when I first started customizing and programming AutoCAD back in 1996, there weren’t nearly as many resources available as there are today. You can now access a wide range of resources to learn about customization and programming features supported by AutoCAD. Along with the learning resources on the Internet, you can also access peer-to-peer sites; ask a question and get a response to your question.

#### Locating AutoCAD Customization and Programming Resources

Very little was known about the Internet more than two decades ago, but the same can’t be said today. The Internet has affected our everyday lives and the way we consume and deliver content, such as cute kitty videos, articles dedicated to making daily life easier, and AutoCAD-related resources. AutoCAD-related resources range from the Autodesk website to private blogs. Another great resource on the Internet is peer-to-peer forums, which I’ll discuss in the next section.

Table BC3.1 lists some of the resources that you can use to learn more about AutoCAD customization, such as creating script files or customizing the user interface.

Weblogs—or blogs, as they are more commonly called—are information websites published on the Internet, typically authored by one individual, and usually providing information from that author’s perspective. Articles published on a blog often have a social component that allows for discussions or comments between the author of an article and those who visit the blog. Many AutoCAD-related blogs can be found on the Internet, but only a small number are dedicated to customization and programming. Table BC3.4 includes a link to my blog and some blogs that I have found useful over the years.

Getting Help from Other Users

Peer-to-peer forums are sites where users openly participate to support fellow users. Questions posted on a peer-to-peer site are answered by other users in many cases, but you can also fi nd Autodesk employees answering questions on peer-to-peer sites. Table BC3.5 lists a few of the popular peer-to-peer sites for AutoCAD users. TRAINING RESOURCES AND EVENTS

AUGI (Autodesk User Group International) is a peer-to-peer site that supports users of all Autodesk products with magazine articles, tutorials, and more, including peer-to-peer forums. Customization and programming topics can be found under the Programming section.

The Autodesk Forums website allows you to ask questions about AutoCAD and other Autodesk products. Click the Forums link to access a list of products and a link titled AutoCAD Customization for topics related to customization and programming.

Th is site provides hundreds of tutorials and articles in addition to forums. Use the AutoCAD Customization section to engage in topics on customization and programming.

Peer-to-peer forums that are traveled by many AutoLISP programmers of all skill levels. The forums also cover all of the other APIs that AutoCAD supports along with a number of other programming-related forums.

NOTE

Ninety percent of all users on a peer-to-peer site are typically referred to as lurkers. A lurker is someone who just consumes or views content without participating in any discussion on a site. I encourage you to contribute to conversations when you have information or experience that adds value to the discussion; it is the only way peer-to-peer sites work.

Training Resources and Events

Attending online and local training sessions, and even industry events, can help you expand your knowledge and introduce you to individuals who are trying to solve similar problems.

Learning from Resellers, ATCs, and Colleges

Instructor-led sessions can provide huge benefits, from expanding skills to being introduced to new ways of approaching everyday problems. There are a number of resources that you might have access to in your local area that can help refine what you learn in this book and even help you excel further. Keep in mind that skills such as AutoLISP and VBA programming can be improved by learning about logic and flow charting and general programming concepts. 6

BONUS CHAPTER 3

DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES

A local Autodesk reseller, whether or not it is the one your company normally works with, may offer training that focuses on AutoCAD customization and programming. If they don’t, they might know a consultant in your local area who does offer the type of sessions you are looking for. The Autodesk website offers a searchable database to help you locate a local reseller. Check out www.autodesk.com/resellers.

Autodesk Training Centers—also known as ATCs—are another great way to get hands-on training in an instructor-led environment. An ATC is an educational institution or private company that offers training that meets or exceeds the standards established by Autodesk. The Autodesk website offers a searchable database of ATCs at www.autodesk.com/atc.

Colleges and universities play an important part in training the next generation of engineers and designers and provide sessions for veteran AutoCAD users who are looking to get more from their software. You will want to contact your local university to see if they offer any sessions that are specific to AutoCAD customization and programming. Even general programming sessions can be useful. If you can’t find the time to attend a class in person, consider attending a virtual course. A great friend of mine and one of the technical editors for this book, Craig Black, is an instructor at Fox Valley Technical College ((www.fvtc.edu). He is the lead instructor of an online AutoLISP/Visual LISP session through the technical college. I have known Craig for 18+ years, and he helped reinforce what I taught myself about AutoLISP.

Learning from Individuals with Similar Interests

Local user groups—also known as LUGs—consist of members who are in the same or similar industries. Some LUGs meet virtually and others meet locally. A LUG can be a great place to locate an individual in your local geographic area who might be willing to be a mentor or help answer questions on AutoCAD customization and programming. You can learn about the LUGs in your area by going to www.augi.com/user-groups/local.

In addition to LUGs, industry events are often a great way to network with other AutoCAD users and attend sessions that can’t be found anywhere else. The primary annual Autodesk event for users is Autodesk University, and for the last decade it has been primarily held in Las Vegas, Nevada. Autodesk University is a three-day event packed full of lectures, hands-on labs, industry speakers, and much more.

In addition to the event in Las Vegas, there are also small Autodesk University events that occur around the world; these are between one and two days in length. I have been privileged to present sessions on basic AutoCAD customization, AutoLISP, VBA, and even more advanced programming technologies such as .NET and ObjectARXX ® at Autodesk University for more than 10 years. At au.autodesk.com you can learn about upcoming Autodesk University events and past sessions presented by industry experts.

Accessing and Using the Companion Website

The AutoCAD Customization Platform: User Interface, AutoLISP, VBA, and Beyond companion website contains all of the sample and project files used for the exercises throughout the book. In addition to the files referenced in the exercises, there are bonus chapters that include information on working with complex 2D objects and the basics of 3D with VBA and the AutoCAD Object library. ACCESSING AND USING THE COMPANION WEBSITE

The companion website is located here:

www.sybex.com/go/autocadcustomization

Downloading the Sample Files

The sample files on the companion website are stored in zip files. Zip files make it easy to download multiple files at a time. To access the files in a zip file, you will need to download it to your local drive and then extract its files. The exercises in this book assume that all files are extracted to the MyCustomFiles folder within the Documents (or My Documents) folder.

The following steps explain how to download and extract the sample files:

1. Navigate to the companion website.

2. Click the link that references the zip file to download.

3. Based on the browser you are using, click Save or Save As.

4. Navigate to the MyCustomFiles folder on your computer and save the file to that folder or whatever other folder you choose.

5. When the download completes, right-click the zip file, choose Extract All, and follow the instructions on the screen.

NOTE

See the front of the book for instructions on setting up the MyCustomFiles folder.

What’s on the Website

The following list provides an overview of the files that are located on the companion website:

Sample and Completed Project Files The files you will need to complete the exercises are stored in zip files that are named by chapter. For example, the sample files for Chapter 4 are available in the file named c04_sample_files.zip. Some exercises are dependent on earlier exercises; in those cases a sample file is created for you to start from. For example, in one of the exercises in the book you create a LSP file named drawplate.lsp. If you didn’t create that file but are trying to complete the exercise in Chapter 15, you could start with the file named ch15_drawplate.lsp. When writing code at times, not everything might go as planned, and for that reason the completed solutions of many exercises are also included. For example, part of the completed solution for the exercise in Chapter 15 can be found in the file named ch15_ drawplate_complete.lsp.

Bonus Chapters Due to space constraints and the desire to provide as much information as possible, some content is presented in bonus chapters that can be accessed from the companion website. Table BC3.6 lists these additional chapters. 8
