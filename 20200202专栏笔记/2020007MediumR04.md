### 0101. 术语卡——The Event Loop

And what are these Web APIs? In essence, they are threads that you can’t access, you can just make calls to them. They are the pieces of the browser in which concurrency kicks in. If you’re a Node.js developer, these are the C++ APIs. So what is the event loop after all?

The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, it will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop. Each event is just a function callback.

How JavaScript works: an overview of the engine, the runtime, and the call stack.

This post is meant to be the first in a series aimed at digging deeper into JavaScript and how it actually works: we thought that by knowing the building blocks of JavaScript and how they come to play together, you’ll be able to write better code and apps. We’ll also share some rules of thumb we use when building SessionStack ([Co-browsing, live and recorded sessions for support teams | SessionStack](https://www.sessionstack.com/?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=source&utm_content=javascript-series-post1-intro)), a lightweight JavaScript application that has to be robust and highly-performant in order to stay competitive.

If projects are getting so much dependent on JavaScript, this means that developers have to be utilizing everything that the language and the ecosystem provide with deeper and deeper understanding of the internals, in order to build amazing software. As it turns out, there are a lot of developers that are using JavaScript on a daily basis but don’t have the knowledge of what happens under the hood.

### 01. Overview

Almost everyone has already heard of the V8 Engine as a concept, and most people know that JavaScript is single-threaded or that it is using a callback queue. In this post, we’ll go through all these concepts in detail and explain how JavaScript actually runs. By knowing these details, you’ll be able to write better, non-blocking apps that are properly leveraging the provided APIs. If you’re relatively new to JavaScript, this blog post will help you understand why JavaScript is so “weird” compared to other languages. And if you’re an experienced JavaScript developer, hopefully, it will give you some fresh insights on how the JavaScript Runtime you’re using every day actually works.

1『JavaScript is single-threaded or that it is using a callback queue. JS 是单线程的，使用「callback queue」。』

### 02. The JavaScript Engine

A popular example of a JavaScript Engine is Google’s V8 engine. The V8 engine is used inside Chrome and Node.js for example. Here is a very simplified view of what it looks like. The Engine consists of two main components: 1) Memory Heap — this is where the memory allocation happens. 2) Call Stack — this is where your stack frames are as your code executes.

1『原文中的图很赞。』

### 03. The Runtime

There are APIs in the browser that have been used by almost any JavaScript developer out there (e.g. “setTimeout”). Those APIs, however, are not provided by the Engine. So, where are they coming from? It turns out that the reality is a bit more complicated. So, we have the Engine but there is actually a lot more. We have those things called Web APIs which are provided by browsers, like the DOM, AJAX, setTimeout and much more. And then, we have the so popular event loop and the callback queue.

2『原文中的图去反复看。』

### 04. The Call Stack

JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language, which means it has a single Call Stack. Therefore it can do one thing at a time. The Call Stack is a data structure which records basically where in the program we are. If we step into a function, we put it on the top of the stack. If we return from a function, we pop off the top of the stack. That’s all the stack can do. Let’s see an example. Take a look at the following code:

```js
function multiply(x, y) {
    return x * y;
}
function printSquare(x) {
    var s = multiply(x, x);
    console.log(s);
}
printSquare(5);
```

When the engine starts executing this code, the Call Stack will be empty. Afterwards, the steps will be the following:

Each entry in the Call Stack is called a Stack Frame. And this is exactly how stack traces are being constructed when an exception is being thrown — it is basically the state of the Call Stack when the exception happened. Take a look at the following code:

1『原文图里一个个矩形方块是 Call Stack，Call Stack 里要执行的语句是 Stack Frame。』

```js
function foo() {
    throw new Error('SessionStack will help you resolve crashes :)');
}
function bar() {
    foo();
}
function start() {
    bar();
}
start();
```

If this is executed in Chrome (assuming that this code is in a file called foo.js), the following stack trace will be produced:

“Blowing the stack” — this happens when you reach the maximum Call Stack size. And that could happen quite easily, especially if you’re using recursion without testing your code very extensively. Take a look at this sample code:

```js
function foo() {
    foo();
}
foo();
```

When the engine starts executing this code, it starts with calling the function “foo”. This function, however, is recursive and starts calling itself without any termination conditions. So at every step of the execution, the same function gets added to the Call Stack over and over again. It looks something like this:

1『原文中图很形象。』

At some point, however, the number of function calls in the Call Stack exceeds the actual size of the Call Stack, and the browser decides to take action, by throwing an error, which can look something like this:

Running code on a single thread can be quite easy since you don’t have to deal with complicated scenarios that are arising in multi-threaded environments — for example, deadlocks. But running on a single thread is quite limiting as well. Since JavaScript has a single Call Stack, what happens when things are slow?

### Concurrency & the Event Loop

What happens when you have function calls in the Call Stack that take a huge amount of time in order to be processed? For example, imagine that you want to do some complex image transformation with JavaScript in the browser. You may ask — why is this even a problem? The problem is that while the Call Stack has functions to execute, the browser can’t actually do anything else — it’s getting blocked. This means that the browser can’t render, it can’t run any other code, it’s just stuck. And this creates problems if you want nice fluid UIs in your app.

And that’s not the only problem. Once your browser starts processing so many tasks in the Call Stack, it may stop being responsive for quite a long time. And most browsers take action by raising an error, asking you whether you want to terminate the web page. Now, that’s not the best user experience out there, is it? 

So, how can we execute heavy code without blocking the UI and making the browser unresponsive? Well, the solution is asynchronous callbacks. This will be explained in greater detail in Part 2 of the “How JavaScript actually works” tutorial: “Inside the V8 engine + 5 tips on how to write optimized code”.

In the meantime, if you’re having a hard time reproducing and understanding issues in your JavaScript apps, take a look at SessionStack. SessionStack records everything in your web apps: all DOM changes, user interactions, JavaScript exceptions, stack traces, failed network requests, and debug messages. With SessionStack, you can replay issues in your web apps as videos and see everything that happened to your user. There’s a free plan, no credit card is required. Get started now.

How JavaScript works: inside the V8 engine + 5 tips on how to write optimized code.

Couple of weeks ago we started a series aimed at digging deeper into JavaScript and how it actually works: we thought that by knowing the building blocks of JavaScript and how they come to play together you’ll be able to write better code and apps.

The first post of the series focused on providing an overview of the engine, the runtime and the call stack. This second post will be diving into the internal parts of Google’s V8 JavaScript engine. We’ll also provide a few quick tips on how to write better JavaScript code —best practices our development team at SessionStack follows when building the product.

### 01. Overview

A JavaScript engine is a program or an interpreter which executes JavaScript code. A JavaScript engine can be implemented as a standard interpreter, or just-in-time compiler that compiles JavaScript to bytecode in some form. 

This is a list of popular projects that are implementing a JavaScript engine: 1) V8 — open source, developed by Google, written in C++. 2) Rhino — managed by the Mozilla Foundation, open source, developed entirely in Java. 3) SpiderMonkey — the first JavaScript engine, which back in the days powered Netscape Navigator, and today powers Firefox. 4) JavaScriptCore — open source, marketed as Nitro and developed by Apple for Safari. 5) KJS — KDE’s engine originally developed by Harri Porten for the KDE project’s Konqueror web browser. 6) Chakra (JScript9) — Internet Explorer. 7) Chakra (JavaScript) — Microsoft Edge. 8) Nashorn, open source as part of OpenJDK, written by Oracle Java Languages and Tool Group. 9) JerryScript — is a lightweight engine for the Internet of Things.

### 02. Why was the V8 Engine created?

The V8 Engine which is built by Google is open source and written in C++. This engine is used inside Google Chrome. Unlike the rest of the engines, however, V8 is also used for the popular Node.js runtime.

V8 was first designed to increase the performance of JavaScript execution inside web browsers. In order to obtain speed, V8 translates JavaScript code into more efficient machine code instead of using an interpreter. It compiles JavaScript code into machine code at execution by implementing a JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler like a lot of modern JavaScript engines do such as SpiderMonkey or Rhino (Mozilla). The main difference here is that V8 doesn’t produce bytecode or any intermediate code.

### 03. V8 used to have two compilers

Before version 5.9 of V8 came out (released earlier this year), the engine used two compilers: 1) full-codegen — a simple and very fast compiler that produced simple and relatively slow machine code. 2) Crankshaft — a more complex (Just-In-Time) optimizing compiler that produced highly-optimized code.

The V8 Engine also uses several threads internally: 1) The main thread does what you would expect: fetch your code, compile it and then execute it. 2) There’s also a separate thread for compiling, so that the main thread can keep executing while the former is optimizing the code. 3) A Profiler thread that will tell the runtime on which methods we spend a lot of time so that Crankshaft can optimize them. 4) A few threads to handle Garbage Collector sweeps.

When first executing the JavaScript code, V8 leverages full-codegen which directly translates the parsed JavaScript into machine code without any transformation. This allows it to start executing machine code very fast. Note that V8 does not use intermediate bytecode representation this way removing the need for an interpreter.

When your code has run for some time, the profiler thread has gathered enough data to tell which method should be optimized.

Next, Crankshaft optimizations begin in another thread. It translates the JavaScript abstract syntax tree to a high-level static single-assignment (SSA) representation called Hydrogen and tries to optimize that Hydrogen graph. Most optimizations are done at this level.

### 04. Inlining

The first optimization is inlining as much code as possible in advance. Inlining is the process of replacing a call site (the line of code where the function is called) with the body of the called function. This simple step allows following optimizations to be more meaningful.

1『没弄清楚 Inlining 的概念，即使原文中有张图。』

### 05. Hidden class

JavaScript is a prototype-based language: there are no classes and objects are created using a cloning process. JavaScript is also a dynamic programming language which means that properties can be easily added or removed from an object after its instantiation.

Most JavaScript interpreters use dictionary-like structures (hash function based) to store the location of object property values in the memory. This structure makes retrieving the value of a property in JavaScript more computationally expensive than it would be in a non-dynamic programming language like Java or C#. In Java, all of the object properties are determined by a fixed object layout before compilation and cannot be dynamically added or removed at runtime (well, C# has the dynamic type which is another topic). As a result, the values of properties (or pointers to those properties) can be stored as a continuous buffer in the memory with a fixed-offset between each. The length of an offset can easily be determined based on the property type, whereas this is not possible in JavaScript where a property type can change during runtime.

1『 Java 在检索键-值型数据结构（对象）时比 JS 高效。』

Since using dictionaries to find the location of object properties in the memory is very inefficient, V8 uses a different method instead: hidden classes. Hidden classes work similarly to the fixed object layouts (classes) used in languages like Java, except they are created at runtime. Now, let’s see what they actually look like:

```js
function Point(x, y) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
}
var p1 = new Point(1, 2);
```

Once the「new Point(1, 2)」invocation happens, V8 will create a hidden class called「C0」. No properties have been defined for Point yet, so「C0」is empty.

Once the first statement「this.x = x」is executed (inside the「Point」function), V8 will create a second hidden class called「C1」that is based on「C0」.「C1」describes the location in the memory (relative to the object pointer) where the property x can be found. In this case,「x」is stored at offset 0, which means that when viewing a point object in the memory as a continuous buffer, the first offset will correspond to property「x」. V8 will also update「C0」with a「class transition」which states that if a property「x」is added to a point object, the hidden class should switch from「C0」to「C1」. The hidden class for the point object below is now「C1」.

Every time a new property is added to an object, the old hidden class is updated with a transition path to the new hidden class. Hidden class transitions are important because they allow hidden classes to be shared among objects that are created the same way. If two objects share a hidden class and the same property is added to both of them, transitions will ensure that both objects receive the same new hidden class and all the optimized code that comes with it.

This process is repeated when the statement「this.y = y」is executed (again, inside the Point function, after the「this.x = x」statement). A new hidden class called「C2」is created, a class transition is added to「C1」stating that if a property「y」is added to a Point object (that already contains property「x」) then the hidden class should change to「C2」, and the point object’s hidden class is updated to「C2」.

Hidden class transitions are dependent on the order in which properties are added to an object. Take a look at the code snippet below:

```js
function Point(x, y) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
}

var p1 = new Point(1, 2);
p1.a = 5;
p1.b = 6;

var p2 = new Point(3, 4);
p2.b = 7;
p2.a = 8;
```

Now, you would assume that for both p1 and p2 the same hidden classes and transitions would be used. Well, not really. For「p1」, first the property「a」will be added and then the property「b」. For「p2」, however, first「b」is being assigned, followed by「a」. Thus,「p1」and「p2」end up with different hidden classes as a result of the different transition paths. In such cases, it’s much better to initialize dynamic properties in the same order so that the hidden classes can be reused.

1『结合原图中的图看要清楚很多。』

### 06. Inline caching

V8 takes advantage of another technique for optimizing dynamically typed languages called inline caching. Inline caching relies on the observation that repeated calls to the same method tend to occur on the same type of object. An in-depth explanation of inline caching can be found here. We’re going to touch upon the general concept of inline caching (in case you don’t have the time to go through the in-depth explanation above).

3『 [Optimizing dynamic JavaScript with inline caches · sq/JSIL Wiki](https://github.com/sq/JSIL/wiki/Optimizing-dynamic-JavaScript-with-inline-caches) 』

So how does it work? V8 maintains a cache of the type of objects that were passed as a parameter in recent method calls and uses this information to make an assumption about the type of object that will be passed as a parameter in the future. If V8 is able to make a good assumption about the type of object that will be passed to a method, it can bypass the process of figuring out how to access the object’s properties, and instead, use the stored information from previous lookups to the object’s hidden class.

So how are the concepts of hidden classes and inline caching related? Whenever a method is called on a specific object, the V8 engine has to perform a lookup to the hidden class of that object in order to determine the offset for accessing a specific property. After two successful calls of the same method to the same hidden class, V8 omits the hidden class lookup and simply adds the offset of the property to the object pointer itself. For all future calls of that method, the V8 engine assumes that the hidden class hasn’t changed, and jumps directly into the memory address for a specific property using the offsets stored from previous lookups. This greatly increases execution speed.

Inline caching is also the reason why it’s so important that objects of the same type share hidden classes. If you create two objects of the same type and with different hidden classes (as we did in the example earlier), V8 won’t be able to use inline caching because even though the two objects are of the same type, their corresponding hidden classes assign different offsets to their properties.

![](./res/2020017.png)

The two objects are basically the same but the「a」and「b」properties were created in different order.

### 07. Compilation to machine code

Once the Hydrogen graph is optimized, Crankshaft lowers it to a lower-level representation called Lithium. Most of the Lithium implementation is architecture-specific. Register allocation happens at this level.

In the end, Lithium is compiled into machine code. Then something else happens called OSR: on-stack replacement. Before we started compiling and optimizing an obviously long-running method, we were likely running it. V8 is not going to forget what it just slowly executed to start again with the optimized version. Instead, it will transform all the context we have (stack, registers) so that we can switch to the optimized version in the middle of the execution. This is a very complex task, having in mind that among other optimizations, V8 has inlined the code initially. V8 is not the only engine capable of doing it.

There are safeguards called deoptimization to make the opposite transformation and reverts back to the non-optimized code in case an assumption the engine made doesn’t hold true anymore.

### 08. Garbage collection

For garbage collection, V8 uses a traditional generational approach of mark-and-sweep to clean the old generation. The marking phase is supposed to stop the JavaScript execution. In order to control GC costs and make the execution more stable, V8 uses incremental marking: instead of walking the whole heap, trying to mark every possible object, it only walk part of the heap, then resumes normal execution. The next GC stop will continue from where the previous heap walk has stopped. This allows for very short pauses during the normal execution. As mentioned before, the sweep phase is handled by separate threads.

### 09. Ignition and TurboFan

With the release of V8 5.9 earlier in 2017, a new execution pipeline was introduced. This new pipeline achieves even bigger performance improvements and significant memory savings in real-world JavaScript applications. The new execution pipeline is built on top of Ignition, V8’s interpreter, and TurboFan, V8’s newest optimizing compiler. You can check out the blog post from the V8 team about the topic here.

Since version 5.9 of V8 came out, full-codegen and Crankshaft (the technologies that have served V8 since 2010) have no longer been used by V8 for JavaScript execution as the V8 team has struggled to keep pace with the new JavaScript language features and the optimizations needed for these features. This means that overall V8 will have much simpler and more maintainable architecture going forward.

Improvements on Web and Node.js benchmarks. These improvements are just the start. The new Ignition and TurboFan pipeline pave the way for further optimizations that will boost JavaScript performance and shrink V8’s footprint in both Chrome and Node.js in the coming years.  Finally, here are some tips and tricks on how to write well-optimized, better JavaScript. You can easily derive these from the content above, however, here’s a summary for your convenience:

### How to write optimized JavaScript

1. Order of object properties: always instantiate your object properties in the same order so that hidden classes, and subsequently optimized code, can be shared.

2. Dynamic properties: adding properties to an object after instantiation will force a hidden class change and slow down any methods that were optimized for the previous hidden class. Instead, assign all of an object’s properties in its constructor.

3. Methods: code that executes the same method repeatedly will run faster than code that executes many different methods only once (due to inline caching).

4. Arrays: avoid sparse arrays where keys are not incremental numbers. Sparse arrays which don’t have every element inside them are a hash table. Elements in such arrays are more expensive to access. Also, try to avoid pre-allocating large arrays. It’s better to grow as you go. Finally, don’t delete elements in arrays. It makes the keys sparse.

5. Tagged values: V8 represents objects and numbers with 32 bits. It uses a bit to know if it is an object (flag = 1) or an integer (flag = 0) called SMI (SMall Integer) because of its 31 bits. Then, if a numeric value is bigger than 31 bits, V8 will box the number, turning it into a double and creating a new object to put the number inside. Try to use 31 bit signed numbers whenever possible to avoid the expensive boxing operation into a JS object.

## 20200403memory-management-.md

In this third post, we’ll discuss another critical topic that’s getting ever more neglected by developers due to the increasing maturity and complexity of programming languages that are being used on a daily basis — memory management. We’ll also provide a few tips on how to handle memory leaks in JavaScript that we at SessionStack follow as we need to make sure SessionStack causes no memory leaks or doesn’t increase the memory consumption of the web app in which we are integrated.

### 01. Overview

Languages, like C, have low-level memory management primitives such as malloc() and free(). These primitives are used by the developer to explicitly allocate and free memory from and to the operating system.

At the same time, JavaScript allocates memory when things (objects, strings, etc.) are created and「automatically」frees it up when they are not used anymore, a process called garbage collection. This seemingly「automatical」nature of freeing up resources is a source of confusion and gives JavaScript (and other high-level-language) developers the false impression they can choose not to care about memory management. This is a big mistake.

Even when working with high-level languages, developers should have an understanding of memory management (or at least the basics). Sometimes there are issues with the automatic memory management (such as bugs or implementation limitations in the garbage collectors, etc.) which developers have to understand in order to handle them properly (or to find a proper workaround, with a minimum trade off and code debt).

### 02. What is memory?

Before jumping straight to memory in JavaScript, we’ll briefly discuss what memory is in general and how it works in a nutshell.

On a hardware level, computer memory consists of a large number of flip flops. Each flip flop contains a few transistors and is capable of storing one bit. Individual flip flops are addressable by a unique identifier, so we can read and overwrite them. Thus, conceptually, we can think of our entire computer memory as a just one giant array of bits that we can read and write.

Since as humans, we are not that good at doing all of our thinking and arithmetic in bits, we organize them into larger groups, which together can be used to represent numbers. 8 bits are called 1 byte. Beyond bytes, there are words (which are sometimes 16, sometimes 32 bits).

A lot of things are stored in this memory: 1) All variables and other data used by all programs. 2) The programs’ code, including the operating system’s.

The compiler and the operating system work together to take care of most of the memory management for you, but we recommend that you take a look at what’s going on under the hood.

When you compile your code, the compiler can examine primitive data types and calculate ahead of time how much memory they will need. The required amount is then allocated to the program in the call stack space. The space in which these variables are allocated is called the stack space because as functions get called, their memory gets added on top of the existing memory. As they terminate, they are removed in a LIFO (last-in, first-out) order. For example, consider the following declarations:

```js
int n; // 4 bytes
int x[4]; // array of 4 elements, each 4 bytes
double m; // 8 bytes
```

The compiler can immediately see that the code requires 4 + 4 × 4 + 8 = 28 bytes. That’s how it works with the current sizes for integers and doubles. About 20 years ago, integers were typically 2 bytes, and double 4 bytes. Your code should never have to depend on what is at this moment the size of the basic data types.

The compiler will insert code that will interact with the operating system to request the necessary number of bytes on the stack for your variables to be stored. In the example above, the compiler knows the exact memory address of each variable. In fact, whenever we write to the variable n, this gets translated into something like「memory address 4127963」internally.

Notice that if we attempted to access x[4] here, we would have accessed the data associated with m . That’s because we’re accessing an element in the array that doesn’t exist — it’s 4 bytes further than the last actual allocated element in the array which is x[3], and may end up reading (or overwriting) some of m’s bits. This would almost certainly have very undesired consequences for the rest of the program.

1『 x[4] 是第 5 个元素，超出了之前分配给数组的内存地址了，内存地址 m 不知道存的是啥。』

When functions call other functions, each gets its own chunk of the stack when it is called. It keeps all its local variables there, but also a program counter that remembers where in its execution it was. When the function finishes, its memory block is once again made available for other purposes.

### 03. Dynamic allocation

Unfortunately, things aren’t quite as easy when we don’t know at compile time how much memory a variable will need. Suppose we want to do something like the following:

```js
int n = readInput(); // reads input from the user
...
// create an array with "n" elements
```

Here, at compile time, the compiler does not know how much memory the array will need because it is determined by the value provided by the user.

It, therefore, cannot allocate room for a variable on the stack. Instead, our program needs to explicitly ask the operating system for the right amount of space at run-time. This memory is assigned from the heap space. The difference between static and dynamic memory allocation is summarized in the following table:

Static allocation: 1) Size must be known at compile time. 2) Performed at compile time. 3) Assigned to the stack. 4) FILO  (first-in, last-out). 

Dynamic allocation: 1) Size may be unknown at compile time. 2) Performed at run time. 3) Assigned to the heap. 4) No particular order of assignment.

To fully understand how dynamic memory allocation works, we need to spend more time on pointers, which might be a bit too much of a deviation from the topic of this post. If you’re interested in learning more, just let me know in the comments and we can go into more details about pointers in a future post.

### 04. Allocation in JavaScript

Now we’ll explain how the first step (allocate memory) works in JavaScript. JavaScript relieves developers from the responsibility to handle memory allocations — JavaScript does it by itself, alongside declaring values.

```js
var n = 374; // allocates memory for a number
var s = 'sessionstack'; // allocates memory for a string 

var o = {
  a: 1,
  b: null
}; // allocates memory for an object and its contained values

var a = [1, null, 'str'];  // (like object) allocates memory for the array and its contained values

function f(a) {
  return a + 3;
} // allocates a function (which is a callable object). function expressions also allocate an object

someElement.addEventListener('click', function() {
  someElement.style.backgroundColor = 'blue';
}, false);
```

Some function calls result in object allocation as well:

```js
var d = new Date(); // allocates a Date object
var e = document.createElement('div'); // allocates a DOM element
```

Methods can allocate new values or objects:

```js
var s1 = 'sessionstack';
var s2 = s1.substr(0, 3); // s2 is a new string
// Since strings are immutable, JavaScript may decide to not allocate memory, but just store the [0, 3] range.
var a1 = ['str1', 'str2'];
var a2 = ['str3', 'str4'];
var a3 = a1.concat(a2); 
// new array with 4 elements being the concatenation of a1 and a2 elements
```

### 05. Using memory in JavaScript

Using the allocated memory in JavaScript basically, means reading and writing in it. This can be done by reading or writing the value of a variable or an object property or even passing an argument to a function.

### 06. Release when the memory is not needed anymore

Most of the memory management issues come at this stage.

The hardest task here is to figure out when the allocated memory is not needed any longer. It often requires the developer to determine where in the program such piece of memory is not needed anymore and free it. High-level languages embed a piece of software called garbage collector which job is to track memory allocation and use in order to find when a piece of allocated memory is not needed any longer in which case, it will automatically free it. Unfortunately, this process is an approximation since the general problem of knowing whether some piece of memory is needed is undecidable (can’t be solved by an algorithm).

Most garbage collectors work by collecting memory which can no longer be accessed, e.g. all variables pointing to it went out of scope. That’s, however, an under-approximation of the set of memory spaces that can be collected, because at any point a memory location may still have a variable pointing to it in scope, yet it will never be accessed again.

### 07. Garbage collection

Due to the fact that finding whether some memory is「not needed anymore」is undecidable, garbage collections implement a restriction of a solution to the general problem. This section will explain the necessary notions to understand the main garbage collection algorithms and their limitations.

### 08. Memory references

The main concept garbage collection algorithms rely on is the one of reference. Within the context of memory management, an object is said to reference another object if the former has an access to the latter (can be implicit or explicit). For instance, a JavaScript object has a reference to its prototype (implicit reference) and to its properties’ values (explicit reference). 

In this context, the idea of an「object」is extended to something broader than regular JavaScript objects and also contains function scopes (or the global lexical scope). Lexical Scoping defines how variable names are resolved in nested functions: inner functions contain the scope of parent functions even if the parent function has returned.

### 09. Reference-counting garbage collection

This is the simplest garbage collection algorithm. An object is considered「garbage collectible」if there are zero references pointing to it. Take a look at the following code:

```js
var o1 = {
  o2: {
    x: 1
  }
};
// 2 objects are created. 'o2' is referenced by 'o1' object as one of its properties.
// None can be garbage-collected

var o3 = o1; // the 'o3' variable is the second thing that has a reference to the object pointed by 'o1'. 
                                                       
o1 = 1;      // now, the object that was originally in 'o1' has a single reference, embodied by the 'o3' variable

var o4 = o3.o2; // reference to 'o2' property of the object.
                // This object has now 2 references: one as a property. 
                // The other as the 'o4' variable

o3 = '374'; // The object that was originally in 'o1' has now zero references to it. 
            // It can be garbage-collected.
            // However, what was its 'o2' property is still
            // referenced by the 'o4' variable, so it cannot be freed.

o4 = null; // what was the 'o2' property of the object originally in
           // 'o1' has zero references to it. 
           // It can be garbage collected.
```

### 10. Cycles are creating problems

There is a limitation when it comes to cycles. In the following example, two objects are created and reference one another, thus creating a cycle. They will go out of scope after the function call, so they are effectively useless and could be freed. However, the reference-counting algorithm considers that since each of the two objects is referenced at least once, neither can be garbage-collected.

```js
function f() {
  var o1 = {};
  var o2 = {};
  o1.p = o2; // o1 references o2
  o2.p = o1; // o2 references o1. This creates a cycle.
}

f();
```

### 11. Mark-and-sweep algorithm

In order to decide whether an object is needed, this algorithm determines whether the object is reachable. The Mark-and-sweep algorithm goes through these 3 steps:

1. Roots: In general, roots are global variables which get referenced in the code. In JavaScript for example, a global variable that can act as a root is the「window」object. The identical object in Node.js is called「global」. A complete list of all roots gets built by the garbage collector.

2. The algorithm then inspects all roots and their children and marks them as active (meaning, they are not garbage). Anything that a root cannot reach will be marked as garbage.

3. Finally, the garbage collector frees all memory pieces that are not marked as active and returns that memory to the OS.

1『原文里有张动态图。』

This algorithm is better than the previous one since「an object has zero reference」leads to this object being unreachable. The opposite is not true as we have seen with cycles.

As of 2012, all modern browsers ship a mark-and-sweep garbage-collector. All improvements made in the field of JavaScript garbage collection (generational/incremental/concurrent/parallel garbage collection) over the last years are implementation improvements of this algorithm (mark-and-sweep), but not improvements over the garbage collection algorithm itself, nor its goal of deciding whether an object is reachable or not. In this article, you can read in a greater detail about tracing garbage collection that also covers mark-and-sweep along with its optimizations.

3『 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracing_garbage_collection 』

### 12. Cycles are not a problem anymore

In the first example above, after the function call returns, the two objects are not referenced anymore by something reachable from the global object. Consequently, they will be found unreachable by the garbage collector. Even though there are references between the objects, they’re not reachable from the root.

### 13. Counter intuitive behavior of Garbage Collectors

Although Garbage Collectors are convenient they come with their own set of trade-offs. One of them is non-determinism. In other words, GCs are unpredictable. You can’t really tell when a collection will be performed. This means that in some cases programs use more memory that it’s actually required. In other cases, short-pauses may be noticeable in particularly sensitive applications. Although non-determinism means one cannot be certain when a collection will be performed, most GC implementations share the common pattern of doing collection passes during allocation. 

If no allocations are performed, most GCs stay idle. Consider the following scenario: 1. A sizable set of allocations is performed. 2. Most of these elements (or all of them) are marked as unreachable (suppose we null a reference pointing to a cache we no longer need). 3. No further allocations are performed.

In this scenario, most GCs will not run any further collection passes. In other words, even though there are unreachable references available for collection, these are not claimed by the collector. These are not strictly leaks but still, result in higher-than-usual memory usage.

### 14. What are memory leaks?

Just like the memory suggests, memory leaks are pieces of memory that the application have used in the past but is not needed any longer but has not yet been return back to the OS or the pool of free memory.

Programming languages favor different ways of managing memory. However, whether a certain piece of memory is used or not is actually an undecidable problem. In other words, only developers can make it clear whether a piece of memory can be returned to the operating system or not.

Certain programming languages provide features that help developers do this. Others expect developers to be completely explicit about when a piece of memory is unused. Wikipedia has good articles on manual and automatic memory management.

3『 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_memory_management | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science) 』

### 15. The four types of common JavaScript leaks

#### 1. Global variables

JavaScript handles undeclared variables in an interesting way: when a undeclared variable is referenced, a new variable gets created in the global object. In a browser, the global object would be window, which means that: 

```js
function foo(arg) {
    bar = "some text";
}
```

is the equivalent of:

```js
function foo(arg) {
    window.bar = "some text";
}
```

Let’s say the purpose of bar is to only reference a variable in the foo function. A redundant global variable will be created, however, if you don’t use var to declare it. In the above case, this won’t cause much harm. You can surely imagine a more damaging scenario though.

You can also accidentally create a global variable using this:

```js
function foo() {
    this.var1 = "potential accidental global";
}
// Foo called on its own, this points to the global object (window)
// rather than being undefined.
foo();
```

1『函数对象以函数形式调用的话，this 指向了全局对象 window。但如果用严格模式的话，this 指向 undefined。』

You can avoid all this by adding ‘use strict’; at the beginning of your JavaScript file which would switch on a much stricter mode of parsing JavaScript which prevents the unexpected creation of global variables.

Unexpected globals is certainly an issue, however, more often than not your code would be infested with explicit global variables which by definition cannot be collected by the garbage collector. Special attention needs to be given to global variables used to temporarily store and process large bits of information. Use global variables to store data if you must but when you do, make sure to assign it as null or reassign it once you are done with it.

#### 2. Timers or callbacks that are forgotten

Let’s take setInterval for example as it’s often used in JavaScript.

Libraries which provide observers and other instruments that accept callbacks usually make sure all references to the callbacks become unreachable once their instances are unreachable too. Still, the code below is not a rare find:

```js
var serverData = loadData();
setInterval(function() {
    var renderer = document.getElementById('renderer');
    if(renderer) {
        renderer.innerHTML = JSON.stringify(serverData);
    }
}, 5000); //This will be executed every ~5 seconds.
```

The snippet above shows the consequences of using timers that reference nodes or data that’s no longer needed.

The renderer object may be replaced or removed at some point which would make the block encapsulated by the interval handler redundant. If this happens, neither the handler, nor its dependencies would be collected as the interval would need to be stopped first (remember, it’s still active). It all boils down to the fact that serverData which surely stores and processes loads of data will not be collected either.

When using observers, you need to make sure you make an explicit call to remove them once you are done with them (either the observer is not needed anymore, or the object will become unreachable).

Luckily, most modern browsers would do the job for you: they’ll automatically collect the observer handlers once the observed object becomes unreachable even if you forgot to remove the listener. In the past some browsers were unable to handle these cases (good old IE6).

Still, though, it’s in line with best practices to remove the observers once the object becomes obsolete. See the following example:

```js
var element = document.getElementById('launch-button');
var counter = 0;
function onClick(event) {
   counter++;
   element.innerHtml = 'text ' + counter;
}
element.addEventListener('click', onClick);
// Do stuff
element.removeEventListener('click', onClick);
element.parentNode.removeChild(element);
// Now when element goes out of scope,
// both element and onClick will be collected even in old browsers // that don't handle cycles well.
```

You no longer need to call removeEventListener before making a node unreachable as modern browsers support garbage collectors that can detect these cycles and handle them appropriately.

If you leverage the jQuery APIs (other libraries and frameworks support this too) you can also have the listeners removed before a node is made obsolete. The library would also make sure there are no memory leaks even when the application is running under older browser versions.

#### 3. Closures

A key aspect of JavaScript development are closures: an inner function that has access to the outer (enclosing) function’s variables. Due to the implementation details of the JavaScript runtime, it is possible to leak memory in the following way:

```js
var theThing = null;
var replaceThing = function () {
  var originalThing = theThing;
  var unused = function () {
    if (originalThing) // a reference to 'originalThing'
      console.log("hi");
  };
  
  theThing = {
    longStr: new Array(1000000).join('*'),
    someMethod: function () {
      console.log("message");
    }
  };
};
setInterval(replaceThing, 1000);
```

Once replaceThing is called, theThing gets a new object which consists of a big array and a new closure (someMethod). Yet, originalThing is referenced by a closure that’s held by the unused variable (which is theThing variable from the previous call to replaceThing). The thing to remember is that once a scope for closures is created for closures in the same parent scope, the scope is shared.

In this case, the scope created for the closure someMethod is shared with unused. unused has a reference to originalThing. Even though unused is never used, someMethod can be used through theThing outside of the scope of replaceThing (e.g. somewhere globally). And as someMethod shares the closure scope with unused, the reference unused has to originalThing forces it to stay active (the whole shared scope between the two closures). This prevents its collection.

In the above example, the scope created for the closure someMethod is shared with unused, while unused references originalThing. someMethod can be used through theThing outside of the replaceThing scope, despite the fact that unused is never used. The fact that unused references originalThing requires that it remains active since someMethod shares the closure scope with unused.

All this can result in a considerable memory leak. You can expect to see a spike in memory usage when the above snippet is run over and over again. Its size won’t shrink when the garbage collector runs. A linked list of closures is created (its root is theThing variable in this case), and each the closure scopes carries forward an indirect reference to the big array.

This issue was found by the Meteor team and they have a great article that describes the issue in great detail.

2『上面闭包的案例解释目前消化不了，需要反复研读。（2020-04-09）』

#### 4. Out of DOM references

There are cases in which developers store DOM nodes inside data structures. Suppose you want to rapidly update the contents of several rows in a table. If you store a reference to each DOM row in a dictionary or an array, there will be two references to the same DOM element: one in the DOM tree and another in the dictionary. If you decide to get rid of these rows, you need to remember to make both references unreachable.

```js
var elements = {
    button: document.getElementById('button'),
    image: document.getElementById('image')
};
function doStuff() {
    elements.image.src = 'http://example.com/image_name.png';
}
function removeImage() {
    // The image is a direct child of the body element.
    document.body.removeChild(document.getElementById('image'));
    // At this point, we still have a reference to #button in the
    //global elements object. In other words, the button element is
    //still in memory and cannot be collected by the GC.
}
```

There’s an additional consideration that has to be taken into account when it comes to references to inner or leaf nodes inside a DOM tree. If you keep a reference to a table cell (a <td> tag) in your code and decide to remove the table from the DOM yet keep the reference to that particular cell, you can expect a major memory leak to follow. You might think that the garbage collector would free up everything but that cell. This will not be the case, however. Since the cell is a child node of the table and children keep references to their parents, this single reference to the table cell would keep the whole table in memory.

## 20200404Event-loop-and-the-rise-of-Async-programming-.md

How JavaScript works: Event loop and the rise of Async programming + 5 ways to better coding with async/await.

This time we’ll expand on our first post by reviewing the drawbacks to programming in a single-threaded environment and how to overcome them to build stunning JavaScript UIs. As the tradition goes, at the end of the article we’ll share 5 tips on how to write cleaner code with async/await. Why having a single thread is a limitation?

In the first post we launched, we pondered over the question what happens when you have function calls in the Call Stack that take a huge amount of time to be processed. Imagine, for example, a complex image transformation algorithm that’s running in the browser. While the Call Stack has functions to execute, the browser can’t do anything else — it’s being blocked. This means that the browser can’t render, it can’t run any other code, it’s just stuck. And here comes the problem — your app UI is no longer efficient and pleasing. Your app is stuck.

In some cases, this might not be such a critical issue. But hey — here’s an even bigger problem. Once your browser starts processing too many tasks in the Call Stack, it may stop being responsive for a long time. At that point, a lot of browsers would take action by raising an error, asking whether they should terminate the page.

### 01. The building blocks of a JavaScript program

You may be writing your JavaScript application in a single .js file, but your program is almost certainly comprised of several blocks, only one of which is going to execute now, and the rest will execute later. The most common block unit is the function.

The problem most developers new to JavaScript seem to have is understanding that later doesn’t necessarily happen strictly and immediately after now. In other words, tasks that cannot complete now are, by definition, going to complete asynchronously, which means you won’t have the above-mentioned blocking behavior as you might have subconsciously expected or hoped for. Let’s take a look at the following example:

```js
// ajax(..) is some arbitrary Ajax function given by a library
var response = ajax('https://example.com/api');

console.log(response);
// `response` won't have the response
```

You’re probably aware that standard Ajax requests don’t complete synchronously, which means that at the time of code execution the ajax(..) function does not yet have any value to return back to be assigned to a response variable. A simple way of「waiting」for an asynchronous function to return its result is to use a function called callback:

```js
ajax('https://example.com/api', function(response) {
    console.log(response); // `response` is now available
});
```

Just a note: you can actually make synchronous Ajax requests. Never, ever do that. If you make a synchronous Ajax request, the UI of your JavaScript app will be blocked — the user won’t be able to click, enter data, navigate, or scroll. This would prevent any user interaction. It’s a terrible practice. This is how it looks like, but please, never do this — don’t ruin the web:

```js
// This is assuming that you're using jQuery
jQuery.ajax({
    url: 'https://api.example.com/endpoint',
    success: function(response) {
        // This is your callback.
    },
    async: false // And this is a terrible idea
});
```

We used an Ajax request just as an example. You can have any chunk of code execute asynchronously. This can be done with the setTimeout(callback, milliseconds) function. What the setTimeout function does is to set up an event (a timeout) to happen later. Let’s take a look:

```js
function first() {
    console.log('first');
}
function second() {
    console.log('second');
}
function third() {
    console.log('third');
}
first();
setTimeout(second, 1000); // Invoke `second` after 1000ms
third();
```

The output in the console will be the following:

```
first
third
second
```

### 02. Dissecting the Event Loop

We’ll start with a somewhat of an odd claim — despite allowing async JavaScript code (like the setTimeout we just discussed), until ES6, JavaScript itself has actually never had any direct notion of asynchrony built into it. The JavaScript engine has never done anything more than executing a single chunk of your program at any given moment.

So, who tells the JS Engine to execute chunks of your program? In reality, the JS Engine doesn’t run in isolation — it runs inside a hosting environment, which for most developers is the typical web browser or Node.js. Actually, nowadays, JavaScript gets embedded into all kinds of devices, from robots to light bulbs. Every single device represents a different type of hosting environment for the JS Engine.

The common denominator in all environments is a built-in mechanism called the event loop, which handles the execution of multiple chunks of your program over time, each time invoking the JS Engine. This means that the JS Engine is just an on-demand execution environment for any arbitrary JS code. It’s the surrounding environment that schedules the events (the JS code executions).

So, for example, when your JavaScript program makes an Ajax request to fetch some data from the server, you set up the「response」code in a function (the「callback」), and the JS Engine tells the hosting environment:「Hey, I’m going to suspend execution for now, but whenever you finish with that network request, and you have some data, please call this function back.」The browser is then set up to listen for the response from the network, and when it has something to return to you, it will schedule the callback function to be executed by inserting it into the event loop. Let’s look at the below diagram:

And what are these Web APIs? In essence, they are threads that you can’t access, you can just make calls to them. They are the pieces of the browser in which concurrency kicks in. If you’re a Node.js developer, these are the C++ APIs. So what is the event loop after all?

The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, it will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop. Each event is just a function callback.

1『这里给出了事件循环的定义，做一张术语卡片。』

```js
console.log('Hi');
setTimeout(function cb1() { 
    console.log('cb1');
}, 5000);
console.log('Bye');
```

Let’s「execute」this code and see what happens:

1. The state is clear. The browser console is clear, and the Call Stack is empty.

2. console.log('Hi') is added to the Call Stack.

3. console.log('Hi') is executed.

4. console.log('Hi') is removed from the Call Stack.

5. setTimeout(function cb1() { ... }) is added to the Call Stack.

6. setTimeout(function cb1() { ... }) is executed. The browser creates a timer as part of the Web APIs. It is going to handle the countdown for you.

7. The setTimeout(function cb1() { ... }) itself is complete and is removed from the Call Stack.

8. console.log('Bye') is added to the Call Stack.

9. console.log('Bye') is executed.

10. console.log('Bye') is removed from the Call Stack.

11. After at least 5000 ms, the timer completes and it pushes the cb1 callback to the Callback Queue.

12. The Event Loop takes cb1 from the Callback Queue and pushes it to the Call Stack.

13. cb1 is executed and adds console.log('cb1') to the Call Stack.

14. console.log('cb1') is executed.

15. console.log('cb1') is removed from the Call Stack.

16. cb1 is removed from the Call Stack.

A quick recap: It’s interesting to note that ES6 specifies how the event loop should work, meaning that technically it’s within the scope of the JS engine’s responsibilities, which is no longer playing just a hosting environment role. One main reason for this change is the introduction of Promises in ES6 because the latter require access to a direct, fine-grained control over scheduling operations on the event loop queue (we’ll discuss them in a greater detail later).

### 04. What are Jobs in ES6 ?

A new concept called the「Job Queue」was introduced in ES6. It’s a layer on top of the Event Loop queue. You are most likely to bump into it when dealing with the asynchronous behavior of Promises (we’ll talk about them too). We’ll just touch on the concept now so that when we discuss async behavior with Promises, later on, you understand how those actions are being scheduled and processed.

Imagine it like this: the Job Queue is a queue that’s attached to the end of every tick in the Event Loop queue. Certain async actions that may occur during a tick of the event loop will not cause a whole new event to be added to the event loop queue, but will instead add an item (aka Job) to the end of the current tick’s Job queue. This means that you can add another functionality to be executed later, and you can rest assured that it will be executed right after, before anything else.

A Job can also cause more Jobs to be added to the end of the same queue. In theory, it’s possible for a Job「loop」(a Job that keeps adding other Jobs, etc.) to spin indefinitely, thus starving the program of the necessary resources needed to move on to the next event loop tick. Conceptually, this would be similar to just expressing a long-running or infinite loop (like while (true) ..) in your code. Jobs are kind of like the setTimeout(callback, 0)「hack」but implemented in such a way that they introduce a much more well-defined and guaranteed ordering: later, but as soon as possible.

### 05. Callbacks

As you already know, callbacks are by far the most common way to express and manage asynchrony in JavaScript programs. Indeed, the callback is the most fundamental async pattern in the JavaScript language. Countless JS programs, even very sophisticated and complex ones, have been written on top of no other async foundation than the callback. Except that callbacks don’t come with no shortcomings. Many developers are trying to find better async patterns. It’s impossible, however, to effectively use any abstraction if you don’t understand what’s actually under the hood. In the following chapter, we’ll explore couple of these abstractions in depth to show why more sophisticated async patterns (that will be discussed in subsequent posts) are necessary and even recommended.

### 06. Nested Callbacks

Look at the following code:

```js
listen('click', function (e){
    setTimeout(function(){
        ajax('https://api.example.com/endpoint', function (text){
            if (text == "hello") {
	        doSomething();
	    }
	    else if (text == "world") {
	        doSomethingElse();
            }
        });
    }, 500);
});
```

We’ve got a chain of three functions nested together, each one representing a step in an asynchronous series. This kind of code is often called a「callback hell」. But the「callback hell」actually has almost nothing to do with the nesting/indentation. It’s a much deeper problem than that.

First, we’re waiting for the「click」event, then we’re waiting for the timer to fire, then we’re waiting for the Ajax response to come back, at which point it might get all repeated again. At first glance, this code may seem to map its asynchrony naturally to sequential steps like:

```js
listen('click', function (e) {
	// ..
});
```

Then we have:

```js
setTimeout(function(){
    // ..
}, 500);
```

Then later we have:

```js
ajax('https://api.example.com/endpoint', function (text){
    // ..
});
```

And finally:

```js
if (text == "hello") {
    doSomething();
}
else if (text == "world") {
    doSomethingElse();
}
```

So, such a sequential way of expressing your async code seems a lot more natural, doesn’t it? There must be such a way, right?

### 07. Promises

Take a look at the following code:

```js
var x = 1;
var y = 2;
console.log(x + y);
```

It’s all very straightforward: it sums the values of x and y and prints it to the console. What if, however, the value of x or y was missing and was still to be determined? Say, we need to retrieve the values of both x and y from the server, before they can be used in the expression. Let’s imagine that we have a function loadX and loadY that respectively load the values of x and y from the server. Then, imagine that we have a function sum that sums the values of x and y once both of them are loaded. It could look like this (quite ugly, isn’t it):

```js
function sum(getX, getY, callback) {
    var x, y;
    getX(function(result) {
        x = result;
        if (y !== undefined) {
            callback(x + y);
        }
    });
    getY(function(result) {
        y = result;
        if (x !== undefined) {
            callback(x + y);
        }
    });
}
// A sync or async function that retrieves the value of `x`
function fetchX() {
    // ..
}


// A sync or async function that retrieves the value of `y`
function fetchY() {
    // ..
}
sum(fetchX, fetchY, function(result) {
    console.log(result);
});
```

There is something very important here — in that snippet, we treated x and y as future values, and we expressed an operation sum(…) that (from the outside) did not care whether x or y or both were or weren’t available right away. Of course, this rough callbacks-based approach leaves much to be desired. It’s just a first tiny step towards understanding the benefits of reasoning about future values without worrying about the time aspect of when they will be available.

### 08. Promise Value

Let’s just briefly glimpse at how we can express the x + y example with Promises:

```js
function sum(xPromise, yPromise) {
	// `Promise.all([ .. ])` takes an array of promises,
	// and returns a new promise that waits on them
	// all to finish
	return Promise.all([xPromise, yPromise])

	// when that promise is resolved, let's take the
	// received `X` and `Y` values and add them together.
	.then(function(values){
		// `values` is an array of the messages from the
		// previously resolved promises
		return values[0] + values[1];
	} );
}

// `fetchX()` and `fetchY()` return promises for
// their respective values, which may be ready
// *now* or *later*.
sum(fetchX(), fetchY())

// we get a promise back for the sum of those
// two numbers.
// now we chain-call `then(...)` to wait for the
// resolution of that returned promise.
.then(function(sum){
    console.log(sum);
});
```

There are two layers of Promises in this snippet.

fetchX() and fetchY() are called directly, and the values they return (promises!) are passed to sum(...). The underlying values these promises represent may be ready now or later, but each promise normalizes its behavior to be the same regardless. We reason about x and y values in a time-independent way. They are future values, period.

The second layer is the promise that sum(...) creates (via Promise.all([ ... ])) and returns, which we wait on by calling then(...). When the sum(...) operation completes, our sum future value is ready and we can print it out. We hide the logic for waiting on the x and y future values inside of sum(...) .

Note: Inside sum(…), the Promise.all([ … ]) call creates a promise (which is waiting on promiseX and promiseY to resolve). The chained call to .then(...) creates another promise, which the return values[0] + values[1] line immediately resolves (with the result of the addition). Thus, the then(...) call we chain off the end of the sum(...) call — at the end of the snippet — is actually operating on that second promise returned, rather than the first one created by Promise.all([ ... ]). Also, although we are not chaining off the end of that second then(...), it too has created another promise, had we chosen to observe/use it. This Promise chaining stuff will be explained in much greater detail later in this chapter.

With Promises, the then(...) call can actually take two functions, the first for fulfillment (as shown earlier), and the second for rejection:

```js
sum(fetchX(), fetchY())
.then(
    // fullfillment handler
    function(sum) {
        console.log( sum );
    },
    // rejection handler
    function(err) {
    	console.error( err ); // bummer!
    }
);
```

If something went wrong when getting x or y, or something somehow failed during the addition, the promise that sum(...) returns would be rejected, and the second callback error handler passed to then(...) would receive the rejection value from the promise.

Because Promises encapsulate the time-dependent state — waiting on the fulfillment or rejection of the underlying value — from the outside, the Promise itself is time-independent, and thus Promises can be composed (combined) in predictable ways regardless of the timing or outcome underneath.

Moreover, once a Promise is resolved, it stays that way forever — it becomes an immutable value at that point — and can then be observed as many times as necessary. It’s really useful that you can actually chain promises:

3『「0801小程序开发实战注意事项及进阶.md」

高磊的小程序里开发讲到过。Promise 异步操作函数有 2 个特点：1）Promise 函数有 3 个状态，第一个状态是 panding 进行中状态，表示当前异步操作是在进行中。第二个是 resolve 状态，表示当前异步操作已完成的状态。第三个状态是 reject 状态，表示异步操作失败的状态。需要说明的是，只有异步操作的结果才能说明当前异步操作是在哪一个状态，其他任意操作都不能改变其对应的状态的。2）第 2 个特点是，一旦 Promise 状态发生改变后它不会再发生其他任何的改变了，在其他任何时候都可以得到这个结果。对于 Promise 的状态改变只有两种结果：一是从 panding 状态变更为 resolve 状态；二是从 resolve 状态变更为 reject 状态。

』

```js
function delay(time) {
    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
        setTimeout(resolve, time);
    });
}

delay(1000)
.then(function(){
    console.log("after 1000ms");
    return delay(2000);
})
.then(function(){
    console.log("after another 2000ms");
})
.then(function(){
    console.log("step 4 (next Job)");
    return delay(5000);
})
// ...
```

Calling delay(2000) creates a promise that will fulfill in 2000ms, and then we return that from the first then(...) fulfillment callback, which causes the second then(...)'s promise to wait on that 2000ms promise.

Note: Because a Promise is externally immutable once resolved, it’s now safe to pass that value around to any party, knowing that it cannot be modified accidentally or maliciously. This is especially true in relation to multiple parties observing the resolution of a Promise. It’s not possible for one party to affect another party’s ability to observe Promise resolution. Immutability may sound like an academic topic, but it’s actually one of the most fundamental and important aspects of Promise design, and shouldn’t be casually passed over.

### 09. To Promise or not to Promise?

An important detail about Promises is knowing for sure if some value is an actual Promise or not. In other words, is it a value that will behave like a Promise?

We know that Promises are constructed by the new Promise(…) syntax, and you might think that p instanceof Promise would be a sufficient check. Well, not quite.

Mainly because you can receive a Promise value from another browser window (e.g. iframe), which would have its own Promise, different from the one in the current window or frame, and that check would fail to identify the Promise instance.

Moreover, a library or framework may choose to vend its own Promises and not use the native ES6 Promise implementation to do so. In fact, you may very well be using Promises with libraries in older browsers that have no Promise at all.

### 10. Swallowing exceptions

If at any point in the creation of a Promise, or in the observation of its resolution, a JavaScript exception error occurs, such as a TypeError or ReferenceError, that exception will be caught, and it will force the Promise in question to become rejected. For example:

```js
var p = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
    foo.bar();	  // `foo` is not defined, so error!
    resolve(374); // never gets here :(
});

p.then(
    function fulfilled(){
        // never gets here :(
    },
    function rejected(err){
        // `err` will be a `TypeError` exception object
	// from the `foo.bar()` line.
    }
);
```

But what happens if a Promise is fulfilled yet there was a JS exception error during the observation (in a then(…) registered callback)? Even though it won’t be lost, you may find the way they’re handled a bit surprising. Until you dig a little deeper:

```js
var p = new Promise( function(resolve,reject){
	resolve(374);
});

p.then(function fulfilled(message){
    foo.bar();
    console.log(message);   // never reached
},
    function rejected(err){
        // never reached
    }
);
```

It looks like the exception from foo.bar() really did get swallowed. It wasn’t, though. There was something deeper that went wrong, however, which we failed to listen for. The p.then(…) call itself returns another promise, and it’s that promise that will be rejected with the TypeError exception.

### 11. Handling uncaught exceptions

There are other approaches which many would say are better. A common suggestion is that Promises should have a done(…) added to them, which essentially marks the Promise chain as「done.」done(…) doesn’t create and return a Promise, so the callbacks passed to done(..) are obviously not wired up to report problems to a chained Promise that doesn’t exist. It’s treated as you might usually expect in uncaught error conditions: any exception inside a done(..) rejection handler would be thrown as a global uncaught error (in the developer console, basically):

```js
var p = Promise.resolve(374);

p.then(function fulfilled(msg){
    // numbers don't have string functions,
    // so will throw an error
    console.log(msg.toLowerCase());
})
.done(null, function() {
    // If an exception is caused here, it will be thrown globally 
});
```

### 12. What’s happening in ES8? Async/await

JavaScript ES8 introduced async/await that makes the job of working with Promises easier. We’ll briefly go through the possibilities async/await offers and how to leverage them to write async code. So, let’s see how async/await works.

You define an asynchronous function using the async function declaration. Such functions return an AsyncFunction object. The AsyncFunction object represents the asynchronous function which executes the code, contained within that function.

When an async function is called, it returns a Promise. When the async function returns a value, that’s not a Promise , a Promise will be automatically created and it will be resolved with the returned value from the function. When the async function throws an exception, the Promise will be rejected with the thrown value.

An async function can contain an await expression, that pauses the execution of the function and waits for the passed Promise’s resolution, and then resumes the async function’s execution and returns the resolved value. You can think of a Promise in JavaScript as the equivalent of Java’s Future or C#'s Task. The purpose of async/await is to simplify the behavior of using promises. Let’s take a look at the following example:

1『 async/await 的目的是封装 promises 的使用。』

```js
// Just a standard JavaScript function
function getNumber1() {
    return Promise.resolve('374');
}
// This function does the same as getNumber1
async function getNumber2() {
    return 374;
}
```

Similarly, functions that are throwing exceptions are equivalent to functions which return promises that have been rejected:

```js
function f1() {
    return Promise.reject('Some error');
}
async function f2() {
    throw 'Some error';
}
```

The await keyword can only be used in async functions and allows you to synchronously wait on a Promise. If we use promises outside of an async function, we’ll still have to use then callbacks:

```js
async function loadData() {
    // `rp` is a request-promise function.
    var promise1 = rp('https://api.example.com/endpoint1');
    var promise2 = rp('https://api.example.com/endpoint2');
   
    // Currently, both requests are fired, concurrently and
    // now we'll have to wait for them to finish
    var response1 = await promise1;
    var response2 = await promise2;
    return response1 + ' ' + response2;
}
// Since, we're not in an `async function` anymore
// we have to use `then`.
loadData().then(() => console.log('Done'));
```

You can also define async functions using an「async function expression」. An async function expression is very similar to and has almost the same syntax as, an async function statement. The main difference between an async function expression and an async function statement is the function name, which can be omitted in async function expressions to create anonymous functions. An async function expression can be used as an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) which runs as soon as it is defined. It looks like this:

```js
var loadData = async function() {
    // `rp` is a request-promise function.
    var promise1 = rp('https://api.example.com/endpoint1');
    var promise2 = rp('https://api.example.com/endpoint2');
   
    // Currently, both requests are fired, concurrently and
    // now we'll have to wait for them to finish
    var response1 = await promise1;
    var response2 = await promise2;
    return response1 + ' ' + response2;
}
```

More importantly, async/await is supported in all major browsers:
 
If this compatibility is not what you are after, there are also several JS transpilers like Babel and TypeScript.

At the end of the day, the important thing is not to blindly choose the「latest」approach to writing async code. It’s essential to understand the internals of async JavaScript, learn why it’s so critical and comprehend in-depth the internals of the method you have chosen. Every approach has pros and cons as with everything else in programming.

### 5 Tips on writing highly maintainable, non-brittle async code

#### 01. Clean code

Using async/await allows you to write a lot less code. Every time you use async/await you skip a few unnecessary steps: write .then, create an anonymous function to handle the response, name the response from that callback e.g.

```js
// `rp` is a request-promise function.
rp('https://api.example.com/endpoint1').then(function(data) {
 // …
});
```

Versus:

```js
// `rp` is a request-promise function.
var response = await rp('https://api.example.com/endpoint1');
```

#### 02. Error handling

Async/await makes it possible to handle both sync and async errors with the same code construct — the well-known try/catch statements. Let’s see how it looks with Promises:

```js
function loadData() {
    try { // Catches synchronous errors.
        getJSON().then(function(response) {
            var parsed = JSON.parse(response);
            console.log(parsed);
        }).catch(function(e) { // Catches asynchronous errors
            console.log(e); 
        });
    } catch(e) {
        console.log(e);
    }
}
```

Versus:

```js
async function loadData() {
    try {
        var data = JSON.parse(await getJSON());
        console.log(data);
    } catch(e) {
        console.log(e);
    }
}
```

### 03. Conditionals

Writing conditional code with async/await is a lot more straightforward:

```js
function loadData() {
  return getJSON()
    .then(function(response) {
      if (response.needsAnotherRequest) {
        return makeAnotherRequest(response)
          .then(function(anotherResponse) {
            console.log(anotherResponse)
            return anotherResponse
          })
      } else {
        console.log(response)
        return response
      }
    })
}
```

Versus:

```js
async function loadData() {
  var response = await getJSON();
  if (response.needsAnotherRequest) {
    var anotherResponse = await makeAnotherRequest(response);
    console.log(anotherResponse)
    return anotherResponse
  } else {
    console.log(response);
    return response;    
  }
}
```

#### 04. Stack Frames

Unlike with async/await, the error stack returned from a promise chain gives no clue of where the error happened. Look at the following:

```js
function loadData() {
  return callAPromise()
    .then(callback1)
    .then(callback2)
    .then(callback3)
    .then(() => {
      throw new Error("boom");
    })
}
loadData()
  .catch(function(e) {
    console.log(err);
// Error: boom at callAPromise.then.then.then.then (index.js:8:13)
});
```

Versus:

```js
async function loadData() {
  await callAPromise1()
  await callAPromise2()
  await callAPromise3()
  await callAPromise4()
  await callAPromise5()
  throw new Error("boom");
}
loadData()
  .catch(function(e) {
    console.log(err);
    // output
    // Error: boom at loadData (index.js:7:9)
});
```

#### 05. Debugging

If you have used promises, you know that debugging them is a nightmare. For example, if you set a breakpoint inside a .then block and use debug shortcuts like「stop-over」, the debugger will not move to the following .then because it only「steps」through synchronous code. With async/await you can step through await calls exactly as if they were normal synchronous functions.

Writing async JavaScript code is important not only for the apps themselves but for libraries as well. For example, the SessionStack library records everything in your web app/website: all DOM changes, user interactions, JavaScript exceptions, stack traces, failed network requests, and debug messages. And this all has to happen in your production environment without impacting any of the UX. We need to heavily optimize our code and make it asynchronous as much as possible so that we can increase the number of events that are being processed by the Event Loop.

And not just the library! When you replay a user session in SessionStack, we have to render everything that happened in your user’s browser at the time the problem occurred, and we have to reconstruct the whole state, allowing you to jump back and forth in the session timeline. In order to make this possible, we’re heavily employing the async opportunities that JavaScript provides. There is a free plan that allows you to get started for free.

## 20200405Deep-dive-into-WebSockets-and-HTTP-.md

How JavaScript works: Deep dive into WebSockets and HTTP/2 with SSE + how to pick the right path.

This time we’ll dive into the world of communication protocols, mapping and discussing their attributes and building parts on the way. We’ll offer a quick comparison of WebSockets and HTTP/2. At the end, we share some ideas on how to choose which way to go when it comes to network protocols.

### 01. Intro

Nowadays complex web apps that feature rich, dynamic UIs are taken for granted. And it’s not surprising — the internet has come a long way since its inception. Initially, the internet wasn’t built to support such dynamic and complex web apps. It was conceived to be a collection of HTML pages, linking to one another to form the concept of「web」that contains information. Everything was largely built around the so-called request/response paradigm of HTTP. A client loads up a page and then nothing happens until the user clicks and navigates to the next page.

Around 2005, AJAX was introduced and a lot of people started to explore the possibilities of making connections between a client and а server bidirectional. Still, all HTTP communication was steered by the client, which required user interaction or periodic polling to load new data from the server.

### 02. Making HTTP「bidirectional」

Technologies that enable the server to send data to the client「proactively」have been around for quite some time.「Push」and「Comet」to name a few. One of the most common hacks to create the illusion that the server is sending data to the client is called long polling. With long polling, the client opens an HTTP connection to the server which keeps it open until a response is sent. Whenever the server has new data that has to be sent, it transmits it as a response. Let’s see how a very simple long polling snippet might look like:

```js
(function poll(){
   setTimeout(function(){
      $.ajax({ 
        url: 'https://api.example.com/endpoint', 
        success: function(data) {
          // Do something with `data`
          // ...

          //Setup the next poll recursively
          poll();
        }, 
        dataType: 'json'
      });
  }, 10000);
})();
```

This is basically a self-executing function that runs the first time automatically. It sets up the ten (10) second interval and after each async Ajax call to the server, the callback calls ajax again. Other techniques involve Flash or XHR multipart request and the so-called htmlfiles.

All these workarounds share the same problem though: they carry the overhead of HTTP, which doesn’t make them well-suited for low-latency applications. Think multiplayer first-person shooter games in the browser or any other online game with a realtime component.

### 03. The introduction of WebSockets

The WebSocket specification defines an API establishing「socket」connections between a web browser and a server. In plain words: there is a persistent connection between the client and the server and both parties can start sending data at any time.

3『 [The WebSocket API (WebSockets) - Web APIs | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API) 』

The client establishes a WebSocket connection through a process known as the WebSocket handshake. This process starts with the client sending a regular HTTP request to the server. An Upgrade header is included in this request which informs the server that the client wishes to establish a WebSocket connection. Let’s see how opening a WebSocket connection looks like on the client side:

```js
// Create a new WebSocket with an encrypted connection.
var socket = new WebSocket('ws://websocket.example.com');
```

WebSocket URLs use the ws scheme. There is also wss for secure WebSocket connections which is the equivalent of HTTPS. This scheme just starts the process of opening a WebSocket connection towards websocket.example.com. Here is a simplified example of the initial request headers.

```
GET ws://websocket.example.com/ HTTP/1.1
Origin: http://example.com
Connection: Upgrade
Host: websocket.example.com
Upgrade: websocket
```

If the server supports the WebSocket protocol, it will agree to the upgrade and will communicate this through the Upgrade header in the response. Let’s see how this can be implemented in Node.JS:

```js
// We'll be using the https://github.com/theturtle32/WebSocket-Node
// WebSocket implementation
var WebSocketServer = require('websocket').server;
var http = require('http');

var server = http.createServer(function(request, response) {
  // process HTTP request. 
});
server.listen(1337, function() { });

// create the server
wsServer = new WebSocketServer({
  httpServer: server
});

// WebSocket server
wsServer.on('request', function(request) {
  var connection = request.accept(null, request.origin);

  // This is the most important callback for us, we'll handle
  // all messages from users here.
  connection.on('message', function(message) {
      // Process WebSocket message
  });

  connection.on('close', function(connection) {
    // Connection closes
  });
});
```

After the connection is established, the server replies by upgrading:

```
HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols
Date: Wed, 25 Oct 2017 10:07:34 GMT
Connection: Upgrade
Upgrade: WebSocket
```

Once the connection has been established, the open event will be fired on your WebSocket instance on the client side:

```js
var socket = new WebSocket('ws://websocket.example.com');

// Show a connected message when the WebSocket is opened.
socket.onopen = function(event) {
  console.log('WebSocket is connected.');
};
```

Now that the handshake is complete the initial HTTP connection is replaced by a WebSocket connection that uses the same underlying TCP/IP connection. At this point, either party can start sending data.

With WebSockets, you can transfer as much data as you like without incurring the overhead associated with traditional HTTP requests. Data is transferred through a WebSocket as messages, each of which consists of one or more frames containing the data you are sending (the payload). In order to ensure the message can be properly reconstructed when it reaches the client each frame is prefixed with 4–12 bytes of data about the payload. Using this frame-based messaging system helps to reduce the amount of non-payload data that is transferred, leading to significant reductions in latency.

Note: It’s worth noting that the client will only be notified about a new message once all of the frames have been received and the original message payload has been reconstructed.

### 04. WebSocket URLs

We briefly mentioned before that WebSockets introduce a new URL scheme. In reality, they introduce two new schemes: ws:// and wss://. URLs have scheme-specific grammar. WebSocket URLs are special in that that they do not support anchors ( #sample_anchor ). The same rules apply to WebSocket style URLs as to HTTP style URLs. ws is unencrypted and has port 80 as default, while wss requires TLS encryption and has port 443 as default.

### 05. Framing protocol

Let’s take a deeper look at the framing protocol. This is what the RFC provides us with:

```js
      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-------+-+-------------+-------------------------------+
     |F|R|R|R| opcode|M| Payload len |    Extended payload length    |
     |I|S|S|S|  (4)  |A|     (7)     |             (16/64)           |
     |N|V|V|V|       |S|             |   (if payload len==126/127)   |
     | |1|2|3|       |K|             |                               |
     +-+-+-+-+-------+-+-------------+ - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - +
     |     Extended payload length continued, if payload len == 127  |
     + - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - +-------------------------------+
     |                               |Masking-key, if MASK set to 1  |
     +-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
     | Masking-key (continued)       |          Payload Data         |
     +-------------------------------- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - +
     :                     Payload Data continued ...                :
     + - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - +
     |                     Payload Data continued ...                |
     +---------------------------------------------------------------+
```

As of the WebSocket version specified by the RFC, there’s only a header in front of each packet. It’s quite a complex header, however. Here are its building blocks explained:

1. fin (1 bit): indicates if this frame is the final frame that makes up the message. Most of the time the message fits into a single frame and this bit will always be set. Experiments show that Firefox makes a second frame after 32K.

2. rsv1, rsv2, rsv3 (1 bit each): must be 0 unless an extension is negotiated that defines meanings for non-zero values. If a nonzero value is received and none of the negotiated extensions defines the meaning of such a nonzero value, the receiving endpoint must fail the connection.

3. opcode (4 bits): says what the frame represents. The following values are currently in use:

    0x00: this frame continues the payload from the previous.
    
    0x01: this frame includes text data.
    
    0x02: this frame includes binary data.
    
    0x08: this frame terminates the connection.
    
    0x09: this frame is a ping.
    
    0x0a: this frame is a pong.
    
    (As you can see, there are enough values unused; they’ve been reserved for future use).

4. mask (1 bit): indicates if the connection is masked. As it stands right now, every message from a client to a server must be masked and the spec would want to terminate the connection if it’s unmasked.

5. payload_len (7 bits): the length of the payload. WebSocket frames come in the following length brackets: 0–125 indicates the length of the payload. 126 means that the following two bytes indicate the length, 127 means the next 8 bytes indicate the length. So the length of the payload comes in ~7bit, 16bit, and 64bit brackets.

6. masking-key (32 bits): all frames sent from the client to the server are masked by a 32-bit value that is contained within the frame.

7. payload: the actual data which most likely is masked. Its length is the length of the payload_len.

Why are WebSockets frame-based and not stream-based? I don’t know and just like you, I’d love to learn more, so if you have an idea, feel free to add comments and resources in the responses below. Also, a good discussion on the topic is available on HackerNews.

3『 [news.ycombinator.com](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3377406) 』

### 06. Data on the frames

As mentioned above, the data can be fragmented into multiple frames. The first frame that transmits the data has an opcode on it that indicates what sort of data is being transmitted. This is necessary because JavaScript has pretty much nonexistent support for binary data at the time the specification was started. 0x01 indicates utf-8 encoded text data, 0x02 is binary data. Most people will transmit JSON in which case you’d probably want to choose the text opcode. When you emit binary data it will be represented in a browser specific Blob.

The API for sending data through a WebSocket is very simple:

```js
var socket = new WebSocket('ws://websocket.example.com');
socket.onopen = function(event) {
  socket.send('Some message'); // Sends data to server.
};
```

When the WebSocket is receiving data (on the client side), a message event is fired. This event includes a property called data that can be used to access the contents of the message.

```js
// Handle messages sent by the server.
socket.onmessage = function(event) {
  var message = event.data;
  console.log(message);
};
```

You can easily explore the data in each of the frames in your WebSocket connection using the Network Tab inside Chrome DevTools:

### 07. Fragmentation

Payload data can be split up into multiple individual frames. The receiving end is supposed to buffer them up until the fin bit is set. So you can transmit the string「Hello World」in 11 packages of 6 (header length) + 1 byte each. Fragmentation is not allowed for control packages. However, the specification wants you to be able to handle interleaved control frames. That’s in case TCP packages arrive in arbitrary order.

The logic for joining frames is roughly the following: 1) receive the first frame. 2) remember opcode. 3) concatenate frame payload together until the fin bit is set. 4) assert that the opcode for each package is zero.

The primary purpose of fragmentation is to allow sending a message that is of unknown size when the message is started. With fragmentation, a server may choose a reasonable size buffer and, when the buffer is full, write a fragment to the network. A secondary use case for fragmentation is for multiplexing, where it is not desirable for a large message on one logical channel to take over the whole output channel, so the multiplexing needs to be free to split the message into smaller fragments to better share the output channel.

### 08. What is Hearbeating?

At any point after the handshake, either the client or the server can choose to send a ping to the other party. When the ping is received, the recipient must send back a pong as soon as possible. That’s a heartbeat. You can use it to make sure that the client is still connected.

A ping or pong is just a regular frame, but it’s a control frame. Pings have an opcode of 0x9, and pongs have an opcode of 0xA. When you get a ping, send back a pong with the exact same Payload Data as the ping (for pings and pongs, the max payload length is 125). You might also get a pong without ever sending a ping. Ignore it if it happens.

Heartbeating can be very useful. There are services (like load balancers) that will terminate idle connections. Plus, it’s not possible for the receiving side to see if the remote side has terminated. Only at the next send would you realize that something went wrong.

### 09. Handling Errors

You can handle any errors that occur by listening out for the error event. It looks like this:

```js
var socket = new WebSocket('ws://websocket.example.com');

// Handle any error that occurs.
socket.onerror = function(error) {
  console.log('WebSocket Error: ' + error);
};
```

### 10. Closing the Connection

To close a connection either the client or server should send a control frame with data containing an opcode of 0x8. Upon receiving such a frame, the other peer sends a Close frame in response. The first peer then closes the connection. Any further data received after closing the connection is then discarded. This is how you initiate the closing of a WebSocket connection from the client:

```js
// Close if the connection is open.
if (socket.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
    socket.close();
}
```

Also, in order to perform any clean up after the closing has completed, you can attach an event listener to the close event:

```js
// Do necessary clean up.
socket.onclose = function(event) {
  console.log('Disconnected from WebSocket.');
};
```

The server has to listen on the close event in order to process it if needed:

```js
connection.on('close', function(reasonCode, description) {
    // The connection is getting closed.
});
```

### 11. How do WebSockets and HTTP/2 compare?

While HTTP/2 has a lot to offer, it doesn’t completely replace the need for existing push/streaming technologies.

The first important thing to notice about HTTP/2 is that it’s not a replacement for all of HTTP. The verbs, status codes and most of the headers will remain the same as today. HTTP/2 is about improving the efficiency of the way data is transferred on the wire. Now, if we compare HTTP/2 to WebSocket, we can see a lot of similarities:

As we have seen above, HTTP/2 introduces Server Push which enables the server to proactively send resources to the client cache. It does not, however, allow for pushing data down to the client application itself. Server pushes are only processed by the browser and do not pop up in the application code, meaning there is no API for the application to get notifications for those events.

This is where Server-Sent Events (SSE) become very useful. SSE is a mechanism that allows the server to asynchronously push the data to the client once the client-server connection is established. The server can then decide to send data whenever a new「chunk」of data is available. It can be considered as a one-way publish-subscribe model. It also offers a standard JavaScript client API named EventSource implemented in most modern browsers as part of the HTML5 standard by W3C. Note that browsers that do not support EventSource API can be easily polyfilled.

Since SSE is based on HTTP, it has a natural fit with HTTP/2 and can be combined to get the best of both: HTTP/2 handling an efficient transport layer based on multiplexed streams and SSE providing the API up to the applications to enable push.

To fully understand what Streams and Multiplexing are all about, let’s first have a look at the IETF definition: a「stream」is an independent, bidirectional sequence of frames exchanged between the client and server within an HTTP/2 connection. One of its main characteristics is that a single HTTP/2 connection can contain multiple concurrently open streams, with either endpoint interleaving frames from multiple streams.

We have to remember that SSE is HTTP-based. It means that with HTTP/2, not only can several SSE streams be interleaved onto a single TCP connection, but the same can also be done with a combination of several SSE streams (server to client push) and several client requests (client to server). Thanks to HTTP/2 and SSE, now we have a pure HTTP bidirectional connection with a simple API to let application code register to server pushes. Lack of bidirectional capabilities has often been perceived as a major drawback when comparing SSE to WebSocket. Thanks to HTTP/2 this is no longer the case. This opens up the opportunity to skip WebSockets and stick to an HTTP-based signaling instead.

### 12. How to choose between WebSocket and HTTP/2?

WebSockets will certainly survive the domination of HTTP/2 + SSE, mainly because it’s a technology already well adopted and, in very specific use cases, it has an advantage over HTTP/2 as it has been built for bidirectional capabilities with less overhead (e.g. headers). Say you want to build a Massive Multiplayer Online Game that needs a huge amount of messages from both ends of the connection. In such a case, WebSockets will perform much, much better.

In general, use WebSockets whenever you need a truly low-latency, near realtime connection between the client and the server. Keep in mind that this might require rethinking how you build your server-side applications, as well as shifting the focus on technologies like event queues.

If your use case requires displaying real-time market news, market data, chat applications, etc., relying on HTTP/2 + SSE will provide you with an efficient bidirectional communication channel while reaping the benefits from staying in the HTTP world:

1. WebSockets can often be a source of pain when considering compatibility with existing web infrastructure as it upgrades an HTTP connection to a completely different protocol that has nothing to do with HTTP.

2. Scale and security: Web components (Firewalls, Intrusion Detection, Load Balancers) are built, maintained and configured with HTTP in mind, an environment that large/critical applications will prefer in terms of resiliency, security, and scalability. 

Also, you have to take into consideration browser support. Have a look at the WebSocket:

It’s quite good actually, isn’t it? The situation with HTTP/2, however, is not the same:

1) TLS-only (which is not so bad). 2) Partial support in IE 11 but only on Windows 10. 3) Only supported on OSX 10.11+ in Safari. 4) Only supports HTTP/2 if you can negotiate it via ALPN (which is something your server needs to support explicitly).

The SSE support is better though:

Only IE/Edge don’t provide support. (Well, Opera Mini supports neither SSE nor WebSockets so we can take it out of the equation altogether). There are some decent polyfills out there for SSE support in IE/Edge.

### 13. How we make the decision at SessionStack

We at SessionStack use both WebSockets and HTTP, depending on the case. Once you integrate SessionStack into your web app, it starts recording all DOM changes, user interactions, JavaScript exceptions, stack traces, failed network requests, and debug messages, allowing you to replay issues in your web apps as videos and see everything that happened to your users. It’s all taking place real-time and needs to happen with no performance impact for your web app.

This means that you can join a user session live, while the user is still in the browser. In this scenario, we have chosen to leverage HTTP, since there is no bidirectional communication (the server just「streams」the data to the browser). A WebSocket, in this case, will be an overkill really, harder to maintain and scale.

The SessionStack library that gets integrated into your web app, however, uses a WebSocket (if possible, otherwise falls back to HTTP). It’s batching and sending the data to our servers which is also a one-way communication. We chose WebSocket in this case because some of the product features that are on the roadmap would require a bidirectional communication.

If you’d like to try SessionStack to understand and reproduce technical and UX problems in your web apps, we provide a free plan that allows you to get started for free.

## 20200406A-comparison-with-WebAssembly-.md

How JavaScript works: A comparison with WebAssembly + why in certain cases it’s better to use it over JavaScript.

This time we’ll take apart WebAssembly to analyze how it works, and more importantly, how it stacks against JavaScript in terms of performance: loading time, execution speed, garbage collection, memory usage, platform API access, debugging, multithreading and portability. The way we build web apps is on the brink of revolution — this is still the early days but the way we think about web applications is going to change.

### 01. First, let’s see what WebAssembly does

WebAssembly (a.k.a. wasm) is an efficient, low-level bytecode for the web. WASM enables you to use languages other than JavaScript (e.g. C, C++, Rust or other), write your program in it, and then compile it (ahead of time) to WebAssembly. The result is a web app that’s very fast to load and execute.

### 02. Loading time

In order to load JavaScript, the browser has to load all the `.js` files which are textual. WebAssembly is faster to load inside the browser because only the already-compiled wasm files have to be transported over the internet. And wasm is a low-level assembly-like language with a very compact binary format.

### 03. Execution

Today Wasm runs just 20% slower than native code execution. This is, by all means, an astonishing result. It’s a format that’s compiled into a sandbox environment and runs within a whole lot of constraints to make sure it has no security vulnerabilities or is very hardened against them. The slowdown is minimal compared to truly native code. What’s more, it will be even faster in the future.

Better yet, it’s browser-agnostic — all major engines added support for WebAssembly and offer similar execution times now. In order to understand how faster WebAssembly executes compared to JavaScript, you should first read our article on how the JavaScript engine works. Let’s take a look at what happens in V8 as a quick overview:

V8 Approach: lazy compilation

On the left, we have some JavaScript source, containing JavaScript functions. It first needs to be parsed so that it converts all the strings into tokens and generates an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). The AST is an in-memory representation of the logic of your JavaScript program. Once this representation is generated, V8 goes straight to machine code. You basically walk the tree, generate machine code and there you have your compiled function. There is no real attempt made to speed it up. Now, let’s take a look at what the V8 pipeline does at the next stage:

V8 Pipeline Design

This time we have TurboFan, one of V8’s optimizing compilers. While your JavaScript app is running, a lot of code is running inside V8. TurboFan monitors if something is running slow, whether there are bottlenecks and hot spots in order to optimize them. It pushes them through that backend, which is an optimized JIT that creates much faster code for those functions which are chewing up most of your CPU.

It solves the problem but the gotcha here is that the process of analyzing the code and deciding what to optimize also consumes CPU. This, in turn, means higher battery consumption, especially on mobile devices. Well, wasm doesn’t need all that — it gets plugged into the workflow like this:

V8 Pipeline Design + WASM

The wasm has already gone through optimization during the compilation phase. On top, parsing is not needed either. You have an optimized binary that can directly hook into the backend which can generate machine code. All the optimizations have been done by the compiler at the front end. This makes the execution of wasm a lot more efficient since quite a few of the steps in the process can simply be skipped.

### 04. Memory model

WebAssembly trusted and untrusted state

The memory of a C++ program, for example, compiled into WebAssembly, is a contiguous block of memory with no「holes」in it. One of the features of wasm that helps boost security is the concept of the execution stack being separate from the linear memory. In a C++ program, you have a heap, you allocate from the bottom of the heap, and grow the stack from the top of the heap. It’s possible to take a pointer and then look up in the stack memory in order to play with variables you’re not supposed to touch.

This is a pitfall that a lot of malware exploit.

WebAssembly employs a completely different model. The execution stack is separated from the WebAssembly program itself, so there is no way you can modify inside it and change things like variables. Also, the functions use integer offsets rather than pointers. Functions point into an indirection function table. And then those direct, calculated numbers jump in the function inside the module. It’s been built this way so that you can load multiple wasm modules side by side, offset all the indexes and it all works well.

For more information on the memory model and management in JavaScript, you can check our very detailed post on the topic.

### 05. Garbage collection

You already know that JavaScript’s memory management is handled with a Garbage Collector. WebAssembly’s case is a bit different. It supports languages that manage memory manually. You can ship your own GC with your wasm modules, but it’s a complicated task.

Currently, WebAssembly is designed around the C++ and RUST use cases. Since wasm is very low-level, it makes sense that programming languages that are just one step above assembly language would be easy to compile to it. C can use normal malloc, C++ might use smart pointers, Rust employs a totally different paradigm (a whole different topic). These languages don’t use GCs, so they don’t need all the complicated runtime stuff to keep track memory. WebAssembly is a natural fit for them.

In addition, these languages aren’t 100% designed to call into complex JavaScript things like mutating the DOM. It doesn’t make sense to write an entire HTML application in C++ because C++ isn’t designed for it. In most cases, when engineers write C++ or Rust, they target WebGL, or highly-optimized libraries (e.g. heavy-math computations).

In the future, however, WebAssembly will support languages that don’t come with a GC.

### 06. Platform API access

Depending on the runtime that executes JavaScript, access to platform-specific APIs is being exposed which can be directly reached through your JavaScript application. For example, if you’re running JavaScript in the browser, you have a set of Web APIs that the web app can call to control web browser/device functionality and access things like DOM, CSSOM, WebGL, IndexedDB, Web Audio API, etc.

Well, WebAssembly modules have no access to any platform APIs. Everything is mediated by JavaScript. If you want to access some platform-specific APIs inside your WebAssembly module, you have to call it through JavaScript.

For example, if you want to console.log, you have to call it through JavaScript, instead of your C++ code. And there is a cost penalty for those JavaScript calls.

This won’t be always the case. The specification will provide Platform APIs to wasm in the future, and you’ll be able to ship your apps without JavaScript.

### 07. Source maps

When you minify your JavaScript code, you need a way to debug it properly. That’s where Source Maps come to the rescue.

Basically, Source Maps are a way to map a combined/minified file back to an unbuilt state. When you build for production, along with minifying and combining your JavaScript files, you generate a source map which holds information about the original files. When you query a certain line and column number in your generated JavaScript, you can do a lookup in the source map which returns the original location.

WebAssembly does not currently support source maps because there is no specification but it will, eventually (probably quite soon).

When you set a breakpoint in your C++ code, you’ll see the C++ code instead of WebAssembly. At least, that’s the goal.

### 08. Multithreading

JavaScript runs on a single thread. There are ways to utilize the Event Loop and leverage asynchronous programming as described in a great detail in our article on the topic.

JavaScript also uses Web Workers but they have a very specific use case — basically, any intense CPU computation that would block the main UI thread could benefit from being offloaded to a Web Worker. However, Web Workers have no access to the DOM.

WebAssembly doesn’t currently support multithreading. However, this is probably the next thing to come. Wasm is going to get closer to native threads (e.g. C++ style threads). Having「real」threads is going to create a lot of new opportunities in the browser. And of course, it’s going to open the door to more possibilities for abuse.

### 09. Portability

Nowadays JavaScript can run almost anywhere, from the browser to the server-side and even in embedded systems.

WebAssembly is designed to be safe and portable. Just like JavaScript. It will run in every environment that supports wasm (e.g. every browser).

WebAssembly has the same portability goal as the one Java attempted to achieve in the early days with the Applets.

### 10. Where is it better to use WebAssembly over JavaScript?

In the first versions of WebAssembly, the main focus is on heavy CPU-bound computations (dealing with math for example). The most mainstream use that comes to mind is games — there are tons of pixel manipulations there. You can write your app in C++/Rust using OpenGL bindings that you’re used to, and compile it to wasm. And it will run in the browser.

Take a look at this (Run it in Firefox) — http://s3.amazonaws.com/mozilla-games/tmp/2017-02-21-SunTemple/SunTemple.html. That’s running the Unreal engine.

Another case where it could make sense to use WebAssembly (performance-wise) is implementing some library that is doing very CPU-intensive work. For example, some image manipulation.

As mentioned earlier, wasm can reduce quite a bit the battery consumption on mobile devices (depending on the engine), since most of the processing steps have been completed ahead of time during compilation.

In the future, you’ll be able to consume WASM binaries even if you’re not actually writing code that compiles to it. You can find projects in NPM that are starting to use this approach.

For DOM manipulation and heavy platform API usage, it definitely makes sense to stay with JavaScript, since it adds no further overhead, and has the APIs provided natively.

At SessionStack we are constantly pushing the boundaries of JavaScript performance in order to write highly-optimized and efficient code. Our solution needs to provide blazing-fast performance as we can’t afford to impede the performance of our customers’ apps. Once you integrate SessionStack into your production web application or website, it starts recording everything: all DOM changes, user interactions, JavaScript exceptions, stack traces, failed network requests, and debug data. And all this takes place in your production environment without impacting any of the UX and performance of your product. We need to heavily optimize our code and make it asynchronous as much as possible.

And not just the library! When you replay a user session in SessionStack, we have to render everything that happened in your user’s browser at the time the problem occurred, and we have to reconstruct the whole state, allowing you to jump back and forth in the session timeline. In order to make this possible, we’re heavily employing the async opportunities that JavaScript provides due to a lack of a better alternative.

With WebAssembly, we’ll be able to push some of the heaviest processing and rendering into a language that is better suited for the job and leave the data collection and DOM manipulation to JavaScript.

If you want to give SessionStack a try, you can get started for free. There’s a free plan that provides 1,000 sessions / month.
