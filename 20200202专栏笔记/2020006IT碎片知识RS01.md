## 20200320Laravel-API-Tutorial-.md

With the rise of mobile development and JavaScript frameworks, using a RESTful API is the best option to build a single interface between your data and your client. Laravel is a PHP framework developed with PHP developer productivity in mind. Written and maintained by Taylor Otwell, the framework is very opinionated and strives to save developer time by favoring convention over configuration. The framework also aims to evolve with the web and has already incorporated several new features and ideas in the web development world—such as job queues, API authentication out of the box, real-time communication, and much more.

### 01. RESTful APIs

First, we need to understand what exactly is considered a RESTful API. REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer and is an architectural style for network communication between applications, which relies on a stateless protocol (usually HTTP) for interaction.

#### 1. HTTP Verbs Represent Actions

In RESTful APIs, we use the HTTP verbs as actions, and the endpoints are the resources acted upon. We’ll be using the HTTP verbs for their semantic meaning:

```
GET: retrieve resources
POST: create resources
PUT: update resources
DELETE: delete resources
```

HTTP verbs: GET, POST, PUT and DELETE are actions in RESTful APIs

#### 2. Update Action: PUT vs. POST

RESTful APIs are a matter of much debate and there are plenty of opinions out there on whether is best to update with POST, PATCH, or PUT, or if the create action is best left to the PUT verb. In this article we’ll be using PUT for the update action, as according to the HTTP RFC, PUT means to create/update a resource at a specific location. Another requirement for the PUT verb is idempotence, which in this case basically means you can send that request 1, 2 or 1000 times and the result will be the same: one updated resource in the database.

#### 3. Resources

Resources will be the targets of the actions, in our case Articles and Users, and they have their own endpoints:

```
/articles
/users
```

In this laravel api tutorial, the resources will have a 1:1 representation on our data models, but that is not a requirement. You can have resources represented in more than one data model (or not represented at all in the database) and models completely off limits for the user. In the end, you get to decide how to architect resources and models in a way that is fitting to your application.

#### 4. A Note on Consistency

The greatest advantage of using a set of conventions such as REST is that your API will be much easier to consume and develop around. Some endpoints are pretty straightforward and, as a result, your API will be much more easier to use and maintain as opposed to having endpoints such as GET /get\_article?id\_article=12 and POST /delete\_article?number=40. I’ve built terrible APIs like that in the past and I still hate myself for it.

However, there will be cases where it will be hard to map to a Create/Retrieve/Update/Delete schema. Remember that the URLs should not contain verbs and that resources are not necessarily rows in a table. Another thing to keep in mind is that you don’t have to implement every action for every resource.

### 02. Setting Up a Laravel Web Service Project

### 03. Migrations and Models

Before actually writing your first migration, make sure you have a database created for this app and add its credentials to the .env file located in the root of the project.

```
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=homestead
DB_USERNAME=homestead
DB_PASSWORD=secret
```

You can also use Homestead, a Vagrant box specially crafted for Laravel, but that is a bit out of the scope of this article. If you’d like to know more, refer to the Homestead documentation. Let’s get started with our first model and migration—the Article. The article should have a title and a body field, as well as a creation date. Laravel provides several commands through Artisan—Laravel’s command line tool—that help us by generating files and putting them in the correct folders. To create the Article model, we can run:

    $ php artisan make:model Article -m

The -m option is short for --migration and it tells Artisan to create one for our model. Here’s the generated migration:

```php
<?php

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;
use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;
use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;

class CreateArticlesTable extends Migration
{
    /**
     * Run the migrations.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function up()
    {
        Schema::create('articles', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->increments('id');
            $table->timestamps();
        });
    }

    /**
     * Reverse the migrations.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function down()
    {
        Schema::dropIfExists('articles');
    }
}
```

Let’s dissect this for a second: 1) The up() and down() methods will be run when we migrate and rollback respectively; 2) \$table->increments('id') sets up an auto incrementing integer with the name id; 3) \$table->timestamps() will set up the timestamps for us—created_at and updated_at, but don't worry about setting a default, Laravel takes care of updating these fields when needed. 4) And finally, Schema::dropIfExists() will, of course, drop the table if it exists.

With that out of the way, let’s add two lines to our up() method:

```php
public function up()
{
    Schema::create('articles', function (Blueprint $table) {
        $table->increments('id');
        $table->string('title');
        $table->text('body');
        $table->timestamps();
    });
}
```

The string() method creates a VARCHAR equivalent column while text() creates a TEXTequivalent. With that done, let’s go ahead and migrate:

    $ php artisan migrate

You can also use the --step option here, and it will separate each migration into its own batch so that you can roll them back individually if needed. Laravel out of the box comes with two migrations, create\_users\_table and create\_password\_resets\_table. We won’t be using the password\_resets table, but having the users table ready for us will be helpful.

Now let’s go back to our model and add those attributes to the \$fillable field so that we can use them in our Article::create and Article::update models:

```php
class Article extends Model
{
    protected $fillable = ['title', 'body'];
}
```

Fields inside the \$fillable property can be mass assigned using Eloquent’s create() and update()methods. You can also use the \$guarded property, to allow all but a few properties.

### 04. Database Seeding

Database seeding is the process of filling up our database with dummy data that we can use to test it. Laravel comes with Faker, a great library for generating just the correct format of dummy data for us. So let’s create our first seeder:

    $ php artisan make:seeder ArticlesTableSeeder

The seeders will be located in the /database/seeds directory. Here’s how it looks like after we set it up to create a few articles:

```php
class ArticlesTableSeeder extends Seeder
{
    public function run()
    {
        // Let's truncate our existing records to start from scratch.
        Article::truncate();

        $faker = \Faker\Factory::create();

        // And now, let's create a few articles in our database:
        for ($i = 0; $i < 50; $i++) {
            Article::create([
                'title' => $faker->sentence,
                'body' => $faker->paragraph,
            ]);
        }
    }
}
```

So let’s run the seed command:

    $ php artisan db:seed --class=ArticlesTableSeeder

Let’s repeat the process to create a Users seeder:

```php
class UsersTableSeeder extends Seeder
{
    public function run()
    {
        // Let's clear the users table first
        User::truncate();

        $faker = \Faker\Factory::create();

        // Let's make sure everyone has the same password and 
        // let's hash it before the loop, or else our seeder 
        // will be too slow.
        $password = Hash::make('toptal');

        User::create([
            'name' => 'Administrator',
            'email' => 'admin@test.com',
            'password' => $password,
        ]);

        // And now let's generate a few dozen users for our app:
        for ($i = 0; $i < 10; $i++) {
            User::create([
                'name' => $faker->name,
                'email' => $faker->email,
                'password' => $password,
            ]);
        }
    }
}
```

We can make it easier by adding our seeders to the main DatabaseSeeder class inside the database/seedsfolder:

```php
class DatabaseSeeder extends Seeder
{
    public function run()
    {
        $this->call(ArticlesTableSeeder::class);
        $this->call(UsersTableSeeder::class);
    }
}
```

This way, we can simply run \$ php artisan db:seed and it will run all the called classes in the run() method.

### 05. Routes and Controllers

Let’s create the basic endpoints for our application: create, retrieve the list, retrieve a single one, update, and delete. On the routes/api.php file, we can simply do this:

```php
Use App\Article;
 
Route::get('articles', function() {
    // If the Content-Type and Accept headers are set to 'application/json', 
    // this will return a JSON structure. This will be cleaned up later.
    return Article::all();
});
 
Route::get('articles/{id}', function($id) {
    return Article::find($id);
});

Route::post('articles', function(Request $request) {
    return Article::create($request->all);
});

Route::put('articles/{id}', function(Request $request, $id) {
    $article = Article::findOrFail($id);
    $article->update($request->all());

    return $article;
});

Route::delete('articles/{id}', function($id) {
    Article::find($id)->delete();

    return 204;
})
```

The routes inside api.php will be prefixed with /api/ and the API throttling middleware will be automatically applied to these routes (if you want to remove the prefix you can edit the RouteServiceProvider class on /app/Providers/RouteServiceProvider.php).

Now let’s move this code to its own Controller:

    $ php artisan make:controller ArticleController

ArticleController.php:

```php
use App\Article;
 
class ArticleController extends Controller
{
    public function index()
    {
        return Article::all();
    }
 
    public function show($id)
    {
        return Article::find($id);
    }

    public function store(Request $request)
    {
        return Article::create($request->all());
    }

    public function update(Request $request, $id)
    {
        $article = Article::findOrFail($id);
        $article->update($request->all());

        return $article;
    }

    public function delete(Request $request, $id)
    {
        $article = Article::findOrFail($id);
        $article->delete();

        return 204;
    }
}
```

The routes/api.php file:

```php
Route::get('articles', 'ArticleController@index');
Route::get('articles/{id}', 'ArticleController@show');
Route::post('articles', 'ArticleController@store');
Route::put('articles/{id}', 'ArticleController@update');
Route::delete('articles/{id}', 'ArticleController@delete');
```

We can improve the endpoints by using implicit route model binding. This way, Laravel will inject the Articleinstance in our methods and automatically return a 404 if it isn’t found. We’ll have to make changes on the routes file and on the controller:

```php
Route::get('articles', 'ArticleController@index');
Route::get('articles/{article}', 'ArticleController@show');
Route::post('articles', 'ArticleController@store');
Route::put('articles/{article}', 'ArticleController@update');
Route::delete('articles/{article}', 'ArticleController@delete');
```

```php
class ArticleController extends Controller
{
    public function index()
    {
        return Article::all();
    }

    public function show(Article $article)
    {
        return $article;
    }

    public function store(Request $request)
    {
        $article = Article::create($request->all());

        return response()->json($article, 201);
    }

    public function update(Request $request, Article $article)
    {
        $article->update($request->all());

        return response()->json($article, 200);
    }

    public function delete(Article $article)
    {
        $article->delete();

        return response()->json(null, 204);
    }
}
```

#### 1. A Note on HTTP Status Codes and the Response Format

We’ve also added the response()->json() call to our endpoints. This lets us explicitly return JSON data as well as send an HTTP code that can be parsed by the client. The most common codes you’ll be returning will be:

200: OK. The standard success code and default option.

201: Object created. Useful for the store actions.

204: No content. When an action was executed successfully, but there is no content to return.

206: Partial content. Useful when you have to return a paginated list of resources.

400: Bad request. The standard option for requests that fail to pass validation.

401: Unauthorized. The user needs to be authenticated.

403: Forbidden. The user is authenticated, but does not have the permissions to perform an action.

404: Not found. This will be returned automatically by Laravel when the resource is not found.

500: Internal server error. Ideally you're not going to be explicitly returning this, but if something unexpected breaks, this is what your user is going to receive.

503: Service unavailable. Pretty self explanatory, but also another code that is not going to be returned explicitly by the application.

#### 2. Sending a Correct 404 Response

If you tried to fetch a non-existent resource, you’ll be thrown an exception and you’ll receive the whole stacktrace, like this:

NotFoundHttpException Stacktrace

We can fix that by editing our exception handler class, located in app/Exceptions/Handler.php, to return a JSON response:

```php
public function render($request, Exception $exception)
{
    // This will replace our 404 response with
    // a JSON response.
    if ($exception instanceof ModelNotFoundException) {
        return response()->json([
            'error' => 'Resource not found'
        ], 404);
    }

    return parent::render($request, $exception);
}
```

Here’s an example of the return:

```php
{
    data: "Resource not found"
}
```

If you’re using Laravel to serve other pages, you have to edit the code to work with the Accept header, otherwise 404 errors from regular requests will return a JSON as well.

```php
public function render($request, Exception $exception)
{
    // This will replace our 404 response with
    // a JSON response.
    if ($exception instanceof ModelNotFoundException &&
        $request->wantsJson())
    {
        return response()->json([
            'data' => 'Resource not found'
        ], 404);
    }

    return parent::render($request, $exception);
}
```

In this case, the API requests will need the header Accept: application/json.

#### 3. Authentication

There are many ways to implement API Authentication in Laravel (one of them being Passport, a great way to implement OAuth2), but in this article, we’ll take a very simplified approach.

To get started, we’ll need to add an api_token field to the users table:

    $ php artisan make:migration --table=users adds_api_token_to_users_table

And then implement the migration:

```php
public function up()
{
    Schema::table('users', function (Blueprint $table) {
        $table->string('api_token', 60)->unique()->nullable();
    });
}

public function down()
{
    Schema::table('users', function (Blueprint $table) {
        $table->dropColumn(['api_token']);
    });
}
```

After that, just run the migration using:

    $ php artisan migrate

#### 4. Creating the Register Endpoint

We’ll make use of the RegisterController (in the Auth folder) to return the correct response upon registration. Laravel comes with authentication out of the box, but we still need to tweak it a bit to return the response we want.

If APIs were in English, this is what an api authentication conversation would sound like:

The controller makes use of the trait RegistersUsers to implement the registration. Here’s how it works:

```php
public function register(Request $request)
{
    // Here the request is validated. The validator method is located
    // inside the RegisterController, and makes sure the name, email
    // password and password_confirmation fields are required.
    $this->validator($request->all())->validate();

    // A Registered event is created and will trigger any relevant
    // observers, such as sending a confirmation email or any 
    // code that needs to be run as soon as the user is created.
    event(new Registered($user = $this->create($request->all())));

    // After the user is created, he's logged in.
    $this->guard()->login($user);

    // And finally this is the hook that we want. If there is no
    // registered() method or it returns null, redirect him to
    // some other URL. In our case, we just need to implement
    // that method to return the correct response.
    return $this->registered($request, $user)
                    ?: redirect($this->redirectPath());
}
```

We just need to implement the registered() method in our RegisterController. The method receives the \$request and the \$user, so that’s really all we want. Here’s how the method should look like inside the controller:

```php
protected function registered(Request $request, $user)
{
    $user->generateToken();

    return response()->json(['data' => $user->toArray()], 201);
}
```

And we can link it on the routes file:

    Route::post(register, 'Auth\RegisterController@register);

In the section above, we used a method on the User model to generate the token. This is useful so that we only have a single way of generating the tokens. Add the following method to your User model:

```php
class User extends Authenticatable
{
    ...
    public function generateToken()
    {
        $this->api_token = str_random(60);
        $this->save();

        return $this->api_token;
    }
}
```

And that’s it. The user is now registered and thanks to Laravel’s validation and out of the box authentication, the name, email, password, and password_confirmation fields are required, and the feedback is handled automatically. Checkout the validator() method inside the RegisterController to see how the rules are implemented.

Here’s what we get when we hit that endpoint:

```php
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/register \
 -H "Accept: application/json" \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -d '{"name": "John", "email": "john.doe@toptal.com", "password": "toptal123", "password_confirmation": "toptal123"}'
{
    "data": {
        "api_token":"0syHnl0Y9jOIfszq11EC2CBQwCfObmvscrZYo5o2ilZPnohvndH797nDNyAT",
        "created_at": "2017-06-20 21:17:15",
        "email": "john.doe@toptal.com",
        "id": 51,
        "name": "John",
        "updated_at": "2017-06-20 21:17:15"
    }
}
```
