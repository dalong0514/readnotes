## 0101Creation Ex Nihilo: Something from Nothing

Every civilization in the history of humanity has had its myth of creation. Humans have a deeply rooted and seemingly insatiable desire to understand not only their own origins but also the origins of other things around them. Most if not all of the myths since the dawn of man involve some kind of higher or supernatural beings which are intimately related to the existence and functioning of all things in the Universe. Modern man still holds a multitude of different views of the ultimate origin of the Universe, though a couple of the most well represented religions, Christianity and Islam, maintain that there was a single creator responsible for all that we see around us.

It is a predominant belief in Catholicism, accounting for about one-sixth of humanity, that the Creator achieved full creation of the Universe out of nothing – a belief that goes under the name of creation ex nihilo. (To be fair, not all Catholics believe this, but they ought to if they follow the Pope.) Postulating a supernatural being does not really help explain reality since then we only displace the question of the origins of reality to explaining the existence of the supernatural being. To this no religion offers any real answers.

If you think that scientists might have a vastly more insightful understanding of the origin of the Universe compared to that of major religions, then you'd better think again. Admittedly, most scientists are probably atheists (interestingly, more than 95% in the United Kingdom) but this does not necessarily mean that they do not hold some kind of a belief about what the Creation was like and where all this stuff around us comes from. The point is that, under all the postulates and axioms, if you dig far enough, you'll find that they are as stumped as anyone else. So, from the point of view of explaining why there is a reality and where it ultimately comes from, being religious or not makes absolutely no difference – we all end up with the same tricky question.

Every time I read a book on the religious or philosophical outlook of the world I cannot help but recognize many ideas in there as related to some ideas that we have in science. For example, the attitude of ‘reductionism' – the fact that we try to reduce everything to a single simple cause – is common to both a religious and scientific way of thinking. While methods of investigation can vary, in the same way that in religion we reduce everything to a common deity, in science we strive towards a unifying theory of everything. In fact this inherent desire to reduce the number of unknowns is prevalent in almost everything we do. Why should this be the case?

Often there are two different reasons given for this natural desire to simplify. First is that we as humans have a very limited imagination and whichever medium we use to understand the world – be it science, religion, philosophy, or art – we will end up exploiting the same limited set of ideas available to us. In other words, even as we begin to describe reality, the ideas that we use are not so different from one another. As an eminent American psychologist, Abraham Maslow, points out, when your only tool is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail. The hammer in our case could be our natural urge to find simple cause and effect relationships. We humans thrive on reducing complexity, finding it more beautiful and more believable to summarize our whole understanding ultimately in terms of one principle (whether it is a single god or a single theory of everything).

It is also important to appreciate that our reality, i.e. our view of the Universe, might be different from the actual Universe itself. We create our reality through our understanding of the Universe and our reality is what is possible based on everything we know. If we heed Maslow's words then we already understand that we are invariably limited, and accept that whatever reality we generate may only ever be an approximation to what the Universe is really like. In this sense, it is somewhat inevitable that as we build and then look to explain our reality, the singular thesis is somehow embedded within this; it is just a very comfortable notion for us to deal with.

Coupled to this, the second reason is that humans are also social beings. Artists, scientists, clergy, and the lay public all exchange ideas with one another, ideas which then feature in each other's work as we try to better understand our Universe, and generate our picture of reality. Notions of beauty and truth in one area inevitably affect ideas in another. With so many compelling arguments, it is perhaps no wonder then that we all follow more or less a similar road.

According to the German philosopher Ludwig Feuerbach, ‘Man first unconsciously and involuntarily creates God in his own image, and after this God consciously and voluntarily creates man in his own image'. If we take God as synonymous to reality, then reality and Man's perception of it are, in fact, inseparable. Man creates reality and then uses reality to describe himself. As we strive to reduce complexity, it is again unsurprising that we try to build our reality on the simplest possible causes.

A more optimistic view as to why our ideas somehow converge is that life has evolved in conjunction with the rest of the Universe. We are an embodiment of the same laws that have shaped the Universe and our imagination is intimately correlated to it. Consciously or subconsciously we find that we converge towards these laws. In this view the driver of this convergence, unlike in previous points, is not any limitation on our part to describe the Universe but rather a natural attraction towards the laws that bind it. These views may seem pretty similar, but the main difference is that the latter is more optimistic. Rather than us creating our reality and then only being able to describe the Universe through this reality, it essentially gives us hope that, as we embody the laws describing the Universe we are already on the right track. But will simplicity lie at the end of this journey?

One of the notions that scientists hold in highest esteem is Occam's razor. William of Occam, a fourteenth-century English logician and Franciscan friar, tells us that assumptions should not be multiplied without necessity, or in other words, the simplest explanation is usually best. While you could argue that simplicity is entirely subjective, in Chapter 10 I will show that there is an objective view of simplicity that is universal.

Taking Occam's logic to the extreme would also mean reducing all the explanation about everything in the Universe to a single all-encompassing principle. Imagine how easy this would make our lives; falling in love, the motion of planets, the movements of the stock market, all being explained through this one principle.

But is this really taking Occam to the extreme? Why not try to even get rid of this one principle and deduce everything without any principles? This surely is simpler still and therefore, in line with Occam's logic, must be a better reflection of reality? Deduction without any principles is what the famous American physicist John Wheeler called a ‘law without law'. He reasoned that if we can explain laws of physics without invoking any a priori laws of physics, then we would be in a good position to explain everything. It is this view that is the common scientific take on ‘creation out of nothing', creation ex nihilo.

Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, the famous German mathematician and philosopher and one of the inventors of the mathematical technique of calculus, used this logic in his proof of the existence of God. He found it surprising that something, rather than nothing, exists in the Universe, given that nothing is by far the simpler state. The only reason he could find for something to exist at all is that an independent being created that something. This for him was enough evidence to suggest an external influencer – the influencer being God. So even he, like many others, could find no better answer to the creation ex nihilo question than postulating a supernatural being.

The trickiness of having a law that explains everything without postulating a law (or some kind of general principle) in the first place was nicely addressed by one of Wheeler's students, Oxford physicist David Deutsch. On this issue Deutsch reasons as follows: ‘If there were no all-explanatory physical principle P approachable by the methods of science, this would presumably mean that there exist aspects of the natural world that are fundamentally inaccessible to science.' In other words, if we cannot find an overarching principle, then science cannot explain the Universe and fails in its ultimate objective. Deutsch reasons that any inability to explain the Universe through a single principle P would run directly counter to rationalism and ‘to our view of physics as the universal science, which has hitherto been the driving force behind progress in the subject and which we should be extremely reluctant to abandon'.

However, as Deutsch points out, the flip-side of this is also problematic. If there were such an all-explanatory principle P within physics, its origin would be forever insoluble, given that no principle (or law) can explain its own origin or form. It's like asking an air-conditioner ‘why are you an air-conditioner and not a chair?'. Clearly the answer lies outside of the air-conditioner, because the air-conditioner itself was just made that way. So, paradoxically, P, the ultimate principle of physics or the law that explains everything, just cannot be. Again its origin must lie outside of physics and hence Wheeler's seemingly self-contradictory expression ‘law without law'.

Deutsch's logic shows the fine line we have to walk if we are to try to explain the whole Universe from one single principle. But what exactly is it that this principle is trying to explain? Are we talking about explaining all objects in the Universe, such as chairs and air-conditioners; are we trying to explain social interactions such as falling in love; or are we talking about something more fundamental, like the basic building blocks of matter and their interactions? Surely we need to explain all of this, the origin of all the stuff in the Universe and how it's tied together.

This book will argue that information (and not matter or energy or love) is the building block on which everything is constructed. Information is far more fundamental than matter or energy because it can be successfully applied to both macroscopic interactions, such as economic and social phenomena, and, as I will argue, information can also be used to explain the origin and behaviour of microscopic interactions such as energy and matter.

As pointed out by Deutsch and Wheeler, however, whatever candidate is proposed for the fundamental building block of the Universe, it still needs to explain its ‘own' ultimate origin too. In other words, the question of everything from nothing, creation ex nihilo, is key. So if, as I claim, information is this common thread, the question of creation ex nihilo reduces to explaining how some information arises out of no information. Not only will I show how this is possible, I will also argue that information, in contrast to matter and energy, is the only concept that we currently have that can explain its own origin.

So does information also help us find the all-explanatory principle, P, discussed by Deutsch? I argue in the third part of this book that when viewing reality in terms of information, this question no longer even makes any sense. We find that the journey itself, in this case the method with which useful information arises, becomes more important than the ultimate destination (the concept of an explanatory physical law). Indeed we question whether there is any ultimate destination at all, or whether, as the Universe evolves, then so does our target, firmly placing the concept of an ultimate physical principle only in our created reality rather than as a necessary construct for the Universe itself.

So what is the important question that we must address? If we agree on information as a natural framework within which to understand our reality, then we should be able to explain all natural phenomena in terms of it. This is the subject of the core of this book, Chapters 3–10. As we go through the chapters, we will see that it is actually the decrease of information that equates to a better understanding of it. Though this might sound odd initially, intuitively we know this to be true – in that when we understand something better we find that we can summarize it within a few basic principles. For example, instead of having 100 different laws to describe the dynamics of a tennis ball being thrown into the air, each law applicable under a different set of conditions, having one law capturing any possible condition is something that we feel gives us a much better understanding. Hence we equate a better understanding of our reality with a compression of the amount of information that it contains.

Conversely, whilst we work tirelessly to reduce the amount of information in our reality, there is a fundamental argument that suggests that the amount of information in the Universe as a whole, if understood correctly, can only ever increase. This is the subject of Chapter 5. This implies that as the Universe reveals more and more to us, our reality of what is and isn't possible consequently grows, leading to more information that then needs to be compressed. The analogy that I often like to give is of a donkey with a carrot hanging at a fixed distance in front of it. As the donkey moves closer to the carrot, thinking he's almost made it, the carrot moves in line with the donkey. The donkey, not realizing that the carrot is attached to it via a stick, continues to try and try, unaware that he is ultimately doomed to failure (it is a donkey after all). While he covers a lot of distance (and gets to know the structure of the carrot intimately), the donkey ultimately fails in his primary objective.

In this sense there is a dichotomy between our desire to compress information (distil our whole understanding of reality into a few encompassing principles) and the natural increase of information in the Universe (the total amount we need to understand). This desire to compress information and the natural increase of information in the Universe may initially seem like independent processes, but as we will explore in much more detail later there may be a connection. As we compress and find all-encompassing principles describing our reality, it is these principles that then indicate how much more information there is in our Universe to find. In the same way that Feuerbach states that ‘Man first creates God, and then God creates Man', we can say that we compress information into laws from which we construct our reality, and this reality then tells us how to further compress information.

While some may disagree, I believe this view of reality being defined through information compression is closer to the spirit of science as well as its practice (the so-called scientific method to be discussed in great detail in Chapters 10 and 12). It is also closer to the scientific meaning of information in that information reflects the degree of uncertainty in our knowledge of a system, as will be shown in Chapter 3.

Perhaps the view of the Universe that will be promoted here should more appropriately be called ‘annihilation of everything' as opposed to ‘creation out of nothing', as ultimately it is compression that we argue defines reality. This will be explained in more detail in Part Three of the book.

从虚无创生

在人类历史长河中，每个文明都有其独特的创世神话。人类对理解自身起源以及周遭万物本源的探索欲望根深蒂固且永无止境。自人类文明伊始，绝大多数神话都涉及某种超然存在，这种存在与宇宙万物的存在和运作紧密相连。即使在现代，人们对宇宙终极起源仍持有诸多不同观点，其中最具影响力的宗教如基督教和伊斯兰教，都认为存在一个创造了世间万物的唯一造物主。

在天主教信仰中（约占全人类的六分之一），普遍接受「从无创造」（creation ex nihilo）的信念 —— 即造物主从虚无中创造了整个宇宙。（诚然，并非所有天主教徒都认同这一观点，但如果要严格遵循教皇的教义，他们就应该接受这一信念。）然而，假设存在超自然力量并不能从根本上解释现实的本质，因为这只是将现实起源的问题转化为另一个问题：超自然存在本身从何而来。对于这个问题，所有宗教都无法给出令人信服的答案。

如果你认为科学家对宇宙起源的认知远超宗教的解释，那可能需要重新思考这个判断。确实，大多数科学家都是无神论者（值得注意的是，在英国这一比例超过 95%），但这并不意味着他们对宇宙的创生过程和万物本源没有自己的理论假设。关键在于，当我们深入探讨所有科学假设和公理的根源时，会发现科学家们同样面临着认知的局限。因此，在解释现实的存在及其终极来源这个问题上，无论是否持有宗教信仰都无关紧要 —— 我们都在面对同样的终极难题。

每当我阅读关于宗教或哲学世界观的著作时，总能发现其中许多理念与科学理论存在着关联。例如，「还原主义」（Reductionism）—— 即试图将复杂现象归结为单一简单原因的思维方式 —— 在宗教和科学的思维模式中都普遍存在。尽管探究方法各异，但正如宗教将万物归于一个共同的神祇，科学也在追求一个统一的理论来解释一切。事实上，这种将复杂性简化的倾向几乎贯穿于人类所有的认知活动中。这种普遍现象的深层原因值得我们深入探讨。

对于人类这种追求简化的本能，学界通常提出两种解释。第一种解释认为，人类的想象力本质上是有限的，无论我们通过什么方式 —— 科学、宗教、哲学还是艺术 —— 来认知世界，最终都会局限于我们所能获取的有限思维模式。换言之，即使在开始描述现实时，我们运用的概念之间也往往存在着内在的相似性。正如美国著名心理学家亚伯拉罕·马斯洛（Abraham Maslow）所说：「当你手中只有一把锤子时，眼中所有问题都像钉子。」在我们讨论的情境中，这把「锤子」可能就是人类寻找简单因果关系的认知倾向。人类天生就倾向于化繁为简，我们更容易接受并相信那些能够用单一原理（无论是唯一的神还是统一的科学理论）来诠释一切的解释。

还有一个重要认识是，我们所理解的现实（即我们对宇宙的认知）可能与宇宙的本来面目有所差异。我们是通过对宇宙的理解来构建我们的现实认知的，这种现实认知建立在我们已知知识的基础之上。如果我们认同马斯洛的观点，就会意识到人类认知的固有局限性，并接受我们所建构的任何现实模型可能永远只是宇宙真实本质的近似表征。从这个角度来看，当我们建立并试图解释我们的现实时，追求单一解释原理的倾向实际上已经深深植入了这个过程；这种追求统一性的思维模式已经成为人类认知的基本特征。

第二个原因在于人类的社会属性。艺术家、科学家、宗教学者和普通民众之间不断进行着思想交流，这些观念在他们试图理解宇宙和构建现实认知的过程中相互影响和渗透。一个领域中关于美与真理的认识必然会影响其他领域的思维方式。正是由于存在如此多相互关联的理论基础，我们在探索真理的道路上往往会不约而同地选择相似的方向。

德国哲学家路德维希·费尔巴哈（Ludwig Feuerbach）曾说：「人类首先在潜意识中依据自身形象创造上帝，而后这个上帝又有意识地按其形象塑造人类」。如果我们将「上帝」理解为「现实」，那么现实与人类对现实的认知就形成了一个不可分割的整体。

还有一种更具启发性的观点认为，人类思维的某种趋同性源自于生命与宇宙的共同演化。我们是宇宙基本规律的具象化体现，我们的想象力与宇宙本质有着内在联系。不管是否意识到这一点，我们的认知都自然而然地向这些基本规律靠拢。在这种观点看来，思维的趋同并非源自人类认知的局限性，而是来自于对宇宙基本规律的自然契合。这两种观点表面上相似，但后者显然更具建设性。它不是简单地认为我们创造了自己的现实认知模式，然后被限制在这个模式中来理解宇宙，而是给予我们一种希望 —— 作为宇宙规律的体现者，我们的认知探索已经走在正确的道路上。但问题是，在这条探索之路的尽头，是否真的存在着我们所期待的简单性呢？

在科学界最受推崇的原则之一是奥卡姆剃刀原理（Occam's Razor）。14 世纪英国逻辑学家和方济各会修士威廉·奥卡姆（William of Occam）提出，在没有必要的情况下不应增加假设，也就是说，在解释力相同的情况下，越简单的理论越可能是正确的。虽然有人可能认为「简单性」是一个主观概念，但我将在第 10 章中阐述，存在一种客观且具有普遍性的简单性衡量标准。

如果将奥卡姆原理的逻辑推至极致，就意味着要将宇宙中所有现象的解释归结为一个统一的基本原理。设想一下，如果能实现这一点，人类情感、天体运动、经济变化等所有现象都可以用这一原理来解释，这将是多么令人振奋的突破。

但是，这样的思路真的是对奥卡姆原理的极致运用吗？为什么不更进一步，尝试完全摒弃任何预设原理，直接从零推导一切呢？这种方式显然更加简单，按照奥卡姆原理的逻辑，应该能更好地反映现实本质。这种不依赖任何预设原理的推导方式，就是著名美国物理学家约翰·惠勒（John Wheeler）所说的「无法则的法则」（law without law）。他认为，如果我们能够不借助任何先验的物理定律就能解释物理规律的存在，那么我们就能真正理解万物的本质。这种观点代表了「从虚无创生」（creation ex nihilo）的科学诠释。

德国著名数学家和哲学家、微积分的奠基人之一戈特弗里德·威廉·莱布尼茨（Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz）在论证上帝存在时运用了类似的逻辑。他认为，既然虚无状态是最简单的，那么宇宙中实际存在物质这一事实就显得格外值得深思。他认为，唯一能解释物质存在的原因就是必然存在一个独立的创造者。对他而言，这足以证明存在一个外部创造者 —— 也就是上帝。因此，即便是像他这样的科学家，也和许多人一样，在解释「从无到有」这个根本问题时，仍不得不求助于超自然存在的假设。

关于如何在不预设任何基本定律或普遍原理的情况下解释一切的这个复杂问题，惠勒的学生、牛津物理学家大卫·多伊奇（David Deutsch）提出了独到的见解。他这样论述道：「如果不存在一个能通过科学方法探索的统一解释原理 P，这就意味着自然界中存在某些本质上超出科学认知范畴的领域。」换言之，如果我们找不到这样一个统一原理，那么科学就无法完整解释宇宙，也就无法实现其终极目标。多伊奇认为，任何否认通过单一原理 P 来解释宇宙可能性的观点，都直接违背了理性主义精神，也违背了「物理学作为普遍科学的地位 —— 这一直是推动物理学发展的核心动力，我们绝不应轻易放弃这一信念」。

然而，正如多伊奇指出的，这个问题还有另一个同样具有挑战性的维度。如果物理学中确实存在这样一个统一解释原理 P，那么这个原理本身的起源就将成为一个永远无法解答的谜题，因为任何原理（或定律）都无法自我解释其起源或形式。这就像询问一个物体为何具有其特定属性而非其他属性一样，答案必然存在于该物体之外，因为物体的属性是在其被创造时确定的。因此，我们面临一个悖论：作为物理学终极法则的统一原理 P，从本质上来说是不可能存在的。它的起源必然超出物理学的范畴，这就是为什么惠勒提出了看似自相矛盾的「无法则的法则」这一概念。

多伊奇的论述揭示了一个深刻的洞见：如果我们试图用单一原理来解释整个宇宙，就必须在各种概念边界之间谨慎平衡。但这里产生了一个关键问题：这个统一原理究竟要解释什么？是要解释宇宙中所有具体事物的存在，还是要解释各种社会现象，抑或是要探究更基础的层面，比如物质的基本组成单元及其相互作用？显然，我们需要解释所有这些问题，包括宇宙中一切事物的起源及其内在联系。

本书将论证：信息（而非物质、能量或其他任何概念）才是构成万物的基本要素。信息比物质或能量更为基础，因为它不仅可以有效解释宏观层面的经济和社会互动现象，而且正如本书将要论证的，它还可以用来阐释微观层面的能量和物质的本质及其行为规律。

然而，正如多伊奇和惠勒所指出的，无论我们认定什么是宇宙的基本构成要素，我们仍然需要解释它「自身」的终极来源。换言之，「从虚无中创生」（creation ex nihilo）这一根本问题至关重要。因此，如果如我所主张的，信息是贯穿万物的基础概念，那么「从虚无创生」的问题就转化为：如何从「无信息」状态中产生信息。在接下来的论述中，我不仅会证明这种可能性的存在，更会说明为什么信息，与物质和能量相比，是目前唯一一个能够自我解释其起源的基本概念。

那么，信息概念是否也能帮助我们找到多伊奇所讨论的统一解释原理 P 呢？在本书第三部分，我将论证：当我们从信息的视角来审视现实时，这个问题本身就失去了其原有意义。我们发现，探索的过程本身 —— 即探索有效信息产生机制的方法 —— 比最终目标（即建立统一的物理定律）更具有本质意义。实际上，我们需要思考的是：是否真的存在某个终极目标？还是说，随着宇宙的演化，我们的认知目标也在不断演进？这种思考将使我们认识到，终极物理原理的概念也许仅存在于人类构建的认知框架中，而非宇宙本体所必需的属性。

那么，我们真正需要探讨的核心问题是什么？如果我们承认信息是理解现实的基本范式，那么我们就应该能够用信息来解释所有自然现象。这正是本书核心章节（第 3-10 章）要探讨的主题。在这些章节中，我们将看到一个看似矛盾但深刻的现象：信息的简化实际上意味着对其理解的深化。这种表述乍看可能有些违反常理，但这恰恰反映了科学认知的本质 —— 当我们对某个现象有了更深入的理解时，往往能够用更少的基本原理来概括它。

举个例子，用一个统一的物理定律来描述抛物运动，使其能适用于所有可能的条件，显然比使用 100 个仅适用于特定条件的不同定律更能体现我们对这一现象的深入理解。这说明，对现实的更深层理解往往体现为信息的有效压缩。

然而，这里存在一个有趣的悖论：当我们努力简化和压缩我们对现实的认知时，从宇宙整体的角度来看，其信息总量实际上只会增加，这一观点将在第 5 章详细讨论。这意味着，随着我们对宇宙的认识不断深入，我们对「可能」与「不可能」的认知范围也在不断扩大，这就产生了更多需要压缩的信息。这种现象让我想到一个形象的比喻：一头驴子面前悬挂着一根固定距离的胡萝卜。每当驴子觉得要接近胡萝卜时，胡萝卜就会随之移动保持距离。驴子不知道胡萝卜其实是通过杆子固定在自己身上的，于是不断尝试去够取，而这注定是无法实现的目标。尽管在这个过程中，驴子走过了漫长的距离（也对胡萝卜有了全面的认识），但最终仍无法实现其最初的目标。

这样，我们就看到了一个有趣的对立：一方面是我们试图通过几个统一原理来压缩和概括我们对现实的理解，另一方面是宇宙本身信息总量的不断增长。这两个看似相互独立的过程 —— 信息压缩的愿望与信息自然增长的趋势 —— 实际上可能存在深层联系，这一点我们将在后文详细探讨。当我们通过压缩信息发现描述现实的基本原理时，正是这些原理揭示了宇宙中还有多少信息等待我们去发现。这让我想起费尔巴哈（Feuerbach）的观点：「人类创造上帝，而后上帝塑造人类」。同样地，我们将信息压缩为基本定律来构建现实认知，而这种认知又指引我们如何进一步压缩和理解信息。

虽然这种观点可能存在争议，但我认为通过信息压缩来定义现实的方法更符合科学的本质和实践特征（这种科学方法论将在第 10 章和第 12 章中详细阐述）。这种方法也更贴近信息的科学内涵，因为信息本质上反映了我们对系统认知的不确定性水平，这一点将在第 3 章中具体讨论。

也许本书提出的宇宙观应该被称为「归于简约」（annihilation of everything），而不是「从虚无创生」（creation ex nihilo），因为我们最终论证信息的压缩才是定义现实的本质。这一观点将在本书第三部分中得到深入阐述。

### Key points

We present the notion of our reality, which is our understanding of the Universe and what is and is not possible within it. Our notion of reality continually evolves with our progress.

We wrestle with the challenge of whether there could be an ultimate law that describes the Universe and the question of how this could arise out of nothingness, creation ex nihilo.

This book will argue that information is the underlying thread that connects all phenomena we see around us as well as explaining their origin. Our reality is ultimately made up of information.

主要论点：

本书提出了一个现实认知的框架，这个框架体现了我们对宇宙的理解以及对可能与不可能的边界的认知。这种认知框架随着科学进步不断演进。

我们探讨了两个根本性问题：是否存在一个能够描述整个宇宙的终极定律，以及这样的定律如何能从虚无中产生（creation ex nihilo）。

本书将论证：信息是连接和解释所有自然现象及其本源的基础概念。我们所认知的现实本质上是信息的构型与表现。
