## NOTES

Chapters 1–2

E.J. Larson and L. Witham, Scientists are still keeping the faith, Nature, 386, 435 (1997). This article presents some statistics on religion among scientists. Though one has to be careful with such statistics, as depending on the exact wording the responses can be quite different. For example, the questions ‘Do you believe in God?', or ‘Do you believe in a supernatural being?' or simply ‘Are you religious?' could (and do) all lead to different statistics of answers.

I. Calvino, Castle of Crossed Destinies (Vintage Classics, 1997). A creative parable on life by one of the foremost Italian writers. Calvino's card game is used as the main metaphor in my book, in terms of how we gain knowledge and better understand our reality. Various writers have provided different metaphors for life, in terms of games that we play; however Calvino's card game for me is richer and more insightful.

W. Poundstone, Recursive Universe (William Morrow, 1984). One of the first popular books to argue for the digital view of the Universe in a very eloquent and general way. As far as I am aware, the first person to think of the Universe as a gigantic information processor was a Polish computer scientist, Konrad Zuse, whose mathematics was instrumental for the Allied code-breaking activities in World War II. Unfortunately though, he never wrote any accessible account of it. Other notable protagonists include Tommaso Toffoli and Edward Fredkin.

Chapter 3

S. Wrathmell, Leeds (Pevsner Architectural Guides, Yale University Press 2008). An excellent guide to the architectural and cultural heritage of Leeds, UK, my home town between 2004 and 2009.

J.R. Pierce, Information, Signals, Noise (Dover, 1973). Pierce has written the best accessible account of information theory I am aware of. This requires some basic knowledge of mathematics, but only very basic! I strongly encourage you to read it if you are interested in delving deeper into elements of the information theory presented in this book.

C.E. Shannon and W. Weaver, The Mathematical Theory of Communication (University of Illinois Press, 1948). The Bible of information theory. The book contains both Shannon's original paper as well as a commentary by Weaver.

E.C. Cherry, A history of the theory of information, Proceedings of the Institute of Electrical Engineering, 98, 383 (1951). My account was really just geared towards explaining the established theory of information, beginning with Shannon. This work however explains in great detail the history of the basic ideas that led to this established theory. A shorter review, with somewhat different emphasis, is by J.R. Pierce, The early days of information theory, IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 19, 3 (1973).

Chapter 4

J. von Neumann, Theory of Self-Reproducing Automata, edited and compiled by Arthur W. Burks (University of Illinois Press, 1963). After writing pioneering treatises in economics, quantum physics, and mathematics, von Neumann then turned his attention to biologically inspired questions. This book contains the original exposition of von Neumann's ideas about replication. Like most of von Neumann's work, a good read for the more mathematically astute readers.

E. Schrödinger, What is Life? (Cambridge University Press, 1946). A beautifully written popularization of physics, with emphasis on implications for biology. It is still highly recommended, even though many ideas there have since been surpassed.

J. Monod, Chance and Necessity (Vintage, 1971). This book views life as consisting of reproductions of Maxwell's demons. Passionately argued, and beautifully explained, by a Nobel Laureate in biology.

Chapter 5

B. Russell, Free Man's Worship (Routledge, 1976). In the agnostic tradition of Thomas Henry Huxley, Russell explains what a free person should and should not accept in the light of scientific knowledge. This contains the quote of Russell on the faith scientists and philosophers have in the Second Law of thermodynamics.

P. Atkins, Creation (Oxford University Press, 1978). This book beautifully argues how the tendency to chaos captured by the Second Law is in fact the main driving force behind evolution. Far from contradicting it, disorder generates life – which could be viewed as an oasis in the sea of chaos. The book is also notable for trying to provide a physical creation of the Universe out of nothing. But, as I argue in my book, this picture lacks the crucial concept of information that permeates all phenomena. This is the book Richard Dawkins said was the best popular science book ever written!

T. Norretranders, The User Illusion: Cutting Consciousness Down to Size (Penguin Press Science, 1998). This book contains a detailed description of Maxwell's demon paradox and its consequences for computation. It is otherwise one of the best attempts so far to understand consciousness in terms of information theory. According to Norretranders our brain makes representations of reality as images in our head. One aspect of this reality is ourselves and the evolving image of ourselves is, briefly speaking, our mind. The ‘user illusion' in the title refers to the fact that the computer also creates an illusion of itself in order for us to find it user-friendly. So we think of computers as desktops with files, folders, programs, routines, etc. However, all a computer does is simply crunching of zeros and ones. Nowhere inside any computers do folders exist or programs or files – this is just an interface for us. Our consciousness likewise offers us an interface of ourselves. This is all there is to mind, is what the book claims.

Chapter 6

R.J. Kelly, A new interpretation of information rate, Bell Systems Technical Journal, 35, 916 (1956). This is the first application of Shannon's theory and it is to gambling. One of its striking features is that no ‘error correction' is necessary in order to reach the maximum capacity (in this case the maximum financial gain).

E.O. Thorp, The Mathematics of Gambling. Notes based on Thorp's preparation and experience in the Las Vegas casinos. Written in a very simple language and accessible online to a wide audience.

K. Sigmund, Games of Life (Oxford University Press, 1993). If you were fascinated by the analogy of betting in a casino, with organisms betting against the environment to survive, then this is an excellent popular book outlining the role of game theory in biology in a much more general context.

Chapter 7

T. Harford, The Logic of Life (Little Brown, 2008). Contains a section discussing Schelling's basic ideas. The whole book is beautifully written and examines various general issues from the perspective of an economist.

M. Buchanan, Nexus: Small Worlds and the Groundbreaking Science of Networks (W.W. Norton, 2002). This is a good up-to-date popular account of modern mathematical methods in sociology. Buchanan is a journalist and this is a very accessible introduction. If you want something a little more detailed, then I would recommend A.-L. Barabási, Linked: The New Science of Networks (Plume, 2003). Barabási is a scientific researcher who has contributed a great deal to studying physical properties of general networks.

J.E. Stiglitz, Globalization and Its Discontents (W.W. Norton, 2003). Here is a book describing the socio-economic implications of globalization. Stiglitz, an economics Nobel Laureate, is careful to point out the pros and cons as well as to offer advice on how to direct the globalizing trend towards the greater good of everyone, rather than increase the gap between the haves and have-nots. He does not talk about any connections with information theory though.

T.L. Friedman, The World is Flat (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2005). A personal account of a journalist of what it means to have a very inter-connected world. ‘Flatness' in the title refers exactly to the fact that everyone is connected to everyone else and all changes propagate at a very high speed. A personal account of interconnectedness in the world, again without any use of information theory.

Chapter 8

W. Heisenberg, Physics and Philosophy (George Allen and Unwin, 1959). An excellent account of the basic tenets of quantum mechanics and how it changed the whole classical philosophy. Written by one of its pioneers, it is a tour de force.

B. Clegg, The God Effect (St. Martin's Press, 2006). This book contains a very accessible introduction to the recent work on entanglement, both theoretical and experimental. Highly recommended to all those interested in an up-to-date understanding of quantum mechanics.

S. Singh, The Code Book (Fourth Estate, 2000). A popular book explaining cryptography within the historical setting. Many intriguing examples are presented. The author also reviews the basics of quantum cryptography.

Chapter 9

D. Deutsch, The Fabric of Reality (Allen Lane, The Penguin Press, 1997). A very creative account of our current understanding of reality through four pillars of knowledge: quantum physics, biology of the selfish gene, Popper's conjectures and refutations, and Turing's theory of universal computation.

H. Everett, Relative State Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics (Princeton University Press, 1973). The first application of Shannon's information theory to quantum mechanics. For Everett, measurement results are in fact stored in the correlations between the observers and the observed. The correlations are measured using Shannon's formula. The overall state of the Universe is presented as a huge combination of correlated states between different subsystems. What matters is the state of one relative to another, hence the title of Everett's thesis. This relational view of the Universe forms the basis for the view I offer in the last chapter of the book.

G.R. Fleming and G.D. Scholes, Physical chemistry: Quantum mechanics for plants, Nature, 431, 256 (2004). A friendly, semi-popular one-page piece on the potential importance of quantum effects in biology. This is now a growing area of research.

Chapter 10

P. Watson, Ideas (Phoenix, 2005). A recent book arguing that there are three key ideas in the development of Western civilization. The scientific method, or method of conjectures and refutations, is one of them.

M. Schroeder, Fractals, Chaos, Power Laws: Minutes from an Infinite Paradise (W.H. Freeman, 1992). Schroeder is brilliant at conveying simple ideas behind randomness in an exciting way so that even the expert remains entertained. Highly recommended.

K. Popper, Conjectures and Refutations (Routledge, 2002). Popper is the most-liked philosopher by scientists because he clarified and defended the method by which scientists gain knowledge.

G. Chaitin, Collection of Essays (World Scientific, 2007). Essays mainly on the topic of viewing randomness in an information theoretic way. Closely related to the work of R. Solomonoff, A formal theory of inductive inference, Information and Control, 7, 1 (1964).

V. Vedral, 50th Anniversary Issue of the New Scientist (18 Nov. 2006). My invited essay on determinism versus randomness from the physics perspective. Some parts of this chapter are based on this essay.

Chapter 11

Archimedes, The Sand Reckoner (a translation can be found on the web). An essay with a very visionary calculation undertaken by the Ancient Greek mathematician (Archimedes usually features with Gauss and Newton in the top three mathematical geniuses of all time). He offers to the then king of Syracuse the reasoning behind his estimate of the size of the Universe. He puts it in terms of the number of grains of sand (probably what was thought to be the smallest object at that time) that can fit within the Universe. It is intriguing to read how he enumerates large numbers. Remember that the Greeks didn't have the concept of zero. So he could not write 1000,000 to represent a million!

L. Smolin, Three Roads to Quantum Gravity (Basic Books, 2002). A good popular account of the Bekenstein bound and the relationship between entropy and area.

J. Barbour, The End of Time (Oxford University Press, 2001). This book argues that since all meaning lies in connections between events, time itself does not exist. That is, it does not exist over and above the correlations. Paraphrasing it in the spirit of the current book, time is just the amount of correlations between things in the Universe. The book is based on a well-known paper by D.N. Page and W.K. Wootters, Physical Review D, 27, 2885 (1983).

Chapter 12

D. Turner, The Darkness of God (Cambridge University Press, 1995). This book explains the basics of medieval Christian mysticism. Contrary to what we perceive mysticism to be today, the medieval Christian variant was very rational and against the so-called ‘mystical experiences' as necessary to reach God. The key was a consistent application of the Negative Way, a method they invented that has similarities with the scientific method.

C.G. Jung, Synchronicity – An Acausal Connecting Principle (Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1972). This essay tries to argue that events that are thought to be random, yet occur simultaneously, are connected by an additional principle that goes beyond the scientific principle of causality. Some of Jung's patients were quantum physicists (Wolfgang Pauli, one of the discoverers of quantum physics, was the most prominent one) so Jung was quite familiar with the fact that chance plays a key role in modern physics. It is interesting to see how he navigates his way between blind chance and overpowering determinism.

O. Ulfbeck and A. Bohr, Genuine fortuitousness. Where did that click come from?, Foundations of physics, 11, 757 (2001). Here the authors argue that randomness has to be acknowledged as fundamental in quantum physics which means that the link between cause and effect is necessarily severed. As a natural consequence, clicks in detectors are fortuitous and cannot be attributed to the underlying existence of particles. This point of view is discussed at length in the final chapter of the book.

V. Vedral, Is reality a quantum hocus pocus?, Straits Times, 23 February 2008. This is the first place where I described the quantum game of cards. The game itself was introduced to me by my friend Janet Anders, a physicist at University College, London. Another similar representation of quantum physics in terms of games is to relate it to the ‘game of twenty questions', as first done by Wheeler. The idea here is for one person to imagine an object and for another to guess the object by asking ‘yes/no' questions. ‘Is it small?', or ‘Is it material?' and so on . . . As the questions proceed, the guesser narrows down the range of possibilities and is, after twenty questions, in a good position to give the right answer. The quantum analogy arises by changing the game so that the first person does not imagine anything initially and then evolves an image through being consistent with his answers to the twenty questions asked. This, of course, makes it difficult for the guesser, but, if the questions are skilfully chosen, could still lead to very little choice in the end.
