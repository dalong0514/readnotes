## PART TWO

Up until now we have been discussing various aspects of reality in terms of information. We have seen how information theory provides a powerful description of various different aspects of reality. In deriving his theory, Shannon was just trying to describe information in terms of a very specific problem, that of communication between two parties, Alice and Bob. He didn't care a jot about the applicability of his theory beyond that problem, but as it turns out this is exactly where the power of his theory lies. Did Shannon get lucky or is there something more fundamental about his approach that makes information theory so widely applicable?

At its core, information theory asks the most fundamental question that can be asked: Is event A different (distinguishable) from event B? But why is this so fundamental, you may ask? Well, think of it this way; try to imagine learning or describing anything where you cannot distinguish between the correct answer and an incorrect answer. It cannot be done! You are essentially blind. Without distinguishability we cannot hope to have any understanding of our Universe if everything looks identical. If we consider the first half of this book we have already seen this concept of distinguishability applied in many different guises. In biology for example, DNA distinguishes between four bases to replicate itself. In thermodynamics, Maxwell's Demon needs to distinguish between fast-moving and slow-moving particles in order to create a temperature differences between two sides of a container. In a casino, you're betting on at least two different scenarios and it is your understanding of the probabilities that determines your profit. In sociology we were making a distinction between whether an individual is liberal or not, which has an impact on how likely it is that you stay in your neighborhood.

This fundamental concept of distinguishability between two different states is basically what Shannon referred to as a bit of information. A bit is the most fundamental measure of information; where you have more than two outcomes, you simply use more bits to distinguish them all.

Of course it makes no sense to talk about the distinguishability of two events if only one of the events ever occurs. Therefore we also need to know the probability with which each of the events occur. Because we can distinguish between more than one outcome, time after time, we can then generate the probabilities for these outcomes. The probability of an event gives us the expectation of an event occurring, and this is what allows us to quantify how surprised we are when the event happens. If we are expecting something with high probability we are not so surprised when it happens (e.g. the Sun rises) and when it doesn't happen, we are a little more surprised.

All of this is so natural and basic that even if you sat in your armchair and thought about it (albeit with a fair modicum of hindsight) you find yourself leaning towards a similar framework to that which Shannon proposed. From this perspective, I think you'd agree that Shannon's concept of information seems quite intuitive.

So are we done? Armed with Shannon's information theory can we now generalize any problem in terms of information? Well, not quite. While the key to wide applicability of Shannon's information theory is that it has the same logical foundation as our everyday physical, biological, social, and economical phenomena, it doesn't quite capture everything. Shannon's information theory boils down to events based on Boolean logic, i.e. for an event with several outcomes, each outcome happens or does not happen – if you roll a die you can either get 3 or not (you can't roll a 3 and a 6 at the same time). Note that though this logical foundation seems an entirely trivial truism to the reader, we will see that our latest understanding of the Universe tells us otherwise.

This event-based Boolean logic is also very characteristic of the early models of physics. In the same way that Shannon's information theory is based on the fundamental idea of a definite outcome (we only expect to see event A or event B occurring, but never the two together), our early physical models follow suit. The early models of physics, usually called classical or sometimes Newtonian physics, are also responsible for the vast majority of our technological progress to date (think: electromagnetism, energy manipulation, hydrodynamics, and telecommunications). It is the kind of physics that we studied at school, where each particle has a well-defined charge, position, velocity, and mass. Classical physics argues that if we knew these properties for all the particles in the Universe, we could determine the outcome of any future event, in other words the Universe is fully deterministic. In fact there has been an imaginary creature conceived for this very purpose. Laplace's demon, as he is affectionately referred to, knows all the properties for each and every particle in the Universe and as such is able to determine any event (akin to being able to see into the future). To this demon, the concept of information is completely redundant, he has no need for it – as the demon already knows with certainty what will occur. What a boring Universe this demon lives in. Samuel Johnson would agree: ‘such is the state of life that none are happy but by the anticipation of change'.

Fortunately, though, even if this deterministic Universe is boring and predictable to Laplace's demon, scientific progress, and physics in particular, is still full of surprises. Physics is a very dynamic activity, and as soon as we are set on a model to describe reality, along comes an experiment that completely challenges our view. In this way, physics evolves through time, taking into account more and more information, new experiments and insights to produce a better and better description of reality. So the question is, what has made classical physics ‘classical'? I mean who's the new kid on the block?

Our latest understanding is that certain aspects of reality are more accurately described by a higher approximation of physics known as ‘quantum theory'. With quantum theory the notion of a deterministic Universe fails, events always occur with probabilities regardless of how much information you have. Hence Laplace's demon cannot even exist in principle, let alone in practice (i.e. there is no truth in a crystal ball or the Greek oracle at Delphi). It is not just physics that is full of surprises, the Universe intrinsically is full of surprises.

So what does our new understanding of physics, the introduction of quantum theory, mean for Shannon's information theory? Shannon didn't build his information theory to include the oddity of quantumness, so if we are really to describe the whole Universe, does the fundamentality of Shannon's information theory still hold? Yes, but with a twist. Distinguishability and probabilities are still central even in quantum theory, however the concept of distinguishability needs to be enlarged to account for the bizarreness of quantum effects. And, when we expand Shannon's information theory, we find that there are many additional elements of reality that had been completely hidden from us.

In the second part of this book we present and apply an enlarged information theory, quantum information theory, to present a number of novel features that couldn't be described purely by Shannon's information theory. Quantum information theory can be approximated by Shannon's information theory in certain cases, including the cases covered in the first part of the book. In the second part of the book we no longer have this luxury; a full quantum exposition is necessary. This leads us to some fascinating new features of information processing, such as the ability to teleport information across vast distances, the ability to compute faster than we ever thought imaginable, and to communicate so securely that no amount of eavesdropping or computing power can ever decipher our communications. However, the real surprise is how our understanding of the Universe is dramatically shaken and leads us to find new insight into its very origin.

Former US Secretary of State, Donald Rumsfeld, unbeknown to him, paraphrases the transformation from Shannon's to quantum information theory beautifully when he tells us that some of the unknown unknowns have now become known unknowns or even known knowns. This does not exclude the fact that there may be many more unknown unknowns, i.e. we still don't know what we don't know. Essentially, there's still much to look forward to!

Fortunately the logic of quantum mechanics is not quite as confusing as Rumsfeld's speech. In Part Two I show that it is possible to describe quantum information in a clear and concise manner to fit our latest description of reality.

在前文中，我们始终从信息的视角来探讨现实世界的各个层面。我们已经发现信息论为我们理解现实世界的诸多方面提供了一个强大的理论框架。Claude Shannon 在创立这个理论时，其实只是想要解决一个非常具体的问题：如何描述 Alice 和 Bob 两方之间的通信过程。他并未考虑过这个理论在通信之外的其他领域会有什么应用价值，但恰恰是这种理论的普适性造就了它的重大意义。那么，这究竟是 Shannon 的偶然幸运，还是说他的研究方法本身就蕴含着某种更为根本的洞见，使得信息论能够获得如此广泛的应用呢？

在本质上，信息论探讨了一个最根本的问题：事件 A 是否与事件 B 存在差异（可区分性，Distinguishability）？这个问题为什么如此根本呢？让我们换个角度思考：假设在一个场景中，你无法区分正确答案和错误答案，那么任何学习或描述都将无从谈起。这种情况下，我们就像失去了感知能力一般。如果世间万物都一模一样，没有可区分性，我们就无法真正理解这个宇宙。

在本书的前半部分，我们已经看到可区分性这一概念在不同领域中的多种应用。例如在生物学中，DNA 通过识别四种不同的碱基来完成自我复制。在热力学中，麦克斯韦妖（Maxwell's Demon）需要区分快速和慢速运动的粒子，才能在容器两侧产生温度差。在赌场中，你面对的至少是两种不同的可能性，而你能否获得收益取决于你对这些概率的理解程度。在社会学研究中，我们关注个人是否持开放自由（liberal）的态度，这直接影响着他们继续居住在原社区的可能性。

区分两种不同状态的这个基本概念，本质上就是 Shannon 所说的比特（bit）信息。比特是信息的最基本计量单位；当有超过两种可能的结果时，我们只需要使用更多的比特来区分它们即可。

显然，如果只有一种事件会发生，讨论两个事件之间的可区分性就毫无意义了。因此，我们还需要知道每个事件发生的概率。正是因为我们能够反复区分不同的结果，我们才能够确定这些结果出现的概率。事件的概率反映了我们对该事件发生的预期，这让我们能够量化事件发生时的意外程度。对于高概率事件，它的发生并不会让我们感到意外（比如太阳升起)；但如果它没有发生，我们反而会感到更加意外。

这些概念都是如此自然和基本，即使你只是坐在椅子上思考，凭借一些经验和直觉，你也会想到与 Shannon 类似的理论框架。从这个角度看，相信你也会认同 Shannon 的信息概念其实非常符合直觉。

那么，这就是全部了吗？有了 Shannon 的信息论，我们就能用信息的视角来解释所有问题了吗？其实并非如此。Shannon 信息论之所以应用广泛，是因为它与我们日常观察到的物理、生物、社会和经济现象共享同样的逻辑基础。但即便如此，它仍然无法完全描述所有现象。Shannon 的信息论本质上是建立在布尔逻辑（Boolean logic）基础之上的，也就是说，对于一个有多种可能结果的事件，每个具体结果不是发生就是不发生 —— 比如当你掷骰子时，要么是 3 点要么不是（你不可能同时掷出 3 点和 6 点）。虽然这个逻辑基础看起来再简单不过了，但有趣的是，我们对宇宙的最新认知却告诉我们，事实并非如此简单。

这种基于事件的布尔逻辑（Boolean logic）也是早期物理模型的典型特征。正如 Shannon 的信息理论建立在确定性结果这一基本理念之上（我们只期望观察到事件 A 或事件 B 的发生，而非两者同时发生），我们的早期物理模型也遵循了同样的思路。早期的物理模型，即我们通常所说的经典物理学（classical physics）或牛顿物理学（Newtonian physics），为人类至今的大多数技术进步奠定了基础，包括电磁学、能量操控、流体动力学和电信技术等领域。这正是我们在学校所学习的物理学，在这个体系中，每个粒子都具有明确的电荷、位置、速度和质量。经典物理学认为，如果我们能够知道宇宙中所有粒子的这些属性，就能够预测任何未来事件的结果，也就是说，宇宙是完全确定性的。为了描述这种完全确定性的概念，科学家们设想了一个神奇的生物，即拉普拉斯妖（Laplace's demon）。这个假想中的生物掌握着宇宙中每一个粒子的所有属性，因此能够准确预知任何事件的发生。对这个生物来说，信息这个概念完全是多余的，因为它已经确切地知道一切将会如何发展。在这样一个毫无悬念的宇宙中，正如 Samuel Johnson 所说：「生命的真谛在于对变化的期待，而非一成不变的确定性。」

值得庆幸的是，即便这个决定论的宇宙对拉普拉斯妖（Laplace's demon）而言是枯燥且可预测的，科学进步，特别是物理学，依然充满着令人惊叹的发现。物理学是一门充满活力的学科：每当我们认为建立了一个能够描述现实的模型时，总会有新的实验结果对我们的认知提出挑战。正是通过这种方式，物理学在时间长河中不断发展，融入更多的信息、新的实验发现和深刻见解，从而越来越准确地描述现实世界。那么问题来了，是什么让经典物理学成为了「经典」？什么样的新理论正在改变这一切？

根据我们目前最新的认知，现实世界的某些特征需要通过一个更高层次的物理学理论 —— 量子理论（quantum theory）来更准确地描述。在量子理论中，决定论的宇宙观不再成立，无论掌握多少信息，所有事件的发生都带有概率性。这意味着拉普拉斯妖从根本上就不可能存在，更不用说在现实中实现了（就像占卜水晶球或古希腊德尔斐神谕都不具备真实预言能力一样）。令人着迷的是，不仅物理学本身充满惊喜，整个宇宙在其本质上也充满着不可预测的惊奇。

那么，我们对物理学的新认识，特别是量子理论（Quantum Theory）的引入，对 Shannon 的信息理论带来了什么影响？Shannon 在创建他的信息理论时并没有考虑到量子世界的特殊性。那么，当我们要描述整个宇宙时，Shannon 信息理论的基础性是否依然有效？答案是肯定的，但需要做出一些调整。在量子理论中，物理状态的可识别性和概率仍然是核心概念，但我们需要拓展对可识别性的理解，以便解释量子世界中的种种反直觉现象。更有趣的是，当我们扩展 Shannon 的信息理论时，我们发现了许多此前完全未被发现的物理现实层面。

在本书的第二部分，我们将介绍并应用一个扩展的信息论 —— 量子信息论（Quantum Information Theory），来展示一些仅依靠 Shannon 信息论（Shannon's Information Theory）无法描述的新特征。在某些情况下，包括本书第一部分所涵盖的内容，量子信息论可以用 Shannon 信息论来近似表示。

而在本书的第二部分，我们将不再拥有这种简化的优势，而是需要完整的量子理论阐述。这让我们得以探索信息处理领域中一些令人着迷的新特性，例如通过量子传送将信息传递到遥远距离的能力，以前所未有的速度进行计算的可能性，以及实现完全无法被破解的安全通信。然而，最令人惊叹的是，这些发现彻底改变了我们对宇宙的认知，并为我们理解宇宙的起源提供了全新的视角。

美国前国务卿 Donald Rumsfeld 在不经意间做出了一个绝妙的比喻，他的说法恰好描述了从香农信息论到量子信息论（quantum information theory）的演变过程：一些我们过去完全不知道存在的事物，现在要么变成了我们知道存在但尚未理解的问题，要么已经被我们完全掌握。当然，这并不意味着所有未知都已被发现 —— 在科学的海洋中，仍然存在着大量我们甚至还没意识到自己不知道的领域。这也正是科学如此令人着迷的地方！

值得庆幸的是，量子力学的逻辑并不像 Rumsfeld 的这番话那样令人困惑。在第二部分中，我将向大家展示如何用清晰而简洁的方式来阐述量子信息，使其符合我们对现实世界的最新认知。

## 0801Quantum Schmuntum: Lights, Camera, Action!

Spring 2005, whilst sitting at my desk in the physics department at Leeds University, marking yet more exam papers, I was interrupted by a phone call. Interruptions were not such a surprise at the time, a few weeks previously I had published an article on quantum theory in the popular science magazine, New Scientist, and had since been inundated with all sorts of calls from the public. Most callers were very enthusiastic, clearly demonstrating a healthy appetite for more information on this fascinating topic, albeit occasionally one or two either hadn't read the article, or perhaps had read into it a little too much. Comments ranging from ‘Can quantum mechanics help prevent my hair loss?' to someone telling me that they had met their twin brother in a parallel Universe, were par for the course, and I was getting a couple of such questions each day. At Oxford we used to have a board for the most creative questions, especially the ones that clearly demonstrated the person had grasped some of the principles very well, but had then taken them to an extreme, and often, unbeknown to them, had violated several other physical laws on the way. Such questions served to remind us of the responsibility we had in communicating science – to make it clear and approachable but yet to be pragmatic. As a colleague of mine often said – sometimes working with a little physics can be more dangerous than working with none at all.

‘Hello Professor Vedral, my name is Jon Spooner, I'm a theatre director and I am putting together a play on quantum theory', said the voice as I picked up the phone. ‘I am weaving elements of quantum theory into the play and we want you as a consultant to verify whether we are interpreting it accurately'. Totally stunned for at least a good couple of seconds, I asked myself, ‘This guy is doing what?' Had I misheard? A play on quantum theory? Anyway it occurred to me that there might be an appetite for something like this, given how successful the production of Copenhagen, a play by Michael Freyn, had been a few years back. Copenhagen was based on an actual meeting that took place in 1941 between two of the early fathers of quantum theory, the Danish Niels Bohr and the German Werner Heisenberg. In Copenhagen (the play) the efforts to clarify or communicate the subtleties of quantum theory were notable but this was not its purpose, so Spooner's play would provide a new spin on things. So I thought, why not? After exchanging a few details we agreed to meet the next morning to discuss it a little more.

One of the attractions of finding out more was that so often science and the arts are viewed as quite antagonistic to one another and it was interesting to find out how someone was trying to bridge that divide. It was also helpful that the building where they were rehearsing was only 200 yards away from my office (and who says theoretical physicists aren't practical!).

The following morning I dropped off my bags at the office and made my way to the theatre to see Jon. The theatre was located in one of the most historic sites on the east side of the university. On the same site is the Trinity St David's congregational church, built by G.F. Danby in 1898, which represents one of the rarest and prettiest examples of gothic architecture in central Leeds. It is a sterling indictment to the enterprise of the university that this church is now home to an impressive student theatre as well as one of the finest nightclubs in Leeds (Loiners will know it as Halo)! Some have commented that this seems to be a part of an ongoing trend, that actors and clubbers appear to be the main groups interested in organized religion these days.

On my first visit, I was a little nervous, not knowing much about theatre and what they expected from me. I was thinking that perhaps I could, in the worst case, just reel off an introductory lecture on quantum theory and brought along some printed diagrams just in case. As I entered the main hall I found several guys huddled in a corner, deep in active discussion. As they looked up, they saw me and I waved back. ‘Ah Professor Vedral, come in and sit down. We have a few questions for you'. It seemed likely that my presence was related to whatever they were discussing, as the mere sight of me caused a decent amount of stirring and a wholehearted diversion of attention. Dispensing with formalities they got straight down to business and asked me about the plausibility of a character in the play who was required to be in two places at the same time. They said that they had heard a little bit about quantum theory and teleportation and they wanted to know if this was possible.

While a couple of the crew seemed to have bought into this idea, several were still sceptical as to whether there was any basis in quantum theory for such a preposterous notion. However, all were understandably quite shocked when I revealed that this was part of my everyday work (though much to their disappointment I had to clarify that I was not experimenting with humans).

I went on to explain that at the heart of quantum physics is the concept of indeterminism. Indeterminism is linked to the fact that an object can indeed be in more than one state at any one time (e.g. you toss a coin and it can give you both heads and tails at the same time). In technical parlance this is known as a quantum superposition. The main difficulty with understanding and teaching quantum mechanics is exactly this counterintuitive and paradoxical nature – people just don't buy it first time around (even Einstein went to his grave certain that this was wrong).

In physics there is a very simple experiment demonstrating superposition and this is what I went on to describe to the theatre crew. Imagine a photon, which is a particle of light, encountering a beam-splitter. A beam-splitter is just a mirror that has a silver coating on it and, by varying the amount of silver, we can tune the probability with which the photon is reflected or transmitted. Let us say that these probabilities are made equal, so that we have the exact equivalent of a fair coin, i.e. half the time the coin will give heads (H) and half the time the coin will give tails (T).

Just as a coin, when tossed, can land heads or tails, so the photon when it hits a beam-splitter can with equal probability either go through or be reflected (i.e. reflection or transmission are equally likely). The experiment contains two sets of beam-splitters, one after the other, where the resultant beam from the first beam-splitter is recombined in the second beam-splitter. Imagine this experiment being analogous to tossing a coin twice. In such a case all four outcomes are equally likely, i.e. we have HH, HT, TH, TT. Interestingly, with the photon we only ever see one result, the other results never occur. So how does this trick work?

Imagine that the photon definitely passes through the first beam-splitter, it then enters the second beam-splitter via a specific path. If it does not pass through the beam-splitter, and is instead reflected, then it enters the second beam-splitter via a different path. On top of this, we don't know which of these scenarios happened, but we know one of them must be true. At the second beam-splitter, whichever path it enters from, the photon similarly passes through the beam-splitter or is reflected. Therefore after the two beam-splitters our photon has four possible scenarios: RR (reflected, reflected), PR (passes through, reflected), RP, or PP. As you can see, this is equivalent to the coin tossing scenarios where after two tosses we have similar results. You know the results of the coin toss are definitely one of the four options, but until you look you just don't know which one. Amazingly though, this is not what is observed when we use a real photon rather than a coin. The real photon always comes out the same way from the second beam-splitter. But surely this is impossible?

If the photon either definitely passed through or was reflected after the first beam-splitter, then we should expect the same after the second, i.e. 50/50 reflection or passing through. Given that this never happens means that we need to re-evaluate what happened at the first beam-splitter. Strangely the only conclusion that we can reach is that it must actually be reflected and pass through at the same time. So what I am really saying is that the photon can actually exist in two spatial locations at the same time. This is the only way two beam-splitters can be combined to give the same outcome, time and time again.

The theatre crew, like the founders of quantum mechanics, were completely baffled by this. But, the fact that a quantum object exists in many different locations at the same time is experimentally beyond any doubt. Since the birth of quantum mechanics there have been numerous different ways of confirming this. I went on to explain further evidence showing how a photon can exist in two different locations at the same time.

Suppose that after the first beam-splitter we slow down the photon if it is reflected, but don't do anything if it passes through. This slowing down can be done by inserting a standard piece of optical equipment called a half-wave plate (itself just a piece of crystal with certain desired properties) in between the first and second beam-splitters. Interestingly, just by slowing down the reflected component after the first beam-splitter, we can alter what happens at the second beam-splitter! If previously, without the half-wave plate, the photon regularly used to come out of the second beam-splitter always reflected, then now, with the half-wave plate inserted, we can make it always pass through. This is the crux of the difference between a quantum object, such as a photon, and something classical, such as a coin. If the photon was random in the same way as a coin, this would be impossible. There is nothing we could do after the first coin toss to make the second coin toss absolutely certain. Coin tosses are completely independent, they happen definitively and in order, and nothing that we do once the first coin toss has happened can possibly change its result. However, with the photon, the first action is indefinite and hence both outcomes are still possible and equally real.

Ultimately this experiment can only be explained if we consider that the photon does not fully reflect or pass through, but actually does both at the same time. This is simply the only explanation that allows for the result that we observe. But what exactly is the mechanism that exploits this indeterminism at the first beam-splitter to give a definitive outcome after the second beam-splitter? This mechanism is known as interference, where one outcome is amplified and the others are cancelled.

‘But water waves can also interfere. Is this quantum interference too?' one of the theatre crew exclaimed. The answer is no. With classical waves, such as water waves, it is always one wave interfering with another, altogether different, wave; in the photon example, however, it is a single photon interfering with itself. This is an altogether different proposition and has no analogue in classical physics.

Note again that we are not describing just one freak experiment with photons: there have been thousands of other experiments confirming this and with different kinds of objects (e.g. electrons, nuclei, atoms, molecules) that confirm that any object can potentially exist in several different places at the same time. In fact these experiments are standard fare for undergraduate quantum courses all over the world. Further to this, we think that the evidence is conclusive enough to suggest that any object in this Universe can be in many different locations at the same time.

At this point, the theatre crew seemed to have had enough, ‘Hold on, Vlatko, this is all well and good, but how come we never see the same person in two places at the same time?' Of course they were correct in asking this; everything is composed of atoms and molecules so surely we should see everything in many places at the same time?

The answer why we don't see this phenomenon lies in another aspect of quantum theory, namely that of measurement. Measurements affect and change the state of the system being measured and through measurements we force the system to adopt one of its many possible states that existed prior to measurement. For example, even if the hero of the play was able to exist in several countries at the same time, as soon as someone asks him ‘which country are you in?', the hero would have to give a single definitive answer. Similarly, while I could exist in several places at the same time, as I am here talking to the actors, the fact that they were listening was a kind of measurement they were performing on me – an interaction that meant that I could not be in any other place at the time.

So our hero leading an instantaneous parallel life in a different country with a different family as a storyline is all well and good, but this is not what quantum theory tells us. Quantum theory tells us that as soon as our hero was to interact with anybody or anything, he would be forced to adopt a unique position. All objects in the Universe are capable of being in all possible states, unless they are forced by measurement to reduce to a subset of those states.

So how can it be that a photon interacting with a beam-splitter or the half-wave plate does not constitute a measurement? This brings us to the heart of the measurement problem in quantum mechanics. Some kinds of interaction seem to destroy the quantumness and give us a definitive answer, whilst others preserve the ability of physical objects to be in many different places at the same time. The rule is that if we need to know the exact value of some property of an object (e.g. spatial location, momentum, energy), then we have to destroy the quantumness to obtain it – otherwise we can leave the quantumness intact.

What is more common than us forcing the quantum object to lose its quantumness, is that it can also lose its quantumness naturally through its interaction with the environment. In fact every object is constantly fighting a battle with the environment. The environment always wants to know more about the quantum object and this is much like a measurement. This is one of the challenges physicists spend a lot of time thinking about and working on. Currently we cannot prevent an atom from strongly interacting with the environment for more than a few seconds (this is currently the most optimistic estimate and only applies to some properties of an atom). The point is that even within this time-frame, we are able to use the quantum indeterminism to do some pretty funky stuff, such as quantum computation and quantum cryptography.

This quantum indeterminism, being in many different states at the same time, is not just confined to the microscopic domain. It is also responsible for all kinds of amazing macroscopic effects that we see around us. It can be used to understand how electrical current can flow without any resistance whatsoever in a superconductor, how neutron stars manage to overcome gravity, how big spiders manage to climb vertical walls, and why you don't fall through your floor given that there is so much empty space between the atoms in your floor. The answers to all of these puzzling questions lie in an understanding of quantum theory.

As I continued my discussion with the theatre crew, I said: ‘This indeterminism stuff is not so hard to grasp, yet it's so important. I don't understand why kids are not taught this in school'. In fact, here in the UK, even if you do physics at high school, quantum mechanics is not taught in any meaningful way. I personally think this is a shame, as the earlier you are exposed to this kind of thinking, the easier it becomes later on in life to accept that this is actually how reality is. Grown-ups are just too sceptical and inflexible and sometimes we find our limited imagination working against us. Since our discussions, I believe Jon is in agreement as he has taken the affirmative action to design another play to communicate quantum theory to junior high school kids. I look forward to these kids eventually turning up in research journals, telling us old timers how we have just missed the point, and that quantum theory is even far more powerful than we thought possible.

At this stage I felt that I was doing all the talking and that they were doing all the listening, so I asked them what their play was about. The beginning of the story introduces one of the main characters telling a story about a spy in the USA. Upon hearing the word ‘spy', I interjected, and thought why not tell them about one of the most striking applications of quantum theory, that of cryptography. They might just be able to weave it into their play.

The science of cryptography, which studies how to make communications more secure and how to break communications, i.e. the art of code-making and code-breaking, has developed markedly with the use of quantum theoretic principles. It is one of the simplest and most effective applications of quantum theory to date.

The need to communicate secretly goes back to the dawn of civilization. The Spartans, who were regarded as the best Ancient Greek warriors, developed a very elaborate cryptographic method, using the scytale, some 400 years before the birth of Christ.

When the whole outcome of the battle could depend on some crucial information communicated between Spartan commanders it was important that the enemy could not get hold of it and use it to their advantage. The scytale was a long stick (the word itself means a baton) around which a strip of cloth was wrapped, following which a message was written on the cloth. The point was that when the cloth was unravelled, the letters of the message appeared to be completely scrambled. One needed the stick itself (or a stick of similar circumference), to decipher the original message; otherwise you could not be sure how the letters line up and what the original message was.

The Spartan method of encryption of messages is generally known as permutation. Permutation is a formal mathematical name for an orderly scrambling of the letters in a sentence to make it incomprehensible. Any type of scrambling will do, as long as it is structured and the receiving party knows how to unscramble it.

Another method of secret communication known to the Ancients is that of substitution. It was first used by Caesar, some 50 years before the birth of Christ. How did Caesar communicate secretly with his army leaders? The idea was very simple. He would write down the alphabet: ABCDEFGHIJK . . ., and then use the shifted sequence: DEFGHIJKLMN . . . instead. So whenever A appears in his sentence, he would replace it by D. Every B would be substituted by E, and so on. The last three letters of the alphabet would then be represented by ABC. The order ‘ATTACK TOMORROW' would then be encoded as ‘DWWDFN WRPRUURZ'. And it is clear that just looking at the raw encrypted message doesn't make a lot of sense to anyone.

So in each case unless we knew exactly how the alphabet was shifted or knew the circumference of the stick used to encode the message we wouldn't be able to decode the communication. Since ancient times substitution and permutation ciphers have evolved considerably from parchments and cloth and there are now some very complex computational encryption models based on these tricks which are practically unbreakable (that is, unless you have 1000-odd parallel computers or about 150 years handy). What is surprising is that though substitution and permutation are still two of the most popular tricks to encode secretly, they are inherently breakable. It is comforting to know that to break current models would take around 1000 parallel computers or 150 years of processing time. However, given that computational power is growing all the time, how long can these approaches really remain secure?

In fact, of the tens of thousands of cryptographic protocols known to us, the only unbreakable one, as proven by Shannon, is the ‘one-time pad'. The one-time pad is a cryptographic algorithm that cannot be broken simply through extending our computational power ad infinitum. It has a much stronger basis and, if done correctly, no amount of computing power currently or in the future is going to help. In theory it is very simple and only requires four rules to be obeyed to obtain perfect security:

1 The two parties that wish to communicate securely must already share a secret key. This key is used to convert your message into an ‘encoded' form and then de-convert it back to the original form. It can only be known to both parties in communication (but cannot be known to anyone else). Once the secret key is established then the two parties can choose to communicate securely using that key at any time in the future.

2 The key you use to encode your message must be completely random. If there is a way of predicting if the next digit is zero or one, the code can no longer be used as this leaves the protocol open to a structured attack.

3 The key must be as long as the message itself, i.e. the number of bits that make up the key is the same as the number of bits that make up the message. If it is shorter then the protocol will be left susceptible to attack.

4 The key must be used only once (again, repetitions leave the code open to attack).

This is all very well, and if we could do all of these we would have perfectly secure communication and many of the cryptographers around the world would be out of a job. But in reality the art and development of cryptography is alive and well because the one-time pad is so darned difficult to use. Running through the requirements, requirement 3 and 4 seem simple enough, requirement 2 raises some eyebrows – I mean what is a completely random key?, and requirement 1 just seems plain ridiculous. What's the point of two parties already needing to share a secret key in order to communicate a secret message? Surely whatever method was used to securely share the secret key can also be used to share the secret message. This just turns out to be a bit of a ‘Catch 22' – you need the secret key to communicate secretly, but you also need to communicate secretly to establish the secret key in the first place! The problem of perfectly secure communication (assuming we can satisfy requirement 2) then reduces to the problem of being able to share a secret key in the first place. This problem is known as the key distribution problem and is one of the main challenges in cryptography, to which standard computer science and engineering have no final answer.

This is where quantum theory comes in – not only does it help us with requirement 1, and hence the key distribution problem, it also helps us with requirement 2 – that the key should be completely randomly generated. The latter we will elaborate on in Chapter 10.

Quantum theory gives us a novel solution to the key distribution problem. By making use of the fact that any measurement to determine a state irrevocably changes the state we can tell when the state has been tampered with. This is what we discussed earlier, where each bit of a key could exist in several different states at any one time. Then, if an eavesdropper covertly tries to capture any information from the key, this interference acts like a measurement and hence forces the bit to adopt one state or the other. The sender and receiver can then analyse a subset of the key in order to determine whether there is any eavesdropping present. If not, then they use the key; otherwise they discard everything and start the process again. Of course, the eavesdropping detected may not have been due to the presence of a human agent, but may have been due to some kind of noise on the line. However, to be safe, we must assume the worst case.

This approach was discovered in the early 1980s by an American, Charles Bennett, and a Canadian, Giles Brassard, and has been implemented successfully on a wide variety of fronts. An alter native method proposed independently by Artur Ekert, an Oxford physicist, is also very popular. Currently the bit rate is not very high, but if you want to send a single message super-securely, then this could work for you. For example, in October 2007, a quantum cryptography system was tested by Nicolas Gisin during the Swiss National Elections in Geneva. The Geneva canton (jurisdiction) used a dedicated line for counting the ballots and communicating this information securely between the counting office and the central polling station. The message was short, so it required very few bits, but it was of the utmost importance, and the Swiss did not want to risk any tampering. This was a genuine application of quantum theory to facilitate a problem for which we have no solution classically.

This is all well and good, but now where does this leave us? The key question is whether and how, with the introduction of quantum theory, the concept of information is affected. Now, instead of having a definite outcome as we saw in the earlier chapters, quantum mechanics tells us that we can have several possible outcomes. In the previous chapter, when we talked about social ordering, information was seen as a binding force between different social units. Similarly, information here is also a binding force between different aspects of a quantum system.

One would think we were fairly safe in assuming that mutual information cannot ever exceed 100% (i.e. it cannot be better than perfect). If all children who go to good schools perform magnificently in life, we would say that there is 100% mutual information between good schools and successful life (whatever your definition of a successful life might be). You surely cannot share more than 100% of information. However, odd as it may sound, quantum systems can actually share more mutual information than 100%. Any theory of information needs to be able to handle this in order to fully describe reality; otherwise there will be parts of reality inaccessible to our understanding.





To explain how information can exceed 100%, imagine a simple two-state quantum system, such as the ‘spin' of an electron. Using the metaphor of spinning tops, we can consider that electrons are like small spinning tops, each ‘spinning' in its own way, depending on the external circumstances. An electron, just like the spinning top, can be considered to spin clockwise or counterclockwise in any given direction: horizontally, vertically, at 45 degrees, and so on. Astonishingly, if we measure the electron spin at two different times, then the mutual information between these measurements can actually exceed any value that we could had previously thought possible. In classical physics, spins at different times can be correlated in the horizontal or vertical direction, so that, if the first measurement of spin yields ‘horizontal clockwise', so does the second measurement, in which case, the mutual information between them is 100%. Real electrons, on the other hand, behave quantum mechanically and their spin measurements could be correlated in the vertical direction at the same time as the horizontal direction (and all other directions!). This is because electrons can spin simultaneously in the clockwise and counterclockwise directions, something that no spinning top can do. In this case we can say that they may share up to 200% information. This super-correlation is known as quantum entanglement, or ‘spooky action at a distance' as Einstein referred to it.

There is a particularly fruitful way of viewing mutual information between objects that is responsible for the common sense phrase ‘The whole is at least as large as any of its parts'. Suppose you have two friends, Steve and Bryan, and each of them has a choice of what to do next. Steve could either continue with his current employment or quit and find another job. Bryan faces the same choices. If they are completely uncertain about their future, we would attribute one bit of information to each of them, since they each have a choice of two possibilities. Now it is clear that the information residing in the joint future of Steve and Bryan is at least as big as each of the individual pieces of information. This is easy to see by imagining that we found out that Steve left his job. So there is no more uncertainty about his future. However, we still don't know what Bryan will do. The uncertainty is now as large as one bit, and it all lies in Bryan's choice. This is precisely the same as the ‘I'll have a drink, if you have a drink' example we gave earlier. It is interesting that though the causal link in the two scenarios is different, it still leads to the same mutual information. Moreover, mutual information does not depend on causality at all; it is quite reasonable that two parties that have no causal link whatsoever can still share 100% correlation.

We can now phrase this all in terms of entropy, the measure we saw earlier to reflect the degree of uncertainty in a system. The entropy of the whole system must (classically speaking) be at least as large as the entropy of any of its parts. In this sense it is useful to think of entropy in terms of an area. The area of the USA is at least as big as any of its states. Even if some states overlap and contain common regions this surely must always be the case. So if you are looking for someone in the USA, your uncertainty concerning their whereabouts must be at least as big as your uncertainty if you know they are somewhere in California. The uncertainty of their position in California cannot be larger than the uncertainty of their position in the whole of the USA, given that there are many additional places in the rest of the USA to hide.

Astonishingly, in quantum mechanics this sentence no longer holds. In the quantum version of this task it may be more difficult to find the person if you focus specifically on California than if you search the whole of the USA. Somehow, in the quantum version, the area of California turns out to be larger than the overall area of the USA!

So what is our evidence that quantum systems behave in such a manner? Well, now I guess you are asking if this is for real. It seems very counterintuitive. This is true and moreover we can do an experiment with, say, two spinning electrons, to test it. They are created in such a way that there is absolutely no uncertainty about their overall state, but, if we look at each of them individually, it looks like a complete mess. In other words, they need each other to fully describe their state. This does not happen classically; if one of the systems is in a mess then adding another system cannot decrease the amount of mess. Ultimately this goes back to the fact that the two electrons are really super-correlated in quantum physics, some might say like ‘identical twins' – i.e. there is some additional mutual information ‘beyond the norm'.

So if this is how reality really works, can we still describe it in terms of information? The answer is affirmative, but clearly the Shannon entropy is not enough. The problem with Shannon's information is that it always tells us that there is at least as much information in a whole as there is in any of its parts. But, as we discussed, this is not true for quantum systems. Information therefore requires a more generalized treatment than that proposed by Shannon.

The key change is to upgrade the (classical) notion of a bit to something called a quantum bit or ‘qubit'. A qubit is a quantum system that, unlike a bit, can exist in any combination of the two states, zero and one. All other ingredients of Shannon's theory remain intact. To quantify information, instead of using the entropy of a bit, we take the entropy of a qubit. This was first done by another student of John Wheeler, Ben Schumacher, who also coined the term qubit. The change from bit to qubit, although it may appear trivial, actually has profound implications. Going back to the example of the whole being less than some of its parts, the quantum entropy of two correlated quantum systems can now indeed be smaller than the entropy of each of them individually.

The theory of quantum information is a superset of Shannon information in that it reduces to Shannon information in certain cases. The key thing that quantum information tells us about reality, beyond what we have already learnt through Shannon, is that there is a great deal of untapped potential in terms of what we can achieve in information processing. Quantum information theory is already being exploited to design a new order of super-fast computers, highly secure cryptographic systems and, believe it or not, to teleport objects across vast distances.

The reader may be worried that the upgrade to quantum information now suddenly invalidates all the conclusions from Part One of the book. Quite the opposite in fact is the case. We could have approached DNA from the perspective of quantum information but, as it is a macroscopic phenomenon, the results of using the classical theory of information appear to capture fully the most important function of DNA. The same can be said for any of the information processing systems in the first part of the book. All such systems could be re-derived from the perspective of quantum information theory, but as they are macroscopic systems, the approximation given by classical information theory is sufficient. This is not to say that quantum physics does not apply to macroscopic objects – on the contrary, it applies to all matter in the Universe. It's just that its predictions are much less distinct from conventional physics at this level – so naturally we tend not to bother with the additional complexity of using quantum physics when we feel we don't need to.

From the point of view of information we can summarize two of the most important features of quantum theory; first, that qubits can exist in a variety of different states at the same time; and, secondly, when we measure a qubit we reduce it to a classical result, i.e. we get a definitive outcome.

Both of the above features could be either positive or negative characteristics, depending on the application. Regarding the notion that qubits can exist in a variety of different states at the same time, a positive is that the qubit has a far more intricate structure than a classical bit. This gives more power and flexibility to quantum information processing than was possible with our classical theory of information. Conversely, in some cases, as in cryptography, if the receiver doesn't have precise details then he is unable to decipher the message without damaging the state. Likewise with the measurement. On the positive side, we have explained that in quantum cryptography, it allows us to detect eavesdroppers; however, on the negative side, it reduces a qubit to a bit, and therefore reduces our information processing ability.

The pros and cons of quantum information are best seen in the next chapter as we discuss quantum computing.

量子闹腾：聚光灯下的科学秀！

2005 年春天，当我坐在利兹大学物理系的办公桌前批改试卷时，接到了一个电话。此时的电话中断并不罕见，因为几周前我在流行科学杂志《新科学家》上发表了一篇关于量子理论的文章，此后便不断接到公众的各种电话。大多数来电者都热情非凡，显露出对这个深奥主题的强烈求知欲，尽管偶尔也会遇到一些未仔细阅读文章或过度解读的人。从「量子力学能帮助我防止脱发吗？」到有人声称在想象中的平行宇宙（parallel Universe）遇到了自己的双胞胎兄弟，这些怪异的提问已是家常便饭。在牛津大学，我们曾经设立了一个展示最富创意问题的板报，特别是那些显示提问者虽然理解了部分科学原理，但随后将其推向极端，无意中触犯了其他物理定律的问题。这些问题 constantly 提醒我们在传播科学时肩负的使命：既要使科学知识清晰易懂，又要保持理性和严谨。正如我的一位同事常说，有时候略知皮毛的科学知识，反而比完全不懂更容易误入歧途。

"你好 Vedral 教授，我是 Jon Spooner，一名剧场导演，正在创作一部关于量子理论的舞台剧」，电话那头的声音说道。"我正在戏剧中融入量子理论的元素，希望您能作为顾问，帮我们验证理论诠释的准确性。"

我被这番话惊得愣了好几秒，心里暗想：这人在干什么？我是不是听错了？量子理论的舞台剧？

转念一想，或许这个题材会引起观众的兴趣。毕竟几年前，迈克尔·弗莱恩的戏剧《哥本哈根》曾获得巨大成功。这部戏剧改编自 1941 年量子理论早期两位奠基人 —— 丹麦科学家尼尔斯·波尔和德国科学家维尔纳·海森堡的真实会面。

虽然《哥本哈根》在阐释量子理论的微妙之处颇为出色，但那并非剧作的主要目的。而 Spooner 的作品，看起来将为这一主题带来全新的阐释视角。

既然如此，何不一试？我们简单交换了几句，约定第二天早上详细讨论这个项目。

探索科学与艺术交叉领域的一个迷人之处，在于这两个看似水火不相容的领域竟可能找到共同点。当我得知有人正致力于弥合这一鸿沟时，内心颇为兴奋。更令人高兴的是，排练地点就在我办公室附近仅约 180 米处（没错，理论物理学家也可以很实际！）。

第二天早晨，我在办公室放下行李，径直走向剧院，去会见 Jon。这个剧院坐落在大学东侧最具历史魅力的地点之一。同一区域内还矗立着 Trinity St David's 会众教堂，这座 1898 年由 G.F. Danby 设计的建筑，堪称利兹市中心哥特式建筑的稀世珍品。大学富有创意地将这座古老的教堂转变为充满活力的学生剧院和城市最负盛名的夜店之一（当地人亲切地称之为 Halo）。有人调侃，这或许反映了一种有趣的社会趋势：如今，演员和夜店常客似乎成为对传统宗教最感兴趣的群体。

在我第一次拜访剧组时，内心颇为忐忑。我对戏剧世界还不太熟悉，不确定他们会对我有什么期望。为了以防万一，我甚至准备了量子理论的入门讲稿，还带了几张备用的图表。走进主厅时，我看到几位剧组成员挤在角落，正热烈地讨论着什么。他们抬头看到我，我也友好地回应了他们的目光。"啊，Vedral 教授，请进来坐下。我们有几个问题想请教您。"

显然，我的到来与他们正在讨论的话题有关。我一出现，现场立即变得活跃起来，所有人的注意力都集中在了我身上。他们也没有拐弯抹角，径直问起了一个有趣的剧情设计：剧中是否可能让一个角色同时出现在两个地方？他们对量子理论和量子传送略有所闻，想听听专业人士的看法。

船员中虽然有几人对这个想法表示认同，但大多数人仍对这种看似荒谬的概念持怀疑态度，质疑其是否有量子理论的支撑。当我透露这正是我日常工作的一部分时（尽管令他们失望，我不得不澄清并非对人类进行实验），所有人都不禁感到震惊。

我接着解释了量子物理学的核心：不确定性原理。这个原理揭示了一个令人惊讶的事实 - 物体可以同时存在于多个状态（就像掷硬币时，硬币既可能是正面朝上，也可能是反面朝上）。在专业术语中，这种现象被称为「量子叠加态」。理解和教授量子力学最大的挑战，恰恰在于这种违背常理、看似矛盾的本质 - 人们往往难以一次性接受这种反直觉的概念（甚至连爱因斯坦临终前也坚信这是错误的）。

在物理学中，有一个非常简单的实验可以展示量子世界的神奇特性 —— 叠加态（物体同时存在于多种状态的现象）。我接下来将向剧组讲解这个有趣的实验。

想象一个光子（光的基本粒子）遇到一个特殊的光学器件 —— 分束器（一种可以分割光束的半透明镜子）。这种分束器通过调整银的镀层厚度，可以精确控制光子被反射或透射的概率。就像抛一枚公平的硬币一样，光子有 50% 的几率走一条路径，50% 的几率走另一条路径，完全取决于概率。

就像硬币抛掷时可能正面朝上或反面朝上一样，光子（photon）在传播经过分光器（beam-splitter）时，有相等的概率通过或被反射（即反射和透射的概率各为 50%）。这个实验包含两组连续的分光器，第一个分光器产生的光束在第二个分光器中重新组合。可以将这个实验类比为两次掷硬币。在掷硬币的情况下，所有四种结果都同样可能，即正正（HH)、正反（HT)、反正（TH)、反反（TT）。然而，有趣的是，在光子实验中，我们只观察到一种结果，而其他可能的结果从未出现。那么，这种现象背后的物理机制究竟是什么？

在量子实验中，让我们想象一个光子经过一系列分光器。当光子通过第一个分光器时，它可能沿两种不同的路径前进：直接通过或被反射。尽管我们无法预知具体的路径，但我们确定光子必定选择了其中一种路径。当光子到达第二个分光器时，同样面临通过或反射的选择。

按照经典物理学的预期，光子应该呈现四种可能的结果组合：完全反射（RR）、部分通过和部分反射（PR 或 RP）、完全通过（PP）。这种情况类似于掷硬币：两次掷硬币后，结果必定是四种可能中的一种，但在揭晓之前，结果是未知的。

然而，量子世界的奇特之处在于，当实际进行实验时，光子的行为完全不同。令人惊讶的是，光子总是以相同的方式穿过第二个分光器，这似乎违背了所有经典物理学的逻辑。这种现象挑战了我们对现实的基本认知，揭示了量子世界的根本不确定性。

如果光子在第一个分光器（beam-splitter）后要么确定通过，要么被反射，那么我们应该在第二个分光器上也期望同样的情况，即各有 50% 概率的反射或通过。然而，现实结果却始终不符合这种预期，这意味着我们必须重新审视第一个分光器上发生的情况。令人惊讶的是，唯一合理的解释是：光子必须同时处于反射和通过两种状态。换句话说，光子实际上可以同时存在于两个不同的空间位置。这是两个分光器能够一次又一次产生相同实验结果的唯一解释。

剧组成员，就像量子力学的创始人们一样，对这一现象感到完全困惑。但是，量子对象（quantum object）可以同时存在于多个位置这一事实，已通过实验无可争议地得到证实。自量子力学（quantum mechanics）诞生以来，科学家们已经用多种不同方法验证了这一奇特现象。我接着详细阐述了关于光子如何同时存在于两个空间位置的实验证据。

想象一下，在光线第一次被分开的地方，我们给被反射的光子「减速」，而对穿过的光子不做任何处理。这个「减速」可以通过在分光镜之间放置一种特殊的光学器件 —— 半波片（一种具有特定光学特性的晶体）来实现。

有趣的是，仅仅改变被反射光子的行进速度，我们就能影响它在第二个分光镜上的表现！举个例子，如果原本光子在第二个分光镜总是被反射，现在通过插入半波片，我们可以让它总是笔直地穿过。

这正是量子世界（如光子）与经典世界（如硬币）的根本区别。如果光子像掷硬币一样遵循传统的随机性，这种「变魔术」般的操作就是不可能的。打个比方，在第一次掷硬币后，你无论如何都无法预测或控制第二次掷硬币的结果。传统的硬币掷出是独立且确定的事件，之前的操作不会影响后续结果。

而在量子世界里，事情变得更加奇妙。光子的初始状态是不确定的，这意味着多种可能性同时存在，就像一个处于开启和关闭状态的开关。这种「量子叠加」的特性，使得我们可以通过精巧的操作，改变看似已经确定的结果。

在这个实验中，光子呈现出一种令人惊讶的量子行为：它似乎能够同时「反射」和「穿过」分束器。这种看似违反直觉的现象，是量子世界中独特的特征。那么，是什么神奇的机制让这个单一的光子在第一个分束器的模糊状态下，最终在第二个分束器后呈现出确定的结果呢？

这就是量子干涉（Quantum Interference）的奇妙之处。在这个过程中，光子的所有可能路径会相互作用，最终只有一个路径被「放大」，而其他路径则被抵消。

"水波不也会发生干涉吗？这是量子干涉吗？」剧组中有人好奇地问道。这个问题很有趣！传统的水波干涉是不同波之间的相互作用，而量子干涉则更加神奇：单个光子竟然可以与自身「干涉」。这种现象在经典物理学中是完全无法想象的，它揭示了量子世界的奇特本质。

需要强调的是，我们并非仅仅描述一个关于光子的罕见实验。事实上，已有数千项实验证实了这一量子现象，这些实验涉及电子、原子核、原子、分子等各种微观物体，证明了任何物体理论上都可以同时存在于多个不同位置。这些实验已经成为全球大学量子物理课程的标准内容。更为重要的是，我们有充分的证据表明，宇宙中的任何物体都可能同时存在于多个不同的位置。

这时，现场的人们忍不住打断了讲述，"且慢，Vlatko，这些听起来很有趣，但为什么我们从未看到同一个人同时出现在两个地方？」他们的疑问确实很有道理。既然一切物体都由原子和分子组成，为什么我们看不到它们同时出现在多个位置呢？

量子世界中之所以没有出现物体同时存在于多个地方的现象，关键在于量子理论中的一个重要特性：测量。测量并不是简单的观察，而是会主动干预和改变被观测对象的状态。通过测量，我们会迫使量子系统从原本可能存在的多种状态中「选择」一种确定的状态。

打个比喻，就像剧中的主角理论上可以同时存在于多个国家，但只要有人问他「你在哪个国家？」，他就必须给出一个明确的地点。同样的道理，当我与演员交谈时，他们的听闻本身就构成了一种测量行为 - 这种互动让我在那一刻只能存在于当前位置，而无法同时出现在其他地方。

假设我们的主角在另一个国家同时拥有一个不同的家庭，这听起来是个有趣的情节，但这并不是量子理论所描述的现实。量子理论告诉我们，一旦主角与任何人或事物发生相互作用，他就必须选择一个确定的状态。宇宙中的所有物体在没有被测量之前，原则上可以同时存在于多种可能的状态，只有在测量时才会被迫「坍缩」到某个特定状态。

这就引出了一个有趣的问题：为什么光子与光学分束器（将光束分成两部分的光学器件）或半波片（改变光波振动方向的器件）的相互作用不被视为测量？这正是量子力学中测量问题的核心。某些相互作用似乎会破坏对象的量子性（即模糊、叠加的特性），给出一个明确的结果；而另一些相互作用则保持了物理对象同时存在于多个位置的量子特性。关键在于，如果我们需要精确知道一个对象的某些属性（如空间位置、动量或能量），就必然要「破坏」其量子特性 - 反之，我们可以保持其量子特性不变。

与我们主动使量子系统丧失量子特性不同，量子系统更常见的「退化」是通过与周围环境的自然相互作用。实际上，每个量子系统都在不断地与环境「博弈」。环境总是试图获取量子系统的更多信息，这种行为本质上类似于一次测量。这也是物理学家持续深入研究的重大挑战之一。目前，科学家尚未找到可以阻止原子与环境强烈相互作用超过几秒钟的方法（这是当前最乐观的估计，仅适用于原子的部分特性）。尽管如此，即便在这短暂的时间里，科学家们已经能够利用量子不确定性实现一些开创性的技术，如量子计算和量子密码学。

量子不确定性并不仅限于微观世界，它还能解释我们身边许多令人惊奇的宏观现象。这种神奇的量子特性帮助我们理解了一系列看似不可能的现象：为什么超导体可以让电流无阻流动，中子星能够对抗引力，大蜘蛛能攀爬光滑的垂直墙面，以及为什么我们站在地板上不会坠落 —— 尽管地板由大量彼此之间存在巨大空隙的原子组成。这些看似矛盾的谜题，都可以通过深入理解量子理论得到解释。

在与剧组继续交谈时，我侃侃而谈："量子世界的不确定性其实并不难理解，偏偏又如此重要。可惜的是，学校为什么不教孩子们这些？」事实上，在英国，即便是选修物理课程，学生也很少真正接触量子力学。我认为这是非常可惜的。越早接触这种思维方式，将来就越容易理解这个世界的真实运转方式。成年人常常思维僵化、疑虑重重，有时候我们狭隘的想象力反而会成为理解的障碍。

我们的讨论之后，Jon 似乎也深受启发，他决定创作一部新剧，旨在向初中生生动地讲解量子理论。我满怀期待：也许未来的某一天，这些孩子会在科研论文中告诉我们这些「老古董」，量子理论远比我们想象的更加神奇和深奥。

在这个时刻，我感觉自己一直在侃侃而谈，而他们则专注地聆听。于是，我主动询问他们的剧本主题。故事开篇介绍了一个主要角色讲述美国间谍的故事。一听到「间谍」这个词，我立即来了兴趣，心想何不与他们分享量子理论最令人惊叹的应用之一 —— 密码学？说不定他们可以将这个引人入胜的科学话题融入剧本中。

密码学是一门研究如何保护通信安全、如何破解通信的科学，本质上是关于编码与解码的艺术。随着量子理论原理的应用，密码学已经取得了显著进展。事实上，这是迄今为止量子理论最简单且最有效的应用之一。

秘密通信的需求可以追溯到人类文明的最初阶段。斯巴达人 —— 古希腊最著名的战士，在耶稣诞生前约 400 年就发明了一种极其复杂的加密方法。他们使用的「斯塔莱」（scytale）是一种将信息编码的特殊工具，可以说是早期密码技术的代表。

在斯巴达战争中，指挥官之间传递的一条关键信息可能会决定战斗的胜负，因此必须防止敌人获取并利用这些信息。斯巴达人发明了一种独特的加密方法，称为 Scytale（意为「棒"）：首先将一条细长的布条缠绕在一根特定直径的圆棍上，然后在布条上写下秘密信息。当布条展开后，信息看起来就像是一串毫无意义的随机字母。

要想还原原始信息，接收者必须使用与发送者完全相同尺寸的圆棍重新将布条缠绕。只有这样，字母才能恢复正确的排列顺序，还原出原始的秘密内容。这种方法就像是一把只有发送者和接收者才知道的特殊「解密钥匙」。

这种加密方法在数学上被称为「置换密码」，简单来说，就是按照特定规则对文字进行有序重新排列，使其变得难以理解。只要重排方法是有逻辑的，并且接收者知道如何还原，任何重排方式都可以作为加密手段。

古代密码学中，替换密码（Substitution Cipher）是一种重要的秘密通信方法。这种加密技术最早可追溯到公元前 50 年左右的凯撒时期。凯撒是如何与军队领导者进行秘密通信的呢？其方法极其巧妙且简单：首先写下完整字母表 ABCDEFGHIJK……，然后将每个字母按固定偏移量替换，例如向后平移 3 位，即 DEFGHIJKLMN……。这意味着原文中的 A 会被 D 替换，B 会被 E 替换，以此类推。字母表末尾的字母则循环到开头。举例来说，"ATTACK TOMORROW」这条命令会被加密为「DWWDFN WRPRUURZ」。这种加密方式使得未经解密的信息看起来完全是无意义的随机字母序列。

在古代密码学中，如果不知道字母移位的 precise 规则或用于编码消息的工具（如特定尺寸的棍子），我们就无法破解通信内容。随着时间推移，替换密码（Substitution Cipher）和置换密码（Permutation Cipher）已从早期的羊皮纸和布帛技术，演变出极其复杂的计算加密模型，这些模型近乎不可破解 — 除非你拥有 1000 台并行计算机或能等待约 150 年。

有趣的是，尽管这两种密码技术仍是秘密通信的主流方法，但它们本质上都存在破译可能性。虽然目前破解这些加密模型需要令人望而生畏的计算资源，但随着计算技术的指数级增长，我们不禁要问：这些传统加密方法还能坚持多久？

事实上，在我们所知的数万种加密协议中，唯一经 Shannon 证明为不可破解的是「一次性密码本"(One-time Pad）。这是一种加密算法，即使通过无限增加计算能力也无法破解。它具有更坚实的理论基础，只要正确实施，无论是当前还是未来的任何计算能力都无法攻破。从理论上讲，它极其简单，只需遵守四个规则就能实现完美安全：

1 通信的双方必须预先共享一个秘密密钥。这个密钥用于将消息转换为加密形式，并能将其还原为原始信息。这个密钥只能为通信双方所知（对其他任何人都是保密的）。一旦建立了秘密密钥，双方就可以在未来的任何时刻选择使用该密钥进行安全通信。

2 用于编码消息的密钥必须完全随机。如果存在可以预测下一个数字是零还是一的方法，这种加密方案就会失效，因为这会使协议面临结构化攻击的风险。

3 密钥长度必须与消息长度完全一致，即密钥的比特数与消息的比特数相同。如果密钥长度不足，整个加密协议将极易遭到攻击。

4 密钥必须仅使用一次，因为重复使用会严重削弱密码系统的安全性。

这一切看似完美，如果我们能做到这些，就会拥有完全安全的通信，而世界各地的密码学家可能就要失业了。但现实是，密码学的艺术和发展仍然生机勃勃，这是因为一次性密码本（one-time pad）实在太难使用了。

仔细审视这些要求，需求 3 和需求 4 看起来相当直接，需求 2 则引发了一些疑问 - 究竟什么是真正随机的密钥？而需求 1 更是显得有些不合常理。试想，为什么通信双方需要预先共享一个秘密密钥才能传递秘密消息？似乎用于安全共享秘密密钥的方法本身就可以用来直接传递秘密消息。这正是一个典型的「循环论证」困境 - 你需要秘密密钥来进行秘密通信，但同时又需要秘密通信来最初建立这个密钥！

假设我们能解决随机性的问题，那么完全安全通信的挑战就归结为最初如何安全地共享密钥。这个被称为密钥分发问题的难题，是现代密码学中最基本的挑战之一，即便是计算机科学和工程领域，至今仍未找到完美的解决方案。

量子理论在这里发挥了关键作用 —— 它不仅帮助我们解决第一个需求，进而解决密钥分发问题，还能确保第二个需求得以实现，即确保密钥的完全随机生成。关于第二个需求的具体机制，我们将在第 10 章做更详细的讨论。

量子理论为信息安全中的密钥交换问题提供了一种革命性的解决方案。这个方案基于一个有趣的量子物理原理：在量子世界中，观测本身会改变被观测对象的状态。

想象密钥就像一组处于不确定状态的量子「硬币」。这些「硬币」可以同时存在多种状态，就像既是正面又是反面。当有人试图偷偷窥探这些「硬币」时，观测行为本身会立即固定它们的状态，就像强制它们选择要么是正面要么是反面。

发送方和接收方可以通过检查一小部分「硬币」来判断通信过程中是否存在未经授权的窃听。如果发现有人试图获取信息，整组密钥将被立即作废，并重新开始传输。这种方法不仅能检测主动窃听，还能应对线路噪声等意外干扰。

为了确保最高级别的安全，通信双方总是假设存在恶意窃听，并据此采取严格的安全措施。

这种量子密码学方法是由美国学者 Charles Bennett 和加拿大研究员 Giles Brassard 在 1980 年代初期率先提出，并已在多个领域成功应用。牛津物理学家 Artur Ekert 独立发展的另一种量子加密方法同样广受关注。尽管目前传输速率还相对有限，但对于需要绝对安全通信的场景，这项技术颇具潜力。

2007 年 10 月，一个生动的应用案例发生在瑞士日内瓦国家选举中。Nicolas Gisin 实施了量子密码系统，用于选举计票过程中的安全通信。日内瓦州使用专用通信线路，在计票办公室和中央投票站之间传递选举数据。虽然传输的信息很短，只需极少量数据，但其安全性至关重要 - 瑞士方面不愿意冒任何被篡改的风险。

这一案例生动地展示了量子理论在解决传统密码学无法应对的安全挑战中的独特价值，标志着信息安全技术的一次重大突破。

量子理论的引入为我们带来了一个根本性的问题：信息的本质究竟会发生何种变化？与传统物理学中的确定性结果不同，量子力学揭示了一个充满可能性的世界。在前一章讨论社会秩序时，我们将信息视为连接不同社会单元的纽带；而在量子世界中，信息同样扮演着类似的角色，成为连接量子系统各个方面的桥梁。这种信息的多样性和不确定性，正是量子力学最迷人的特征之一。

人们常常认为互信息（描述两个随机变量之间关联程度的统计指标）不可能超过 100%，就像不可能有比「完美」更好的结果一样。打个比方，如果所有就读优质学校的孩子都在未来人生中获得成功，我们就会说学校教育与人生成就之间存在 100% 的关联。直觉上，信息共享似乎不可能超过 100%。

然而，在量子世界中，这个常识会被颠覆。量子系统竟然能够以超出我们想象的方式共享信息，突破传统信息论的 100% 限制。这意味着我们现有的信息理论可能存在盲点，无法完全解释量子世界的奇特现象。如果不能理解这一点，我们的理论就会像一幅未完成的拼图，永远无法全面地描绘宇宙的真实面貌。

为了解释信息如何超过 100%，让我们来探索量子世界中一个有趣的现象：电子的自旋（spin）。想象电子就像一个微小的陀螺，它可以在不同方向上旋转。在传统的物理认知中，一个陀螺只能朝一个方向旋转 —— 要么顺时针，要么逆时针。但量子世界的电子却完全不同。

在量子力学中，电子的自旋可以同时存在于多个状态。就像一个神奇的陀螺，它既能顺时针旋转，又能逆时针旋转。这听起来似乎违反常理，但在量子世界里，这却是真实存在的。

当我们在不同时间测量电子的自旋时，会发生一些令人惊讶的事情。传统物理学中，如果第一次测量显示电子在某个方向上自旋，第二次测量通常会得到相同的结果，互信息（mutual information）会被限制在 100% 以内。然而，量子世界打破了这个限制。

量子纠缠（quantum entanglement）这一奇特现象，让电子的自旋可以在多个方向上同时关联，使得它们之间的信息关联超过了 100%。这就像两个遥远的电子能够「心灵感应」，instantaneously 知道对方的状态，即使它们相隔很远。

爱因斯坦曾称这种现象为「遥远的诡异作用」，因为它挑战了我们对物理世界的传统理解。这个看似不可能的 200% 信息，实际上揭示了量子世界的奇妙本质：信息和关联可以超出我们想象的边界。

---

为了解释信息如何能够超过 100%，让我们想象一个简单的双态量子系统，比如电子的「自旋」（spin）。我们可以用陀螺来打个比方：电子就像小陀螺，会根据周围环境以不同方式「旋转」。就像陀螺可以在任何方向上顺时针或逆时针旋转一样，电子也可以在水平方向、垂直方向、45 度角等任何方向上「自旋」。

令人惊讶的是，当我们在不同时间点测量电子自旋时，这些测量之间的互信息（mutual information）可以超出我们之前认为可能的任何数值。在经典物理学中，不同时间的自旋只能在水平或垂直方向上相关联。例如，如果第一次测量显示「水平顺时针」，那么第二次测量也会显示相同结果，这种情况下它们之间的互信息是 100%。

然而，真实的电子遵循量子力学规律，它们的自旋测量可以同时在多个方向上相关联 —— 不仅是水平方向，还包括垂直方向和所有其他方向！这是因为电子能够同时进行顺时针和逆时针自旋，这是普通陀螺绝对做不到的。在这种情况下，我们可以说它们之间共享的信息可以达到 200%。这种超级相关性被称为量子纠缠（quantum entanglement），爱因斯坦称之为「超距作用」（spooky action at a distance）。

有一种理解物体之间互信息的特别有效方式，它解释了「整体至少与其任何部分一样大」这句常识性的说法。假设你有两个朋友 Steve 和 Bryan，他们每个人都需要决定下一步怎么做。Steve 可以选择继续现在的工作，或者辞职找新工作。Bryan 也面临同样的选择。

如果他们对未来完全没有把握，我们就可以说每个人的选择包含一个比特（bit）的信息，因为他们各自都有两种可能性。显然，Steve 和 Bryan 两人未来的可能性信息量至少等于他们每个人单独的信息量。

我们可以这样理解：假设我们得知 Steve 已经离职了。这样关于他的不确定性就消除了。但是我们仍然不知道 Bryan 会怎么选择。此时的不确定性仍然是一个比特，只不过全都集中在 Bryan 的选择上。这个情况和我们之前提到的「如果你喝酒，我就喝酒」的例子本质上是一样的。

有趣的是，虽然这两个例子中的因果关系（causality）不同，但它们却产生了相同的互信息。更重要的是，互信息其实完全不依赖因果关系。即使两方之间没有任何因果联系，它们之间也完全可能存在 100% 的相关性（correlation）。

现在我们可以用熵（entropy）来解释这个现象，熵是我们前面提到的用来衡量系统不确定性（uncertainty）程度的指标。从经典物理学的角度来看，整个系统的熵必须至少与其任何组成部分的熵一样大。

为了便于理解，我们可以把熵比作面积。美国的总面积必定至少与其任何一个州的面积一样大。即使某些州之间有重叠的区域，这个原则也永远成立。用这个比喻来说明：如果你要在整个美国范围内寻找一个人，你面临的不确定性必定至少要比你知道这个人在 California 时的不确定性大。毕竟，除了 California，美国其他地方还有很多可能的藏身处，所以在 California 范围内搜索时的不确定性不可能超过在整个美国范围内搜索的不确定性。

然而，在量子力学中，上述这个看似理所当然的原则却不再成立。在这个问题的量子版本中，如果你把搜索范围限定在 California，反而可能比在整个美国范围内搜索更难找到目标。用我们刚才的比喻来说，在量子世界中，California 的「面积」竟然可能比整个美国的总「面积」还要大！

那么，我们有什么证据能证明量子系统真的会这样表现呢？我猜你现在可能会问：这真的可能吗？这确实看起来很违反直觉。不过，我们可以通过实验来验证这一点，比如用两个自旋电子做实验。

我们可以用特定方式制造这两个电子，使它们的整体状态完全确定，但当我们单独观察任何一个电子时，却会发现它处于一种完全不确定的状态。换句话说，只有将两个电子一起考虑，才能完整描述它们的状态。这种现象在经典物理中是不可能出现的 —— 在经典物理中，如果一个系统处于不确定状态，添加另一个系统绝不可能减少这种不确定性。

这种奇特的现象最终可以追溯到一个事实：在量子物理中，这两个电子之间存在着超强的关联性，有些人将其比作「同卵双胞胎」的关系。也就是说，它们之间存在某种「超出常规」的额外互信息。

那么，如果这就是现实世界的真实运作方式，我们还能用信息理论来描述它吗？答案是肯定的，但显然香农熵（Shannon entropy）已经不够用了。香农信息理论的局限在于：它总是认为整体所包含的信息量至少应该等于其任何部分所包含的信息量。但正如我们所讨论的，这个原则在量子系统中并不成立。因此，我们需要一个比香农提出的更加广义的信息处理方法。

这个理论的关键改变在于将经典的比特概念升级为量子比特或量子位（qubit）。与只能处于 0 或 1 状态的经典比特不同，量子比特是一种量子系统，它可以同时以不同比例存在于这两种状态的任意组合中。除此之外，香农理论的其他所有要素都保持不变。在量化信息时，我们只需要用量子比特的熵来替代经典比特的熵即可。

这一突破最早是由 John Wheeler 的另一位学生 Ben Schumacher 实现的，"qubit」这个术语也是由他创造的。这种从比特到量子比特的转变，虽然看起来很简单，但实际上具有深远的影响。还记得我们前面提到的「整体可能小于部分」的例子吗？在量子信息理论中，两个相关联的量子系统的总量子熵确实可能小于它们每个系统单独的熵。

量子信息理论可以看作是香农信息理论的扩展版本，因为在特定情况下，它可以简化为传统的香农信息理论。除了我们从香农那里学到的内容之外，量子信息还告诉我们：在信息处理领域还存在着大量未被开发的潜力。目前，量子信息理论已经在多个领域得到应用，包括：设计新一代超快速计算机、开发高度安全的加密系统，以及 —— 你可能难以置信 —— 实现物体的量子隔空传送（teleport）。

读者可能会担心：升级到量子信息理论是否会让本书第一部分的结论都变得无效？事实恰恰相反。虽然我们完全可以用量子信息理论来研究 DNA，但因为它是一个宏观现象（macroscopic phenomenon），用经典信息理论就足以完整描述 DNA 最重要的功能。这个道理同样适用于本书第一部分讨论的所有信息处理系统。

理论上，所有这些系统都可以用量子信息理论重新推导，但因为它们都是宏观系统（macroscopic systems），所以用经典信息理论的近似已经足够准确。这并不是说量子物理学不适用于宏观物体 —— 恰恰相反，它适用于宇宙中的所有物质。只不过在宏观层面上，量子物理的预测结果与经典物理的差异并不明显。因此，当我们认为没有必要时，自然不会去处理量子物理带来的额外复杂性。

从信息的角度来看，量子理论有两个最重要的特征：

1. 量子比特可以同时以多种不同状态共存

2. 当我们对量子比特进行测量时，它会被转化为经典状态，即得到一个确定的结果

这两个特征在不同应用场景中可能会表现出优势或劣势。就第一个特征而言，量子比特拥有比经典比特更复杂的结构，这是一个优势，因为它让量子信息处理比经典信息理论拥有更强大的能力和更高的灵活性。但在某些情况下，比如在量子密码学（quantum cryptography）中，如果接收者没有完整的信息，就无法在不破坏量子状态的情况下解读消息，这就成了一个劣势。

测量特征也是如此。从优势来说，在量子密码学中，它能帮助我们检测窃听者（eavesdropper)；但从劣势来说，测量会将量子比特还原为经典比特，从而降低了信息处理能力。

在下一章关于量子计算的讨论中，我们将更详细地探讨量子信息的这些优势和局限。






### Key points

Quantum physics started a hundred years ago, describing how small objects behave.

Two mind-boggling features of quantum physics mark it apart from anything we have seen so far. One is the possibility of objects being in two or more different states at the same time. An atom can be here and there at the same time, for example. The other one is the intrinsic randomness in the behaviour of quantum systems. We simply cannot in most cases tell what a quantum system will do even when we know everything there is to know about it.

Understanding that quantum physics is all about information helps us to develop real world applications to achieve a new order of communications.

Quantum cryptography is one of the areas where quantum physics has demonstrated a new order of information processing, where we can now communicate more securely than we ever thought possible.

Quantum cryptography is not just a theoretical construct; it has been successfully implemented over vast distances.

关键要点：

量子物理学（Quantum physics）起源于一百年前，主要研究微观物体的行为规律。

量子物理有两个令人震惊的特征，这使它与我们之前认识的所有科学理论都截然不同：

第一个特征是物体可以同时处于多个不同的状态。比如，一个原子可以「同时」存在于两个不同的位置 —— 这就好比一个人可以同时出现在办公室和家里一样不可思议。

第二个特征是量子系统具有内在随机性（intrinsic randomness）。即便我们掌握了关于某个量子系统的所有信息，在大多数情况下仍然无法准确预测它接下来会做什么。

认识到量子物理本质上是关于信息的科学，这种理解帮助我们开发出了许多实际应用，从而实现了全新的通信方式。其中，量子密码学（quantum cryptography）就是一个突出的例子。它展示了量子物理带来的革命性信息处理方式，让我们能够实现前所未有的安全通信。

而量子密码学并非停留在理论构想（theoretical construct）阶段，它已经在远距离通信中得到了成功应用。
