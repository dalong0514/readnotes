## 1201Destruction ab Toto: Nothing from Something

The main view promoted by this book is that underlying many different aspects of reality is some form of information processing. The theory of information started rather innocently, as the result of a very specific question that Shannon considered, which was how to maximize the capacity of communication between two users. Shannon showed that all we need is to associate a probability to an event, and defined a metric that allowed you to quantify the information content of that event. Interestingly, because of its simplicity and intuitiveness, Shannon's views have been successfully applied to many other problems. We can view biological information through Shannon's theory as a communication in time (where the objective of natural selection is to propagate the gene pool into the future). But it is not only that communications and biology are trying to optimize information. In physics, systems arrange themselves so that entropy is maximized, and this entropy is quantified in the same way as Shannon's information. We encounter the same form of information in other phenomena. Financial speculation is also governed by the same concept of entropy, and optimizing your profit is the same problem as optimizing your channel capacity. In social theory, society is governed by its interconnectedness or correlation and this correlation itself is quantified by Shannon's entropy.

Underlying all these phenomena was the classical Boolean logic where events had clear outcomes, either yes or no, on or off, and so on. In our most accurate description of reality, given by quantum theory, we know that bits of information are an approximation to a much more precise concept of qubits. Qubits, unlike bits, can exist in a multitude of states, any combination of yes and no, on and off.

Shannon's information theory has been extended to account for quantum theory and the resulting framework, quantum information theory, has already shown a number of advantages. The greater power of quantum information theory is manifested in more secure cryptographic protocols, a completely new order of computing, quantum teleportation, and a number of other applications that were simply not possible according to Shannon's view. However, as quantum information theory is ultimately an extension of Shannon's information theory, under the right conditions the quantum information theory reduces to Shannon's. We also saw some tantalizing indications that biological systems may utilize quantum information to make some processes, such as photosynthesis, more efficient than anything possible according to our classical understanding of information.

The main aim of this book is how to understand reality in terms of information. In this respect it is appropriate to view the whole Universe as a quantum computer, given that this is our most accurate description. Then we estimated the total power of the Universe, a memory of 10 to the power of 100 bits and approximately 10 to the power of 90 bits processed per second. This estimate was possible by dividing the Universe into smaller and smaller units and then making use of the fact that the information content of each of these units is then proportional to its surface area.

So where does the information actually come from? When two people communicate one of them generates the information for the other. Any information in economic or social contexts comes likewise from human interactions. The information in human interaction, i.e. biological systems, comes from the molecular properties of DNA. The behaviour of molecules is ultimately governed by the laws of quantum physics. In this way we can reduce any information that comprises reality down to quantum information. However, we are then still left with the question of where the quantum information comes from.

We now come back to the idea that the whole Universe is digital and we need to decode it in order that we can compress all the information into our laws; laws from which our reality then emerges. The fact that reality is somehow encoded into these laws is by no means novel. The Ancient Greeks, as we saw with Archimedes, understood the Universe that way, as did one of the first ‘proper' scientists, Galileo Galilei.

Here is a quote from Galileo clearly expressing the view that the truths in the Universe are encoded into mathematics: ‘Philosophy is written in this grand book – I mean the Universe – which stands continually open to our gaze, but it cannot be understood unless one first learns to comprehend the language in which it is written. It is written in the language of mathematics, and its characters are triangles, circles, and other geometric figures, without which it is humanly impossible to understand a single word of it; without these, one is wandering about in a dark labyrinth.'

But we want to go beyond Galileo's sentiment in two key respects. First, we want to use information instead of geometric characters. Second, we want to explain how the information in the Universe arises. Once the information is decoded and compressed into appropriately defined laws, we can then understand our reality according to the information encoded in these laws. The laws themselves must be an integral part of this evolving picture. Otherwise we are stuck in an infinite regression. The Universe can therefore be seen as an information processor, in other words a gigantic quantum computer.

This view that the Universe is a computer is also not novel. Konrad Zuse, a famous Polish mathematician who pioneered many cryptographic techniques used during World War II, was the first to view the Universe as a computer. He was followed by a number of other researchers, most notably by the Americans Ed Fredkin and Tom Toffoli, who in the 1970s wrote a number of papers on this very topic. Fredkin is still seen as the leading champion of the digital model of the Universe and its internal workings. The problem, however, is that all these models assume that the Universe is a classical computer. By now, however, we know that the Universe should be understood as a quantum computer.

Our reality evolves because every once in a while we find that we need to edit part of the program that describes reality. We may find that this piece of the program, based on a certain model, is refuted (the underlying model is found to be inaccurate), and hence the program needs to be updated. Refuting a model and changing a part of the program is, as we saw, crucial to changing reality itself because refutations carry much more information than simply confirming a model.

These refutations are manifested as ‘no-go' principles. Physics is littered with them. The Second Law of thermodynamics, which we saw was one of the most general laws of physics, is phrased to prohibit any transfer of heat from a cold to a hot body without any other effect. So, the Second Law would say that while we do not stipulate what physical processes can do, we certainly do know what they cannot do. Whilst we know the ‘known knowns' and ‘known unknowns' we do not know the ‘unknown unknowns'. And this is very powerful, because it is extremely general. The same is true for the theory of relativity, as relativity tells us that you cannot travel faster than the speed of light.

When it comes to quantum mechanics, this ‘no-go' way of speaking stretches our imagination to its limits. When we said that quantum mechanically an object can exist in two different places at once, this state is very difficult to understand using our everyday intuition. In fact, if we use the negative way, we are forced to acknowledge that (in some sense) it is not true that ‘the object is in two places at once' and it is also not true that the object is ‘not in two places at once'. So the statements that ‘an object is in two places at once' as well as its opposite ‘an object is not in two places at once' are both untrue. How can that be? It seems logically impossible that a statement and its negation are both incorrect. While to some this may be a contradiction, to Bohr this pointed to a deeper wisdom. He is reported to have said: ‘A shallow truth is a statement whose opposite is false; a deep truth is a statement whose opposite is also a deep truth'.

However, we do not really need to change the laws of ordinary logic to resolve the quantum conundrum. There is no contradiction here as the two statements refer to two different experimental procedures. When we say that it is not true that the particle is in two places at the same time, this really refers to our detection procedure. When we measure the position of the particle, the particle is always really recorded in one, or the other place, but never in both. This confirms that we indeed have a particle. However, when we do not measure at all, but instead interact with the object in a way that does not record its location, then the object behaves as if it was in both places at the same time. So, two different handlings of the object will reveal two different scenarios for its behaviour. And there is nothing really contradictory about this fact.

However, the emerging reality does depend on what question we ask. We can force objects to adopt different characteristics depending on which particular characteristic we measure. All quantum information is ultimately context dependent. Einstein really did not like this view of reality, which somehow tells you that reality is created through your observations and is therefore not independent of us.

Interestingly enough, there is a very close theological position to the general Popperian philosophy of science and this position is known as the Via Negativa (or the negative way). It was apparently held originally by the Cappadocian Fathers of the fourth century, who based their whole world-view on questions which cannot be answered. For example, they proclaimed that, while they believed in God, they did not believe that God exists. This may appear to be a great contradiction, but it really is not.

As a matter of fact, the negative way was also well known in the East. In Hinduism, the idea of approaching god in terms of Neti, Sanskrit for ‘not this', is very well established and documented from several ancient traditions, including Advaita Vedanta (which also specifies the Universe as single and inseparable, Brahman, whose features can only be grasped in the negative way).

The Cappadocian Fathers believed that one should describe the nature of God by focusing on what God is not rather than on what God is. The basic premise of this ‘negative' (also called apophatic, for Greek ‘what is not') theology is that God is so far beyond human understanding and experience that the only hope we have of getting close to the nature of God is to list all his negative features. And therefore we cannot say that God exists, because existence is a human notion and as such it may not apply to God.

This list of what God is not, compiled by the Cappadocian Fathers, is certainly rather reminiscent of the laws of physics and the general spirit of science. Physicists cannot really tell you what the Universe is or how exactly it behaves (or to be sure, we cannot tell what the ultimate description will be). But we can certainly tell you what it is not. We know that the Earth was not created 4000 years ago. It was much earlier, but we don't quite know exactly when. We don't exactly know how the Earth was created, but we do know that it did not arise by a giant turtle lifting its back above the surface of a cosmic ocean (or that the Earth was not formed before the Sun).

We also believe that the laws of physics are not different on Earth to anywhere else in the Universe, though we don't quite know what the ultimate laws of physics are (maybe quantum, maybe beyond quantum). Science, likewise, cannot really tell us fully about the ultimate origin of everything. Science is constructed more in a way that it tells us what the Universe is ‘not like' rather than what it is like. For example, science tells us that we should not think of the Earth as in the centre of the Universe. Or we should not think of humans as the central point or purpose of evolution. It does not tell us exactly how we should think of humans, but we definitely should not think of them as fundamentally any different to apes, for example.

The Cappadocian Fathers reach the ultimate knowledge of God in the same way that we reach the ultimate understanding of reality. They do it via saying what God is not, whereas we rely on the scientific method of conjectures and refutations which tells us what reality is not. Although the negative way of speaking is in religion frequently (and I think mistakenly) viewed as irrational mysticism, we see that, in fact, it has a very rational basis paralleled in the scientific method.

Through this negative way of describing reality, separating that which is not true from everything else, we compress reality into a set of laws. These laws are then used as correct until proven otherwise. The laws of physics are the compression of reality which, when run on a universal quantum computer, produce reality. But the compressed laws of physics still need this universal quantum computer to produce reality. Since we are trying to explain the origin of everything, where does that computer come from?

But it's even more dramatic than that. We have the laws of Nature, which when run on a computer produce reality. So the laws of Nature need a pre-existing computer to be effective. On the other hand, the functioning of the computer itself needs to be described by some kind of laws. So what came first, the quantum computer or the physical laws? We seem to have a kind of ‘chicken and egg' problem.

However, can the laws and the computer be created at the same time out of nothing? This possibility seems to be very difficult to imagine, but there have been many attempts at it throughout history. One way of doing so, that at least to me does not seem to be very elegant, or even scientifically valid, invokes what is known as the anthropic principle.

The anthropic principle states that the laws of the Universe are the way they are, because if they were different, we would not be here to talk about them. This argument might sound circular to you, but it is not. Any circular argument is, by default, logically correct (although trivially so, because they postulate what they later try to prove; think about the statement ‘I like Jennifer Lopez, because she is my favourite person.') but the anthropic principle may just happen to be plain wrong. We simply do not know if some other laws would also not lead to beings, like us, who can do science and discover laws of Nature. A more modern improvement on the anthropic principle has been promoted by Sir Martin Rees, the British Astronomer Royal and the current president of the Royal Society. In Rees' version, on which he once jokingly bet his dog's life, all possible Universes exist and we only exist in the subset of those that have the right conditions. Let's hope for his dog's sake that he is correct.

Another possible answer, as we have seen, is that someone created the laws and the computer to start with. Traditionally, God has been assumed to be the original information creator. Alas, then we have to explain the origin of God, which is equally difficult.

But just take computers, for instance. In our computers we can design different worlds. Every computer game is, in fact, a simulation of a world with possibly very different rules to our own. This is what makes games very exciting and possibly also very difficult. As games and computers become more and more sophisticated the graphics get better and it becomes more difficult to tell a simulation from the real thing (enter Keanu Reeves, The Matrix).

However we still can't get away from the reliance on God. God in this case is the computer programmer who programmed the software that gives us our Universe. The reason why this answer sits so uneasily with scientists is – as explained – that, although we have an arguably prettier picture, it really only just displaces the question of the origin of information. So, if you tell me that we are someone's simulation, then who created that someone and told them to simulate us?

All answers of this type quickly lead to what is called an infinite regression, which we encountered earlier. For every creator, we seem to need to invent another creator that created it. God created our Universe, and another god created the first god and so on ad infinitum . . . This is no real solution, and cannot form the basis for answers to questions such as ‘How come reality exists?'.

A similar problem of infinite regression led to von Neumman's theory of replication. There he faced the problem that one being has to contain a copy of the next generation which has to contain a copy of the next generation, and so on. It is clear that this kind of logic cannot be sustained in Nature because it requires you to store every future copy in the current version (i.e. an infinite amount of information in a limited amount of space). We simply have to look for some other possible explanation.

Throughout the ages it is interesting to note how the image of a god has changed in line with human knowledge. Prehistoric humans saw a different god in every element of life, and each god had to create that element and thereafter be responsible for it. With the Ancient Greeks, the notion of god was still polytheistic but their gods were smaller in number and correlated to more abstract notions such as love, war, peace, and happiness. There were also several religions that were pursuing a monotheistic view of god, for example Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. In the East we likewise encounter various versions of the principle of cosmic unity (though, in contrast, popular religion was presented in polytheistic terms).

The monotheistic view has survived for over two millennia but God's profession has changed somewhat. To Johannes Kepler, in the sixteenth century, God was a geometer, while for Newton, a century later, God was a physicist who, after creating the laws of physics together with the Universe, sat back and watched reality evolve. In Newton's world, the laws of physics are entirely deterministic and everything happens in an ordered fashion. In the latest incarnation of this story, we are talking about God as a computer scientist, sitting down and programming the Universe.

Although none of these roles that God has played can answer the question of the origin of information, there seems to be a distinct trend to God's role – namely, God seems to be less and less involved. Back in Ancient times, God had to create every little thing in the Universe and was responsible for its subsequent functioning – so you could say he had his work cut out for him. Then with Newton, on the other hand, God only had to create the laws of physics – once God had done this, he could just sit back and relax. It is therefore natural to ask if it's possible to reach a point where creation is so effortless that perhaps we don't even need a Creator.

There is a nice parallel in mathematics to what we are trying to argue for here, which is simply a version of the ‘creation out of nothing'. A fascinating method of creating natural numbers out of empty sets was devised by von Neumann in the 1920s. Here is what he imagined. A set is a collection of things (just like the Universe). An empty set is a collection that contains nothing at all – you can think of this as zero information. Von Neumann proposed that all numbers could be bootstrapped out of the empty set by the operations of the mind.

While this may seems a little odd initially, there is a beautiful logic to it. The mind observes the empty set. It is not difficult to imagine this empty set also containing an empty set within itself. But hold on, now we have an empty set containing an empty set, so does this means that the original set has an element (albeit the element is an empty set)? Yes, the mind has thus generated the number one by producing the set containing the empty set. If we then consider that the empty set contained within the empty set yet contains its own empty set, then the mind has thus generated the number two out of emptiness. It is a set containing the set with nothing in it, and the set with the set with nothing in it (I hope your head is not spinning by now!). And so it continues ad infinitum. In this way, the mind creates all natural numbers, but literally out of nothing – starting from only an empty set. Starting with no information can, using von Neumann's logic, surprisingly lead to a great deal of information. All natural numbers (and there are infinitely many of them) can therefore be created out of an entirely empty set. In other words, we seem to have created an infinite amount of information from zero information.

Note that in von Neumann's beautiful vision, every subsequent creation depends on the previous one. There is a long chain of interdependent (correlated) creations. Each time the mind makes a decision to view the empty set in a different way, a new number appears. Correlations are thus very fundamental to our description and understanding of von Neumann's logic. However outside von Neumann's logic they are also crucial in the real world and manifest themselves through mutual information. It is, in fact, tempting to say that things and events have no meaning in themselves, but that only the shared (mutual) information between them is ‘real'. All properties of physical objects, including their very existence, are only encoded in the relationships between them and hence in the information they share with other physical objects. This is not a particularly new view; this philosophy is already well developed and goes under the general name of ‘relationalism'.

Eastern religion and philosophy have a strong core of relational thinking. In Buddhism, in particular, there is the notion of ‘emptiness' that is akin to von Neumann's empty set. What emptiness means in Buddhism is that ‘things' do not exist in themselves, but are only possible in relation to other ‘things'. For example, think of a chair. What is it really? There is a whole branch of philosophy, known as ontology, devoted to the questions such as ‘What does it mean to be?', or ‘What exists and in what sense is it real?'. I apologize in advance to any ontologists out there and request their forgiveness as I continue to use the minimal amount of technical precision to make what I feel are the salient points needed for subsequent discussion.

Let us all imagine that a chair is just a collection of individual parts, such as armrests, the seat, and so on. Well, it could be, but all of these are just labels. Armrests and seats do not really exist independently of the context, e.g. you cannot have an armrest without the concept of a ‘chair' (let's assume only chairs have armrests) or the concept of an ‘arm'.

In search for the essence of ‘chairness', that which defines a chair independently of anything else, can we not just say that a chair is a collection of atoms in the shape of a chair? But ultimately an atom is also a label for a system containing some positively and some negatively charged particles as well as some neutral particles. And these have all been labelled by us (an electron, a proton, and a neutron). If you ask what an electron is, the answer would be a small negatively charged particle, but all this is just a big label that tells us how this particle behaves in various experiments (such as, it repels some particles and attracts others). It is ultimately a ‘label' to describe the various sorts of behaviour that electrons exhibit when we try to interact with them and manipulate them. Without this label we would have to call an electron something like ‘You know that particle that does X when we test Y and it does P when we look at it in Q, and so on'. In this way we can see that labels are awfully convenient and efficient. But Buddhism tells us that we should not confuse the label with the object. More importantly, just because we have a label for something, it does not mean that this something is real.

Quantum physics is indeed very much in agreement with Buddistic emptiness. The famous British astronomer Arthur Eddington put it this way: ‘The term "particle" survives in modern physics but very little of its classical meaning remains. A particle can now best be defined as the conceptual carrier of a set of variates . . . It is also conceived as the occupant of a state defined by the same set of variates . . . It might seem desirable to distinguish the "mathematical fictions" from "actual particles"; but it is difficult to find any logical basis for such a distinction. Discovering a particle means observing certain effects which are accepted as proof of its existence.'

Eddington claims here that a particle is just a set of labels that we use to describe outcomes of our measurements. And that's it. It all boils down to a relation between our measurements and our labels! The complexity that we see around us in this world (and this complexity we believe to be growing with time, as far as life is concerned at least) is just due to the growing interconnectedness.

In this way, can we now analyse how we encode reality? By doing so, we will never arrive at ‘the thing in itself' by any kind of means. Everything that exists, exists by convention and labelling and is therefore dependent on other things. So, Buddhists would say that their highest goal – realizing emptiness – simply means that we realize how inter-related things fundamentally are. Exactly the same is true in other Eastern religions. Less well known in the West is Advaita Vedanta – a Hindu philosophy that emphasizes the total oneness of the Universe. In this view our perceptions of separate entities is just an illusion – Maya. Even the Universe as a whole only exists by labelling and not by itself. Our reality is ‘that which is the sum total of all the observations and facts humanity has gathered so far'!

We have reached a point where any particle of matter (such as an atom) and energy (such as a photon) in the Universe is defined with respect to an intricate procedure that is used to detect it. If the detector makes a click (like a Geiger counter) the particle is detected. The click itself creates one extra bit of information comprising reality. The crucial point is that the particle does not exist independently of the detector.

But what exactly constitutes a click for any detector such as a Geiger counter? A click is the positive result of any experimental procedure capable of detecting the presence of a particle. This is done by generating a specific interaction between the experimental apparatus and the spatial region in which we are searching for the particle. The interaction needs to be carefully engineered – some interactions simply will not be able to serve this purpose, i.e. they will not give us the relevant bit of information. Going back to the photon example, a beam-splitter will not give us any information as to the existence of the photon. Nothing in the beam-splitter retains any record of the presence or absence of the photon that might have gone through. In other words, beam-splitters cannot produce clicks. If we want a click we have to use something instead of or in addition to beam-splitters, such as photomultipliers. Photomultipliers are designed so that the presence of a photon knocks out one electron, whose motion triggers an electrical current whose presence is amplified to the macroscopic level. This results in a click that we can hear, or any other effect that we can register with our senses.

We can push this a bit further, however. We can ask if the particle is the cause for the detector to click. The answer is no. The reason is that in quantum physics, as we have argued, particles exist and don't exist at the same time. Here I don't just mean that they exist in different places, I mean that even in one place a particle can exist and not exist simultaneously. This too is a direct consequence of quantum indeterminacy. What would this mean in the beam-splitter example discussed earlier? It means that a photon simultaneously enters and does not enter it and this implies that the only time it will be detected at the output is when it does exist. Whether the detector clicks or not is a genuinely random event that cannot be predicted by any means, in the same way that we cannot predict the photon's reflection at the beam-splitter. This implies that we should not say that an existing particle causes the click just like we cannot say that photon's reflection caused a click (since we know that it also passes through). The click has no cause at all and therefore we have no underlying particles.

And since there are no underlying particles in reality, there are no things in the Universe that are made up of particles existing without the intricate procedures to detect them. Detection events are genuinely random and the emerging reality is seen in the correlations, expressed as laws of physics, between the events, which are bits of information. If the link between the information compression and randomness is as Kolmogorov and Chaitin thought, then this conclusion is likely to hold no matter what underlying theory of Nature we discover in the future.

Reality is made up of quantum bits, each arising from a causeless click. A click entirely without a cause has the novel property that it introduces a discontinuity in time. Once an event is recorded, it is solidified forever in the Universe. It becomes an element of what we call the past. However, before the event occurs, we have an uncertainty as to when and if it will happen. All possibilities are then present at the same time and the game is completely open. The occurrence of the event then belongs to something we call the future. Fundamental randomness at the core of reality therefore allows us to have a distinction between the solidified, unchanging, past and a fluid, dynamic, future.

The distinction between the past and future separated by a discontinuity due to a measurement is always relative to the observer who recorded the measurement click. Someone who is able to control the observer and his interactions with the environment, would, according to our current understanding of quantum mechanics, be able to reverse the detection and thereby erase the observer's past. There is no contradiction here, it is purely an interplay between local information (that of the observer) and global information (that of the person who reverses the observation by manipulating the observer and environment).

An amazing issue to note is this. The above meditation in realizing emptiness is a very similar exercise to von Neumann's number creation out of empty sets; it just goes in the exact opposite direction. Von Neumann went from an empty set into an infinite set of real numbers and here we started with macroscopic objects and deconstructed them to find that actually there is nothing behind them, they are based on randomness, on no prior information.

This is the darkness of reality! Anything that exists in this Universe, anything to which you can attribute any kind of reality, only exists by virtue of the mutual information it shares with other objects in the Universe. Underneath this, nothing else exists, nothing else has any underlying reality and hence there is no infinite regression. It just has to be this way, as otherwise we are asking a finite Universe to contain an infinite amount of information – and this is clearly not possible!

Following this logic, it's more accurate to think of the evolution of the Universe as starting with all potential realities from which one reality simply emerges. From this initial state, which contains all possible subsequent futures, the first event occurs without any cause (i.e. a random event) and this gives us our first bit of information. So from all possible futures, now we have a smaller number of futures simply because the first event has occurred in a specific way and all subsequent events will have this event as their past. In this way mutual information is established between bits.

Here we can draw an analogy with sculpting. A sculptor starts with a block of stone out of which he intends to make a sculpture. In some sense, we can say that the initial untouched block contains all the possible sculptures to be made. This is a bit like our initial Universe where all possible realities exist at the same time, but are not actualized. The sculptor then makes the first move, and chisels a piece away from the block. This first cut by the artist breaks the symmetry and reduces the information contained in the initial block. We now no longer have all possible sculptures available to us as some of them, which required the piece that was chiselled away, can now no longer be realized.

For example, think of Michelangelo standing in front of a six metre block of stone, just about to begin work on his sculpture of David. David now stands proudly at five metres tall in the Galleria dell'Accademia in Florence, the masterpiece of a Renaissance genius. Imagine if the first move of this genius was a slip, where he cuts horizontally, so that he now has two smaller blocks each of height three metres. So he can still make a statue but would no longer be the same David. Imagine now that he makes another mistake, this would clearly impact what could or couldn't be created from the remaining block of stone. His possibilities are therefore reduced.

And so it continues, with every next move that the sculptor makes the number of possible futures decrease. Once the sculpture is finished, one possibility is crystallized. Even then, there are more things that could be done to change the sculpture, so we never really arrive at something final. Whenever we think we have something final, the sculptor can always make another cut. Of course, what happens when there are no cuts left to be made? Is this a realistic scenario? From what we have argued, this will never happen in the Universe, as a change of perspective generates new ideas and new information as to what the shape of reality could be. Through successively smaller and smaller alterations the sculptor will always be able to make another cut to whatever is left.

This very way of thinking about the Universe completely and faithfully embodies the spirit of how science operates. We gather information about the Universe by observing different things and these observations then go on to shape our reality. In this way reality emerges around us in a definite and concrete manner. However, since the information we gain from the Universe is defined through an observer, the question is how do we define this observer – do we have a universal observer whose observations we can trust beyond any doubt? Well, apart from bringing in the concept of a supernatural being (which is always a bit of a cop-out), every other observer seems as good as any other to define his or her reality.

In Chapter 2 we found ourselves defining reality through Calvino's card game. In this card game each player represents an observer, and in turn each observer represents a different aspect of reality (economics, physics, biology, social science, computer science, and philosophy). Each observer communicates what he has experienced through a sequence of playing cards. Physics would be telling us about physical laws, such as, if we drop an apple it will fall to the ground, or if we heat water beyond a certain temperature it will become steam. In the same way economics, biology, and all the other observers will also have their own story to tell.

Each observer at the table, as well as telling their own story, will listen to every other player's story. In this way reality emerges through the sharing of information between the players. For example, to date, the cards that have been revealed by physics indicate that the fastest speed of travel is the speed of light. This is not to say that in the future physics may not show us another card which then tells us that under certain conditions we could travel faster than the speed of light. Whilst the players are consistent in their stories, our interpretation of what we are observing evolves to a better and better approximation the longer we are given to observe. Just as in an everyday conversation, only hearing half the story inevitably only gives you a fraction of the information – and you may even get the wrong message entirely. Unfortunately, to wait for this game to be finished before making sense of its information content would require us to wait for the age of the Universe – so instead we are continually guessing at defining reality as best we can.

Each of the players communicates their story through the cards. These cards are assumed to be predefined (like a language) and enable the players to communicate their story. From our previous discussions can we say anything about where these cards come from? Actually we can. We have seen previously in this chapter that although information does come in discrete units (such as cards or bits of information), actually these discrete units are based on a fundamental level of randomness. So if the cards themselves have some element of randomness (i.e. sometimes a card could represent ‘force' and sometimes it could represent ‘peace') then how is it that anyone is able to tell a consistent story with these cards? Surely it would be impossible to tell a story with cards which are not well defined – it just doesn't seem logical! It is counterintuitive that although we seem to perceive a well-defined reality around us, quantum physics suggests that there is no underlying single reality in the Universe independent of us – and that our reality is actually only defined if and when we observe it.

For example, when a particle of light, a photon, encounters a piece of glass like your bedroom window, two outcomes can occur. One outcome is that the photon can be reflected, and the other one is that it can pass through the window. Quantum physics tells us that if we observe the photon we will never be able to predict the outcome in advance, this process is completely random. But what happens if we do not observe the photon? Then quantum physics suggests that the photon takes both alternatives: it both goes through the glass and is also reflected – it exists in two places simultaneously, i.e. there are two distinct realities!

But we only seem to see one reality around us, you never see the same person existing in two different places at the same time. So how does the act of observation allow one reality to emerge out of two or more realities? Quantum physics seems to imply that reality somehow emerges through interactions between observers and the observed. This is reminiscent of a magician's trick, where the main point is to make a card appear from a pack of cards within which it didn't exist. To make this point clearer, let me convey the same message through a simple game.

Suppose you have four players, each of whom is given four cards at the beginning of the game. The goal of the game is for a player to obtain four of the same cards (four aces, four tens, etc.) by exchanging cards with other players. The first person to do this is the winner. There are, however, a couple of rules. The first rule is that you can only ask for a card if you already have at least one of those cards. So you can only ask someone for an ace, if you are holding at least one ace. Now if the person says no, that means they do not have an ace and the game passes to the next player. If they do have the card, they must give it to you and then you have the option of asking the same player again or another player. When you ask for an ace, all other players immediately know that you have at least one ace. The next player in turn then knows what to get from you. Of course this is a very simple game and really doesn't need more than a couple of rounds to find a winner.

The amazing thing is that we don't really need cards to play the game. This is where it gets interesting. The whole game can be played just inside the players' heads where each player imagines four completely arbitrary cards, which is non-standard, in that there is no limit on what image can be on any card or how many of these images exist. For example, one person could imagine three elephant cards and a crocodile card, whilst someone else could imagine two aces and two apple cards. As long as we add the requirement that you can't start with four of the same cards then we know that you must be forced to ask at least one question. Surprisingly whilst there seems to be an infinite number of combinations, this is actually not a problem and we can always find a winner. The saving grace is that the players cannot change any choices that would affect the consistency of the game so far, although they can change their cards throughout the game. For example, if you've asked someone else for a card, then you must at least possess a card of that type. And if someone has asked for a particular card then they must give up that card if it has been asked for by someone else. This requirement of consistency and the ability to change your cards to win the game is what quickly narrows down the multitude of different possibilities as the game proceeds. Both answering and asking a question affects both the cards that you hold and the cards the other players hold. In this way this imagined version without physical cards or limits reduces to the fixed game and we ultimately end up with a definite winner.

This constant questioning is analogous to experimentation in physics, where we start by observing an infinite number of possibilities; however through interaction with the system and by modifying our experiments in line with the information available, this reduces to a smaller set of possible outcomes and then to an eventual winner, a single reality. Experiments too have to be consistent with the rules of the game, the laws of physics. Reality is therefore created by experiments in the same way that cards become created in this imaginary card game. Through this analogy, I hope the reader gets a feel for the bizarreness of quantum mechanics.

I said that information in the Universe is indeed very much like Calvino had imagined. It is discrete (and we saw why this is advantageous when we talked about DNA and life), it is context dependent and it is finite. The crucial aspect missing in Calvino's card game is that in reality, there are no cards. Nature does not give us cards to start with; this is a special no-go theorem of quantum physics excluding the so-called hidden variables. We have to create the cards ourselves through observations.

The proper analogy between cards and information in the Universe is a combination of Calvino's card game with the one we described earlier. Imagine that each player has a different set of cards, and each card has no predefined meaning. This means that just like the sculptor, who when he starts with the block of stone can carve any shape, we have the initial conditions to define any reality that we care to, because at the beginning of the game all possible realities can potentially exist.

As you question other people to gather your cards, your life story unfolds in an unpredictable way, a way that depends on what cards other people tell you they possess. This process is not fixed by anything other than the consistency of the stories they have already told. For example, if physics told us that it dropped an apple which fell to the ground, then it cannot later change its story that the apple did not fall to the ground – the event has been defined and communicated and now it exists on record and cannot be changed. If we later discover that under some circumstances the apple does not fall to the ground, this does not contradict the player's story, it just adds a new insight – in that under certain conditions it may not fall.

The main feature of the ‘card game without cards' is precisely the fact that cards emerge out of nowhere. We start with no information at all (or with infinite information, as is more appropriate, since all possibilities are open). Anything is possible as far as card arrangements and signs are concerned. Then we start questioning and out emerges a definite order. Questions, because they are subject to a (very small) set of rules, reveal a certain type of reality that was not there before (or without) the questions. In a typical card game all the cards are fixed when dealt, but this is clearly not so in our game.

Touching upon that sensitive issue of having cards without any cards existing in the first place, the British chemist Peter Atkins offers an explanation: ‘In the beginning there was nothing. Absolute void, not merely empty space. There was no space; nor was there time, for this was before time. The Universe was without form and void. By chance there was a fluctuation and a set of points, emerging from nothing and taking their existence from the pattern they formed, defined a time.' Then the space (and therefore cards) gets created in a similar way and the rest is history. This version of events looks appealing, but the trouble is that the initial fluctuation that leads to everything is difficult to quantify without any prior theory, i.e. without the rules of the card game. In order to define the size and probability of a fluctuation, we usually need more information, like, for example, knowledge of quantum theory, one of the key rules of the game.

Just as we need the laws of physics to describe events, events themselves need the laws of physics to happen. So, which of the two came first? If we imagine that the laws of physics came first and they then dictate how events unfold, are we really being consistent? Laws of physics become laws because there are events which consistently produce outcomes in accordance with those laws. Events are therefore the material onto which the laws are written. In order for the laws of physics to come first, this would mean that there were no prior events in accordance with this law and therefore the question remains whether this is a law at all, though as we have seen, mutual information can arise out of no overall information and events themselves can happen without any prior rule.

Leibniz's logic was that the simplest possible state of the Universe is the one that contains nothing, so the fact that we see something is for him the best proof for the existence of God. However, in our picture, having nothing at the beginning corresponds to no information. In Shannon's theory this would mean zero entropy of the whole Universe. Any subsequent information gain is not necessarily proof for the existence of God because, as we have seen, mutual information can be ultimately generated locally even though the information overall remains zero.

We can construct our whole reality in this way by looking at it in terms of two distinct but inter-related arrows of knowledge. We have the spontaneous creation of mutual information in the Universe as events unfold, without any prior cause. This kicks off the interplay between the two arrows. On the one hand, through our observations and a series of conjectures and refutations, we compress the information in the Universe into a set of natural laws. These laws are the shortest programs to represent all our observations. On the other hand, we run these programs to generate our picture of reality. It is this picture that then tells us what is, and isn't, possible to accomplish, in other words, what our limitations are.

The Universe starts empty but potentially with a huge amount of information. The key event that gives the Universe some direction is the first act of ‘symmetry breaking', the first cut of the sculptor. This act, which we consider as completely random, i.e. without any prior cause, just decides on why one tiny aspect in the Universe is one way rather than another. This first event sets in motion a chain reaction in which, once one rule has been decided, the rest of the Universe needs to proceed in a consistent manner. Just like in Calvino's card game, the next piece of the story must be consistent with the previous.

This is where the first arrow of knowledge begins. We compress the spontaneous, yet consistent information in the Universe, into a set of natural laws that continuously evolve as we test and discard the erroneous ones. Just as man evolved through a compression of biological information (a series of optimizations for the changing environment), our understanding of the Universe (our reality) has also evolved as we better synthesize and compress the information that we are presented with into more and more accurate laws of Nature. This is how the laws of Nature emerge, and these are the physical, biological, and social principles that our knowledge is based on.

The second arrow of knowledge is the flip-side to the first arrow. Once we have the laws of Nature, we explore their meaning in order to define our reality, in terms of what is and isn't possible within it. It is a necessary truth that whatever our reality, it is based exclusively on our understanding of these laws. For example, if we have no knowledge of natural selection, all of the species look independently created and without any obvious connection. Of course this is all dynamic in that when we find an event that doesn't fit our description of reality, then we go back and change the laws, so that the subsequently generated reality also explains this event.

The basis for these two arrows is the darkness of reality, a void from which they were created and within which they operate. Following the first arrow, we ultimately arrive at nothing (ultimately there is no reality, no law without law). The second arrow then lifts us from this nothingness and generates a picture of reality as an interconnected whole.

So our two arrows seem to point in opposite directions to one another. The first compresses the information available into succinct knowledge and the second decompresses the resulting laws into a colourful picture of reality. In this sense our whole reality is encoded into the set of natural laws. We already said that there was an overall direction for information flow in the Universe, i.e. that entropy (disorder) in the Universe can only increase. This gives us a well-defined directionality to the Universe, commonly known as the ‘arrow of time'. So how do our two arrows of knowledge stand in relation to the arrow of time?

The first arrow of knowledge clearly acts like a Maxwell's demon. It constantly combats the arrow of time and tirelessly compresses disorder into something more meaningful. It connects seemingly random and causeless events into a string of mutually inter-related facts. The second arrow of knowledge, however, acts in the opposite direction of increasing the disorder. By changing our view of reality it instructs us that there are more actions we can take within the new reality than we could with the previous, more limited view.

Within us, within all objects in the Universe, lie these two opposing tendencies. So, is this a constant struggle between new information and hence disorder being created in the Universe, and our efforts to order this into a small set of rules? If so, is this a losing battle? How can we ever compete with the Universe?

从无到有的彻底毁灭

这本书的核心观点是，现实世界中诸多看似不同的层面，都可以归结为某种形式的信息处理。信息理论最初源于香农（Shannon）对通信领域的一个朴实问题：如何最大化两个用户之间的信息传输能力。他的关键洞见在于，只需为每个事件赋予概率，就能定义一个衡量信息内容的度量标准。

令人惊讶的是，由于这一理论的简洁和直观，香农的观点已被广泛应用于各个领域。例如，在生物学中，我们可以将自然选择视为一种跨越时间的信息传播，其目标是不断延续和优化基因库。

不仅如此，这种信息处理的逻辑似乎是普遍存在的。在物理学中，系统会自发地朝着熵最大化的方向演变，而这个熵的计算方法与信息量的计算惊人地相似。同样的原理也适用于金融投机：优化利润，本质上就是优化信息传输的效率。

即便在社会科学领域，这一理论同样适用。社会的运转依赖于成员之间的相互联系与关联，而这种关联程度恰恰可以用香农熵来量化。

传统的布尔逻辑曾经主导我们理解世界：事物要么是，要么不是，就像开关只有开和关两种状态。然而，在量子世界里，事情变得更加有趣。量子理论揭示了量子比特（qubit）的神奇之处：它们不再局限于传统的「是」或「否」，而可以同时存在于多种状态，就像一个开关既可以是开，也可以是关，甚至可以处于开和关之间的任何可能状态。

信息论之父香农的经典理论已被拓展到量子领域，诞生了量子信息理论这一全新的科学分支。这一理论展现出令人惊叹的潜力：它不仅能设计更安全的加密协议，还开启了量子计算这一革命性的计算模式，甚至实现了闻所未闻的量子传态技术。

更妙的是，量子信息理论并非与经典信息论割裂，而是其自然延伸。在特定条件下，它可以完美还原香农最初的理论框架。这种理论的连续性，展现了科学发展的优雅与连贯。

令人兴奋的是，科学家们已经发现，生命系统可能早已「偷偷」运用量子信息机制。以光合作用为例，植物似乎能通过量子效应，将能量转换过程的效率提升到远超传统物理学想象的水平。这无疑为我们理解生命的本质提供了全新的视角。

本书的核心旨在探讨如何从信息的视角理解现实。在这一点上，将整个宇宙视为一台量子计算机是最恰当不过的，因为这是目前我们对宇宙最精确的描述。我们估算了宇宙的计算能力：大约有 10^100 比特的存储空间，并且每秒可以处理约 10^90 比特的信息。这个令人惊叹的估算是通过不断将宇宙分割成更小的单元，并发现每个单元的信息内容与其表面积成正比而得出的。

那么，信息究竟源于何处？当两个人交流时，其中一方为另一方创造信息。无论是经济还是社会领域的信息，都源自人类的互动。再往深处看，人类互动中的信息 - 或者说生物系统中的信息 - 来自 DNA 的分子特性。而分子的行为最终遵循量子物理学的基本定律。通过这种方式，我们可以将构成现实的所有信息追溯到最基本的量子信息。不过，这又引发了一个更深层次的哲学问题：量子信息本身又从何而来？

我们现在回到一个深刻的观点：整个宇宙本质上是数字化的，我们需要通过解码来将所有信息压缩成基本定律；正是从这些定律中，我们的现实得以呈现。这种现实被编码在法则中的看法并不新鲜。正如我们在阿基米德那里看到的，古希腊人已经以这种方式理解宇宙，早期的科学家伽利略·伽利雷也持有同样的观点。

伽利略用令人印象深刻的语言清晰地阐述了宇宙真理被数学编码的观点："哲学写在这本宏大的书中 ── 我指的是宇宙 ── 它持续地向我们展开，但若不先学会理解其中的语言，就无法真正领悟。这本书用数学语言书写，其中的」字符「是三角形、圆形和其他几何图形。没有这些，人类将无法理解其中的一个字；没有这些，人们只会在黑暗的迷宫中徘徊。"

我们希望在两个关键方面超越伽利略的传统观点。首先，我们不再局限于几何图形和符号，而是转向更抽象的信息描述。其次，我们力图揭示宇宙信息的生成机制。当这些信息被解码并压缩成精确的自然定律时，我们就能够通过这些定律中蕴含的信息来理解现实世界。这些定律不仅仅是描述现实，更是现实演化过程中不可或缺的组成部分。如果忽视了这一点，我们将陷入无休止的循环解释中。因此，宇宙可以被理解为一个终极的信息处理系统，或者说是一台规模宏大的量子计算机。

将宇宙视为一台计算机并非新鲜观点。在二战期间开创密码技术的波兰数学家康拉德·祖瑟，最早提出了这一观念。美国学者埃德·弗雷德金和汤姆·托佛利在 1970 年代对此进行了深入研究，弗雷德金更是成为宇宙数字模型的代表性人物。然而，这些早期模型都将宇宙视为传统的经典计算机，而如今我们已经认识到，宇宙应该被理解为一台量子计算机。

我们的现实不断演进，是因为我们需要不时修改描述现实的「程序」。当某个模型被证明不准确时，我们就会更新相应的部分。有趣的是，这种模型的否证和程序的更新过程本身就是改变现实的关键。因为否证所揭示的信息，往往比单纯确认一个模型更加深刻和有价值。

物理学中充满了这些「禁止性」原则。这些原则本质上是对物理过程的否定性限制。热力学第二定律 —— 这是物理学最普遍的定律之一 —— 明确指出：在没有任何额外作用的情况下，热量不能自发地从冷体传递到热体。换言之，我们虽然不会预先规定物理过程的具体可能性，但我们清楚地知道某些事情是不可能发生的。

就像我们对「已知事项」和「已知的未知领域」有所了解，但对「未知的未知」仍然茫然一样，这种否定性原则反而具有极大的科学价值。它们普遍而深刻。相对论也遵循类似逻辑，明确告诉我们不可能突破光速的限制。

在量子力学这个学科中，这种逻辑悖论的表述方式将我们的认知能力推向了极限。当我们说量子力学中一个物体可以同时存在于两个不同的位置时，这种量子叠加态（Quantum Superposition）完全超出了我们日常经验的理解范畴。事实上，如果我们从否定的角度来看，我们不得不承认：从本体论的角度，"物体同时存在于两个地方」这一陈述是不成立的，而「物体不同时存在于两个地方」的否定陈述同样也不成立。换言之，"物体同时存在于两个地方」以及其对立面「物体不同时存在于两个地方」这两个看似矛盾的陈述，竟然都不能被视为真实。这在传统逻辑中似乎是不可想象的 —— 一个陈述及其否定同时都是错误的，这如何在逻辑上成立？

对于普通人来说，这可能是一个不可理解的悖论。然而，对于量子物理奠基人之一的尼尔斯·玻尔（Niels Bohr）来说，这恰恰揭示了认知的更深层次本质。他著名地阐述："浅层真理是那些对立面为假的陈述；而深层真理则是那些对立面同样是深刻真理的陈述」。这句话不仅适用于量子力学，更是对认知边界的哲学思考。

解决量子悖论并不需要改变传统逻辑。这两个看似矛盾的陈述实际上描述了不同的实验过程。当我们说粒子不可能同时存在于两个地方时，指的是我们的测量方法。在进行位置测量时，粒子总是被记录在某一个确定的位置，而非同时出现在两处。这证实了粒子的确定性。

有趣的是，当我们不直接测量粒子位置，而是以一种不记录具体位置的方式与其交互时，粒子就会呈现出一种奇特的状态 —— 仿佛同时存在于多个位置。换言之，观测方式的不同会导致粒子呈现出截然不同的行为特征。这并非真正的矛盾，而是量子世界独特的本质。

在量子世界里，现实是出人意料的灵活多变。不同的观察角度会让同一个对象呈现出截然不同的特性，就好比用不同的镜头观察同一幅画，会看到完全不同的画面。量子信息天生就带有一种「随机应变」的特质，它随着观察者的视角和测量方式而改变。

爱因斯坦对这种看似任性的量子世界深感不安。这种观点挑战了传统的客观现实概念，暗示现实并非独立存在，而是在观察的瞬间被「创造」出来。

在神学和科学哲学领域，有一种有趣的思考方式叫做「否定之路」（Via Negativa）。早在四世纪，卡帕多西亚的教父们就提出了这种独特的认知方法：他们认为，有些最深奥的真理恰恰在于我们无法直接描述它们。比如，他们会说："我们相信上帝，但不能说上帝 ' 存在 '」。这看似是个矛盾，实则是一种深刻的辩证思维，强调了认知的局限性和 mystery 的永恒性。

事实上，通过否定来认识事物的方法在东方哲学中由来已久。在印度教的不二论（Advaita Vedanta）传统中，"Neti」（梵语，意为「不是这个"）是一种重要的认知路径。这一传统认为，宇宙是单一且不可分割的整体，称为「梵（Brahman)」，其本质只能通过否定的方式来理解。

早期基督教的卡帕多西亚教父们也持有类似观点，他们主张通过描述「神不是什么」来接近神的本质，而非说明「神是什么」。这种被称为「否定神学（Apophatic Theology)」的思想认为，神已经超越了人类的理解和经验范畴。要接近神的本质，唯一可行的方法就是列举神所不具备的特征。从这个角度看，甚至连说「神存在」这个陈述都是不恰当的，因为「存在」本身是一个人类有限的概念。

卡帕多西亚教父编写的关于「上帝定义」的清单，颇让人联想到科学探索的基本精神。就像科学家在描述宇宙时常常选择的方法一样，首先说明「不是什么」，而非绝对肯定「是什么」。物理学家虽然无法精确描述宇宙的本质，却能清晰地阐明宇宙不符合哪些假设。

譬如，我们确定地球并非仅存在了 4000 年，它的历史要远远早于此。尽管无法准确指出地球形成的具体时间，但科学家们已经排除了许多不可能的形成理论。比如，地球绝非如某些神话所描述的，是由一只巨大乌龟支撑，也不可能在太阳之前就已存在。这种「先排除」的科学思维方法，恰恰体现了严谨的学术态度。

我们相信物理定律在地球上与宇宙任何地方都是一致的，尽管我们尚未完全揭示这些基础性的自然法则（可能是量子层面的，也可能存在更深层的物理机制）。同样，科学也无法全然解释万物的根本起源。科学的本质更多在于阐明宇宙的「非」，而非直接描述宇宙的「是」。例如，科学告诉我们不应将地球视为宇宙的中心，也不应认为人类是进化的核心或终极目标。科学并不能精确地指导我们如何看待人类，但它明确指出，我们不应将人类视为与其他生物（如大猿）有本质区别。

卡帕多西亚教父探索上帝的终极本质，其方法与科学家理解现实的路径惊人地相似。他们通过不断排除「上帝不是什么」来接近真理，这与科学家运用「猜想 — 反驳」方法，逐步排除错误认知以接近真相的思路如出一辙。尽管这种否定性思维在宗教领域常被误解为神秘主义，但实际上，它与科学探索具有高度相似的理性基础。

通过这种否定性描述，科学家和宗教思想家都在不断缩小真理的范围。就像物理学家将复杂现实浓缩为一套基本定律，这些定律在通用量子计算机上可以重现现实本身。但这引发了一个根本性哲学问题：组成这些定律和计算机的终极系统是从何而来的？这个追问，跨越了科学与形而上学的边界。

更有趣的是，这个问题远比表面看起来复杂。自然界的基本法则似乎就像一套精密的计算程序，当被「执行」时，就会呈现出我们所感知的现实世界。这就引发了一个哲学性的鸡生蛋还是蛋生鸡的根本悖论：是基本物理法则先存在，还是执行这些法则的「计算底层」先出现？

物理学家们长期思考着这个看似不可能解决的谜题：这些构成现实的基本法则和支持它们的计算机制，是否可能凭空同时产生？尽管这个想法听起来近乎荒谬，但科学家们从未停止探索。其中最具争议的解释之一，是引入所谓的「人择原理」— 一个试图从观测者的角度解释宇宙起源的理论框架。

人类中心原理（anthropic principle）阐述了一个有趣的宇宙观：宇宙的基本法则之所以是现在这个样子，是因为如果它们稍有不同，我们就不可能存在并讨论这些法则。这个论点乍听起来像是循环推理，但实际上并非如此。

循环论证通常在逻辑上是自洽的（比如「我喜欢詹妮弗·洛佩兹，因为她是我最喜欢的人"），但人类中心原理可能完全是错误的。我们无法确定是否存在另一套物理法则，同样能够孕育像我们这样具有科学探索能力的生命。

英国皇家学会现任主席马丁·里斯爵士对这一原理提出了更现代的诠释。在他的版本中，宇宙是多元的：所有可能的宇宙都同时存在，而我们仅仅存在于具备适当生存条件的那个宇宙子集中。里斯曾经打趣说，他甚至愿意用自己的狗作赌注来支持这个观点 —— 希望看在他狗的份上，这个理论是正确的。

另一种可能的解释是，正如我们已经看到的，有人最初创造了宇宙的法则和计算机。传统上，人们认为上帝是最初的信息创造者。然而，这又引出了一个同样棘手的问题：上帝的起源从何而来？

以计算机为例。在我们的计算机中，我们可以设计完全不同的虚拟世界。每个计算机游戏本质上都是一个可能具有与现实世界截然不同规则的世界模拟。正是这种差异性使游戏变得如此令人兴奋，同时也充满挑战。随着游戏和计算机技术不断进步，图形越来越逼真，以至于越来越难以分辨虚拟与现实（就像基努·里维斯主演的电影《黑客帝国》）。

尽管如此，我们仍然无法摆脱对「创造者」的依赖。在这种情况下，这个「创造者」就是程序员，是他们编写了构建我们宇宙的软件。科学家对这种解释感到如此不安，是因为这个看似更加优雅的理论，实际上并没有真正解决信息起源的根本问题。换句话说，如果你告诉我们是某人的模拟，那么又是谁创造了那个模拟我们的人，并赋予他们这个任务呢？

所有这类回答很快会陷入无限退行（ad infinitum）的困境，这是我们早已 encountered 的问题。对于每一个创造者，我们似乎都需要假设另一个更高层级的创造者。例如，如果说上帝创造了宇宙，那么又是谁创造了上帝？这种无穷无尽的追溯无法提供真正的解释，也不能回答诸如「现实为何存在」这样的根本性哲学问题。

类似的无限退行逻辑在冯·诺伊曼（von Neumann）关于复制（replication）的理论中也有体现。他面临的核心问题是：如果一个生命体必须包含下一代的完整信息，而下一代又必须包含再下一代的信息，这种模式将无限延续。显然，这种逻辑在自然界是不可能实现的，因为它要求在有限的空间内存储无限量的信息。因此，我们必须寻找其他可能的解释途径。

在人类文明的漫长历程中，神的形象随着认知的演进不断变化，颇为有趣。在史前时代，人们相信自然界的每一个元素都由不同的神灵掌控 —— 每位神都肩负着创造和管理特定领域的职责。到了古希腊时期，神的概念依然是多神论，但众神的数量大大减少，并且开始与更加抽象的概念产生关联，如爱情、战争、和平与幸福。与此同时，犹太教、基督教和伊斯兰教等宗教开始追求一神论的信仰。在东方文明中，我们也能看到类似的宇宙和谐观念，尽管表面上仍以多神信仰的形式呈现。

单一神论观点历经两千余年而屹立不倒，但人们对上帝的理解却在悄然演变。在 16 世纪，开普勒眼中的上帝是一位精通几何的设计师；到了一个世纪后，牛顿则将上帝视为一位物理学家，他创造了物理法则和宇宙，随后静静地观察现实的自然演进。在牛顿的世界观中，物理定律是完全确定的，万物以严丝合缝的方式有序运转。而在这个故事的最新篇章里，我们将上帝想象为一位计算机科学家，正端坐着，为整个宇宙编写程序。

尽管这些关于宇宙创造的阐释无法解答信息起源的根本问题，但在描述宇宙生成的叙事中，似乎存在一个关于创造力的清晰演进趋势 - 那就是，创造性干预正变得越来越微不可察。在古代的世界观中，创造者被认为必须亲手塑造宇宙中的每一个细微元素，并持续维护其运转 - 可以说工作繁重且全面。而到了牛顿的科学范式中，创造者只需要设定基本的物理法则 - 一旦这些法则建立，整个宇宙机制便可以自行运转。由此自然引发了一个深刻的哲学思考：是否存在一种如此高效的创造模式，以至于最终我们可能根本不需要一个外在的创造者？

在数学领域，存在一个与我们论证相似的迷人概念，本质上是一种「凭空创造」的思维尝试。在 1920 年代，数学家冯·诺伊曼提出了一种令人惊叹的方法：如何从空集中构建自然数。

他的想法是这样的：集合是事物的汇集（就像宇宙本身），而空集则是不包含任何事物的集合 —— 可以将其视为「零信息」。冯·诺伊曼大胆地提出，通过人类思维的抽象运算，可以从这个最基础的空集出发，逐步建构出所有的数字系统。

虽然这个概念乍听起来有些怪异，但其中蕴含着令人惊叹的逻辑。让我们来看看数学家是如何从「无」中构建「有」的。

想象一个空集，这个空集本身可以再包含另一个空集。当我们创建一个包含空集的集合时，奇妙的事情发生了：这实际上产生了数字「1」。为什么？因为这个集合尽管看起来是空的，但它包含了一个元素 —— 那个空集。

继续这个逻辑，如果空集内部的空集再包含自己的空集，我们就得到了数字「2」。这看起来可能有点绕，但本质上是通过嵌套的空集来表示数字。

就这样，mathematicians（数学家们）可以从最基本的「无」出发，逐步构建出全部自然数。这种从零开始、通过逻辑嵌套生成信息的方法，展示了数学思维的奇妙之处。冯·诺依曼的这种构建数字的方法，生动地诠释了如何从看似完全没有信息的起点，最终创造出丰富而无穷的数学世界。

在冯·诺伊曼富有洞察力的思想中，每一个新的概念都源于先前的创造，形成了一个相互关联、紧密连接的链条。每当我们用不同的视角审视空集时，就会孕育出新的数学概念。这种相互关联性不仅是理解冯·诺伊曼逻辑的关键，也深深植根于现实世界。

想象一下，万物的本质并非独立存在，而是通过彼此间共享的信息来定义。就像一张复杂的网络，物理世界中的每一个对象都通过微妙的信息联系交织在一起。物理对象的所有特性，甚至包括它们的存在本身，都只能通过它们之间的关系和共享的信息来理解。

这种看似抽象的观点实际上反映了一种被称为「关系主义」的哲学思想。它挑战了我们将事物视为孤立个体的传统认知，转而强调万物之间的互动和联系的重要性。

东方宗教和哲学深深植根于关系性思维。在佛教中，特别是存在一个颇为有趣的概念 ——"空性」，这个概念与数学家冯·诺依曼的空集理念惊人地相似。在佛教哲学中，"空性」意味着事物并非独立存在，而是通过与其他事物的互动和关联而呈现。

打个比方，我们来思考一把椅子：它究竟是什么？在哲学中，有一个专门的研究分支叫本体论，专注于追问「存在的本质是什么」这类根本性问题。在此，我恳请本体论研究者们原谅我接下来将用最通俗的语言阐述这些深奥的概念。

试想一把椅子，它看似只是由扶手、座位等零部件组成。但仔细想来，这些所谓的「部件」其实都只是我们赋予的标签。没有「椅子」这个整体概念，扶手本身就无法独立存在。同样的，如果没有「手臂」的概念，"扶手」这个词也将毫无意义。

在追寻椅子的本质时，我们是否可以简单地将椅子定义为呈特定形状的原子集合？然而，深入思考会发现，一个原子本身也只是一个标签，代表了一个包含正电、负电和中性粒子的系统。这些粒子都是我们人为命名的，如电子、质子和中子。

当我们被问及「电子是什么」时，通常会回答：它是一个微小的带负电粒子。但实际上，这个描述不过是一个大标签，它只告诉我们这个粒子在各种实验中的行为特征 -- 比如它会排斥某些粒子，吸引另一些粒子。

如果没有这些简洁的标签，我们将不得不使用冗长的描述：那个在某种条件下会有某种反应，在另一种环境中又表现出不同特性的粒子。由此可见，标签为我们理解和交流提供了极大的便利。

然而，佛教哲学提醒我们：不要将标签误认为就是事物的本质。更深层的智慧在于：仅仅因为我们能够为某个事物命名，并不意味着我们真正理解了它的本质存在。

量子物理学与佛教的空性概念惊人地相似。著名英国天文学家阿瑟·爱丁顿曾深刻阐述过这一观点："' 粒子 ' 这个术语在现代物理学中依然存在，但其原始的经典含义已经荡然无存。如今，粒子可以被最恰当地定义为一组物理特征的概念载体...... 它同时也被视为由这组特征所定义的量子状态的载体...... 人们可能会试图将 ' 数学模型 ' 与' 物理实体 ' 区分开来；但在逻辑上，这种区分几乎是不可能的。发现一个粒子，实际上就是观察到被公认为其存在的某些物理现象。"

爱丁顿实际上在阐明：粒子本质上只是我们用来描述和理解测量结果的概念性标签。整个世界的本质可以归结为测量、观察和彼此关联。我们感知到的复杂性 — 尤其是在生命系统中 — 源于事物之间日益增长的相互联系和交互。

我们能否通过这种方式探究人类如何理解和构建现实？然而，我们注定无法触及事物的本质真相。事实上，万物的存在都源于人类的约定和命名，因此彼此相互依存。佛教哲学认为，追求「空性」的最高境界，实际上是认识到世间万物的深层关联性。类似的思想在其他东方宗教中也普遍存在。

在西方较少人知晓的是印度哲学中的不二论（Advaita Vedanta），它强调宇宙的根本统一性。在这一视角下，我们感知到的独立个体其实只是一种幻象 - 玛雅（Maya）。甚至整个宇宙的存在，也仅仅依赖于我们的命名和认知，而非独立存在。从根本上说，我们的现实就是人类迄今所积累的所有观察和认知的总和！

我们已经来到了一个独特的科学认知时代：宇宙中的每一个微小粒子 — 无论是原子还是光子 — 都被定义为通过特定的探测方法而存在。就像盖革计数器发出的清脆响声标志着某个粒子的出现，探测器的每一次「点击」，实际上都在创造和构建我们对现实的理解。更为深刻的是，在这个过程中，粒子本身并不是独立存在的，而是在被观测的瞬间才真正「存在」。

在盖革计数器等探测器中，什么构成了一次「信号响应」？信号响应是指能够探测粒子存在的实验程序的确定性结果。这是通过在实验装置与目标粒子可能存在的空间区域之间精心设计的相互作用机制来实现的。并非所有相互作用都能提供有效的信息 - 某些相互作用无法准确捕捉粒子的存在。

以光子探测为例，分束器本身并不能提供光子存在的证据。分束器中没有任何机制能记录通过的光子信息。换言之，分束器不会产生探测信号。要获得有效的信号，我们需要使用光电倍增管等专门的探测设备。光电倍增管的工作原理是：当光子与其接触时，会激发出一个电子，这个电子的移动会触发并放大电流，最终被放大到可以被人类感官察觉的宏观尺度，产生可听见的「嘀嗒」声或其他可感知的信号。

我们可以更深入地探讨这个问题。我们可以追问：是否是粒子导致了探测器的触发？答案是否定的。这是因为在量子物理学中，粒子呈现出一种奇特的存在状态 —— 同时存在与不存在。这里我并不仅仅指粒子存在于不同位置，而是指在同一个地方，一个粒子可以同时存在和不存在。这正是量子不确定性的直接体现。

以之前讨论的分束器实验为例，这意味着一个光子同时「进入」和「不进入」分束器。只有当光子处于「存在」状态时，才会在输出端被探测到。探测器是否触发是一个本质上的随机事件，无法通过任何已知方法预测，就像我们无法预测光子在分束器上的反射路径一样。

这进一步说明，我们不能简单地认为「存在的粒子」引发了探测，正如我们不能声称光子的反射导致了探测（因为我们知道它同时也可能穿过）。严格来说，这个「点击」事件本身是没有确定性原因的，这也意味着我们无法追溯到潜在的粒子本身。

在物理世界中，并不存在独立存在的基本粒子。粒子的存在依赖于我们用于探测和观测的复杂方法。每一次探测都是本质上随机的，而现实则呈现为这些随机事件之间的关联 —— 这些关联以物理定律的形式表现出来。这些事件本质上是信息的载体。如果 Kolmogorov 和 Chaitin 关于信息压缩与随机性之间关系的理论成立，那么不论未来我们发现什么样的自然基本理论，这一认知都将保持有效。

我们的现实世界是由量子事件构成的，每一个事件都源于一次看似随机的量子跃迁。这种看似毫无原因的量子变化具有一个独特的特性：它在时间流逝中制造了一个不连续的断点。当一个事件被观测和记录时，它就永远地被定格在宇宙的历史中，成为不可改变的过去。而在事件发生之前，我们对其发生的时间和可能性充满不确定性。在这一刻，所有潜在的可能性同时存在，就像一盘未开始的棋局，一切都充满可能性。当事件最终发生时，它就进入了我们称之为「未来」的领域。

正是这种量子世界的根本随机性，创造了过去与未来的本质差异：过去是已经凝固、静止的，而未来则是流动、充满可能性的。这种看似矛盾的特性，恰恰构成了我们对现实世界最深层的理解。

过去和未来的界限，由测量产生的不连续性，总是相对于进行测量的观察者。根据当前量子力学的理解，如果有人能够控制观察者及其与环境的互动，就可能逆转探测过程，从而抹去观察者原本记录的信息。这并非矛盾，而是局部信息（观察者的视角）与全局信息（操控观察者的人）之间的复杂相互作用。

值得注意的是，这个过程令人惊叹：上述关于认知「空性」的思考，与冯·诺伊曼从空集构建数学体系的方法极其相似，只是方向完全相反。冯·诺伊曼从一个空集出发，推导出实数的无限集；而我们则从宏观物体开始，通过解构发现它们本质上并无实体，仅仅建立在随机性和缺乏先验信息的基础之上。

这是认知的深层逻辑！宇宙中的任何存在，只有通过与其他对象之间的互信息（Mutual Information）才能获得现实性。在这之下，并无绝对的本质存在，也不存在无限追溯的根源。这种机制是必然的，因为我们不可能要求一个有限的宇宙承载无限的信息 - 这在逻辑上是不可能的！

从更深层的认知角度看，宇宙的演化可以理解为：从所有潜在的可能性中，单一的现实逐渐呈现。在这个包含所有未来可能性的初始状态中，第一个事件无中生有地发生（本质上是一个随机事件），由此产生了最初的信息单元。从原本无限的可能性中，随着这个首发事件以特定方式展开，未来的可能性开始收缩和聚焦。每一个后续事件都将以这个初始事件为参照系，在这个过程中，信息位之间通过互相关联和约束，逐步构建起复杂的信息网络。

让我们用雕塑来解释这个有趣的概念。想象一位雕塑家手中有一块原始的大理石。这块未经雕琢的石头，理论上蕴含着无数可能的艺术作品。这个过程很像宇宙的初始状态：所有可能的现实同时存在，但尚未成形。

当雕塑家第一次举起凿子，在石块上轻轻敲击时，一个关键的转变就此发生。这看似简单的一击，实际上改变了石块的全部可能性。就像 breaking 对称性一样，这一刀立即缩减了原本无限的可能性。某些原本可以雕琢的艺术形态，因为这一刀的存在，now 永远无法实现了。

想象米开朗基罗站在一块六米高的巨大石块前，即将雕刻传世名作大卫像。如今，这尊高五米的雕像巍然矗立在佛罗伦萨学院美术馆，见证了文艺复兴大师的非凡才华。

艺术创作犹如精密的削减过程 — 每一刀都将决定最终作品的命运。假如大师一不小心，斜着削掉一块，原本完整的石块顿时分成两块，每块高三米。这时，他仍可以雕刻雕像，但注定无法复制原本完美的大卫。

每一次误操作都会极大地收窄艺术可能性。正如米开朗基罗手中的凿子，每一个轻微的偏差都将重塑艺术的最终形态，将原本无限的可能性逐步收缩。

想象我们正在创作一件艺术品，每一个细微的调整都会缩小未来的可能性。就像雕塑家用刀一点点雕琢作品，每一刀都在塑造最终的形态。当作品完成时，原本无限的可能性被凝固成一个具体的形状。但这并不意味着创作的终点，因为艺术家总是可以继续雕琢、调整。

这个过程带给我们一个有趣的思考：什么时候才算真正完成？事实上，在宇宙的尺度上，"完成」本身就是一个流动的概念。每一次视角的变化都可能带来新的灵感，引发对现实形态的重新思考。即便看似已经无法再做改变，创作者依然可以找到更精细、更微妙的调整方式。

就像一件不断演进的艺术品，现实本身也在不断被重新定义和塑造。

这种思考宇宙的方式完全契合科学探索的精神。科学家们通过观察不同的事物和现象来收集宇宙信息，这些观察进而塑造了我们对现实的理解。在这个过程中，现实以清晰、具体的方式逐渐呈现在我们眼前。

然而，由于我们对宇宙的认知是通过观察者的视角定义的，这就引发了一个关键问题：我们该如何定义这个观察者？是否存在一个绝对可靠的「通用观察者"？除了求助于超自然力量（这常被视为一种逃避），每个观察者本质上都同样有权定义属于自己的现实世界。

在第 2 章中，我们借助卡尔维诺富有创意的「观察者纸牌游戏」来探索现实的本质。在这个独特的游戏中，每个玩家扮演一个观察者，而每个观察者则代表现实世界的一个不同维度 — 经济、物理、生物、社会、计算机科学和哲学。每位观察者就像讲述自己的故事，用手中的纸牌展现独特的视角。

例如，物理学观察者会通过自然定律讲述世界的运行机制 — 苹果落地时的引力作用，水在特定温度下蒸发的物理变化。同样，经济学家会描绘市场的运作，生物学家展现生命的奥秘，而其他学科的观察者也都会用各自的「语言」诠释现实的不同侧面。这些看似独立的视角，实际上共同构成了我们对世界的全方位理解。

桌子旁的每个观察者不仅要讲述自己的故事，还要仔细聆听其他人的叙述。通过这种信息交互和碰撞，我们对现实的理解会逐渐清晰和完整。打个比方，目前物理学已经揭示的「证据卡牌」表明光速是宇宙中最快的旅行速度。但这并不意味着未来的物理学发现不会推翻这一认知 - 届时我们或许会发现在特定条件下可以突破光速。

只要每个「玩家」（科学研究者）在描述时保持逻辑一致，我们对世界的认知就会随着观察时间的延长而不断接近真相。这就像是在倾听一个复杂的故事：如果只听一半，你不仅会错过关键信息，甚至可能完全误解事件的本质。

遗憾的是，要等到我们完全理解宇宙的「游戏规则」，可能需要等待与宇宙年龄相当的漫长时间。因此，科学家们只能不断地、谨慎地推测和逼近真相，在有限的认知中勾勒出我们所理解的现实。

在这个游戏中，每位玩家都通过卡牌来讲述自己的故事。这些卡牌就像一种特殊的语言，事先被赋予了特定的意义，让玩家能够借助它们交流。那么，这些卡牌究竟是从何而来呢？

让我们回顾一下之前的讨论。尽管信息看似以离散的形式存在 - 就像卡牌或数据片段 - 但它们实际上深深植根于基本的随机性之中。想象一下，如果卡牌本身具有某种不确定性，比如同一张卡牌有时代表「力量」，有时又象征「和平」，那么玩家怎么可能用这样的卡牌讲述一个连贯的故事呢？

这看起来似乎是不可能的 - 使用没有明确定义的工具来表达意义，听起来简直荒谬！然而，这恰恰反映了量子物理学的一个深刻洞见：我们感知中看似清晰、稳定的现实，实际上可能只是一种暂时的、依赖观察者的假象。就像这些充满不确定性的卡牌一样，宇宙本身可能也是开放和流动的，只有当我们观测时，它才会呈现出特定的样貌。

举例来说，当一个光的粒子 - 光子 - 遇到像家里卧室窗户这样的玻璃时，可能会发生两种截然不同的结果。一种是光子被反射回来，另一种是光子穿过窗户。量子物理的奇妙之处在于，如果我们试图观测这个光子，我们将永远无法提前预测它的最终走向，这个过程是完全随机的。

更有趣的是，在没有观测的情况下，量子物理给我们讲述了一个令人难以置信的故事：光子似乎同时存在于两种状态 - 它既穿过了玻璃，又被反射了，就仿佛同时存在于两个不同的现实中！

但我们日常生活中只能看到单一的现实：没有人会同时出现在两个地方。那么，观测行为究竟是如何让一种确定的现实从众多可能性中浮现出来的呢？量子物理给出了一个令人着迷的解释：现实仿佛是通过观测者和被观测事物之间的微妙互动而「诞生」的。这就像是一位高明魔术师的神奇把戏 - 他能从一堆看似普通的扑克牌中变出原本不存在的那张特定卡牌。为了更清晰地阐明这个奇妙的概念，且听我用一个简单的游戏来娓娓道来。

在这个有趣的纸牌交换游戏中，四名玩家各自开局被发放四张牌。游戏的核心目标是通过与其他玩家交换牌，最快集齐四张相同的牌（比如四个 A 或四个 10）。

游戏有一个有趣的基本规则：只有当你已经持有至少一张目标牌时，才能向其他玩家询问该类型的牌。例如，只有在你已经拥有至少一张 A 的情况下，才能向其他玩家索要 A。

当你询问某张牌时，如果被询问的玩家没有这张牌，游戏就会轮到下一位玩家。但如果对方确实拥有该牌，他们必须将其交给你，此时你可以选择继续向同一位玩家询问，或者转向其他玩家。

值得注意的是，每次你询问特定类型的牌时，所有其他玩家都会立即知道你手中已经有至少一张这种牌。这意味着下一位玩家可以据此调整自己的策略。

这是一个设计巧妙 yet 简单的游戏，通常只需几轮就能决出胜负，充满了策略和运气的平衡。

有趣的是，这个游戏完全可以不用实体卡牌，就在玩家的想象中进行。每个玩家可以在脑海中构想四张完全任意的卡牌 — 这种玩法打破了传统规则，因为对卡牌上的图像种类和数量没有任何限制。比如，一位玩家可能想象出三张大象卡和一张鳄鱼卡，而另一位玩家则可能想象两张 A 卡和两张苹果卡。

游戏的关键在于，只要玩家遵守一个基本原则 — 不能一开始就拥有四张完全相同的卡牌，那么游戏就必然会推动玩家至少询问一个问题。尽管看似存在无数种组合，但这反而不是问题，因为游戏的机制总能找出最终赢家。

游戏的精妙之处在于，玩家不能随意改变已经发生的游戏过程，但可以在游戏中灵活调整自己的卡牌。例如，当你向其他玩家询问某种卡牌时，你自己必须至少拥有该类型的卡牌；同样地，当有人询问特定卡牌时，被询问者必须交出这张卡牌。这种严格的一致性规则和动态调整卡牌的策略，会迅速缩小游戏可能性的范围。

无论是回答还是询问问题，都会实时影响所有玩家手中的卡牌。就这样，这个完全依靠想象的无限制版本，最终会收敛到一个有明确规则的游戏，并产生一个确定的赢家。

这种不断质疑的过程，就像物理学实验中探索未知的方法：我们起初面对无限可能性，但通过与系统互动，并根据获得的信息调整实验方法，我们逐步缩小可能性的范围，最终锁定一个确定的结果 —— 单一的现实。就像实验必须遵循物理定律一样，这些探索也需要遵守游戏规则。现实就这样通过实验被创造出来，犹如在这个想象中的纸牌游戏里纸牌被赋予生命。通过这个类比，我希望读者能感受到量子力学世界的奇妙与不可思议。

宇宙中的信息，正如卡尔维诺所设想的那样，具有三个关键特征：它是离散的（正如我们在讨论 DNA 和生命时已经阐明的），它随上下文动态变化，并且是有限的。但卡尔维诺纸牌游戏中存在一个关键的不同：现实世界中根本没有现成的纸牌。自然不会提前为我们准备好起始牌面 —— 这正是量子物理学中著名的「隐变量排除」定理。我们只能通过不断观察和探索，逐步揭示和创造这些「纸牌」。

宇宙中的信息犹如一场特殊的纸牌游戏，类似 Calvino 所描绘的游戏场景。设想每个玩家手中有一套独特的纸牌，这些纸牌本身并无预设的含义。就像雕塑家面对一块原始的石块，可以雕琢出任何想象中的形态，我们同样拥有创造现实的无限可能性。在游戏伊始，所有潜在的现实都处于开放状态，等待被赋予意义和形态。

当你通过询问他人来收集信息时，你的人生故事会以一种难以预测的方式展开，这种方式完全取决于其他人所分享的信息。这个过程仅仅受制于先前叙述的一致性。打个比方，假如物理学告诉我们一个苹果被丢下并落地，那么它之后就不能声称苹果并未落地 - 这个事件已经被定义、交流并记录，因此不可更改。如果我们后来发现在某些特殊情况下苹果可能不会落地，这并不会与之前的陈述相矛盾，而是增添了一个新的认知 - 即在特定条件下，事物的表现可能会有所不同。

这个「无牌纸牌游戏」的独特之处，正在于纸牌仿佛凭空诞生。一开始，我们处于一个完全开放的状态 —— 所有可能性都存在，就像站在一个无限可能的起点。无论是纸牌的排列还是标记，都没有任何限制。随着我们开始提问，一个清晰的秩序逐渐显现。这些受严格规则约束的问题，会揭示出一种原本不存在的现实。这与传统纸牌游戏中发牌时牌面就已确定的情况截然不同 —— 在这个游戏中，一切都在互动中生成。

在探讨无中生有的奇妙概念时，英国化学家 Peter Atkins 提供了一个令人深思的解释：' 最初，什么都不存在。这是一种绝对的虚无，甚至不是简单的空白空间。那时既没有空间，也没有时间，因为时间本身尚未诞生。宇宙是混沌而虚无的。偶然间，一个微小的波动发生了，一组点从虚无中浮现，通过彼此间的关系和模式赋予了自身存在，从而奠定了时间的基础。' 随后，空间（乃至一切事物）以类似的方式逐渐形成。这种描述看似优雅，却面临一个关键挑战：在没有任何预设理论的情况下，很难准确量化最初引发一切的那个微小波动。要确定波动的大小和概率，我们通常需要更多基础性知识，比如量子理论 —— 这可以被视为理解宇宙「游戏规则」的基本框架。

就像我们需要物理定律来描述世界的运行一样，事件的发生同样依赖于这些定律。这引发了一个有趣的哲学问题：究竟是物理定律先存在，还是事件的发生促成了这些定律的形成？如果我们假设物理定律是首要的，并且它们决定了事件的发展，这种观点真的站得住脚吗？

实际上，物理定律之所以成为「定律」，正是因为存在大量一致性的事件，这些事件反复遵循特定的模式。可以说，事件本身就是定律的载体和基础。如果要声称物理定律最初就存在，那么这意味着在这些定律生效之前，不可能有任何事件发生。这是否意味着这些「定律」本身就存疑？

更有趣的是，有证据表明，即使没有预先设定的整体规则，信息和事件也可以自发地产生和演化。这提示我们，世界的运作可能比我们想象的更加复杂和动态。

莱布尼茨提出了一个有趣的哲学观点：宇宙最简单的状态应该是虚无，而我们所看到的世界恰恰相反 - 充满了丰富的存在。对他来说，这种令人惊讶的「存在」本身，就是上帝存在的最佳证明。

从信息论的角度来看，这个观点同样引人深思。如果宇宙初始状态是「一无所有」，在信息论中就意味着系统的信息熵（可以理解为系统的混乱程度和不确定性）为零。随后，系统中出现的任何信息变化，并不必然意味着需要一个外部的、超自然的创造者。因为信息可以在局部系统中自发地产生和 reorganize，即便从整体上看，信息总量保持不变。

我们可以通过两个密切关联的知识路径来理解和构建我们的现实世界。在宇宙的演变过程中，事件会自发地产生信息关联（即互信息 mutual information），这种关联没有任何预先的决定性因素。这种自发的信息关联激活了知识形成的两个基本路径。

一方面，通过我们不断的观察、推测和验证，我们将复杂的宇宙信息归纳总结成一系列基本的自然法则。这些法则本质上是用最简洁的方式来描述和解释我们的观察结果。

另一方面，我们通过运行这些法则，构建起我们对现实的整体理解。而这种理解反过来又会指引和限定我们对可能性的认知，告诉我们什么是可行的，什么是不可能的，换句话说，揭示了我们认知和行动的边界。

宇宙起初是空白的，但已蕴含着巨大的潜在信息。决定宇宙发展方向的关键事件是第一次「对称性破缺（symmetry breaking)」，犹如宇宙演化的首次结构性选择。这一看似完全随机、没有任何先验原因的事件，仅仅通过决定宇宙中某个微小维度的特定状态，就开启了宇宙演化的复杂链式反应。一旦某个基本规则被确立，宇宙的其余部分就必须遵循这一规则，保持内在的逻辑一致性。正如作家伊塔洛·卡尔维诺（Italo Calvino）在其作品中描述的叙事游戏，宇宙的每一个后续「篇章」都必须与之前的部分保持连贯和一致。

这是知识探索的起点。我们将宇宙中自发且相互关联的信息，通过不断检验和淘汰错误理论的方式，逐步压缩和提炼成一套持续演进的自然法则。正如生物通过对环境变化的不断适应而进化，人类对宇宙（我们的现实）的理解也在不断发展。我们通过更精确地综合和提炼所观察到的信息，逐步构建更准确的自然规律。这就是自然法则产生的过程，也是构建我们知识体系的基础 —— 包括物理、生物和社会层面的基本原理。

知识探索的第二个维度是对第一个维度的辩证补充。当我们揭示自然法则后，就开始探究这些法则的深层含义，以构建和界定我们的认知世界，厘清其中的可能与不可能。这是一个本质性的真理：我们的世界观完全建立在对这些基本法则的理解之上。比如，在不了解自然选择理论之前，所有生物 species 似乎是相互独立、毫无关联地被创造出来的。

这一认知过程是动态且不断发展的。当我们遇到无法用现有理论解释的事件时，就会重新审视和调整我们的法则，使我们的世界模型能够容纳和解释这些新的发现。

这种知识探索的基础，可以形象地比喻为认知的「虚无」或「黑暗"—— 一个充满未知的领域，我们的理解正是从这里生发并不断演化。沿着认知之路，我们最终意识到：没有绝对的法则，也就没有绝对的现实。正是第二个维度的探索，帮助我们从这个认知的虚无中浮现，逐渐勾勒出一个相互关联、富有内在逻辑的世界图景。

我们的两个知识之箭似乎指向相反的方向。第一个箭头将繁杂的信息压缩成简明的知识，第二个箭头则将这些抽象的规律展开，描绘出丰富多彩的现实图景。从这个意义上说，我们的整个现实都被编码在自然法则之中。

我们知道，宇宙中的信息有一个特定的流动方向：熵（混乱度）只会增加，不会减少。这就赋予了宇宙一个明确的时间方向，这也是我们所说的「时间之箭」。那么，这两个知识之箭又如何与时间之箭产生关联呢？

第一个知识之箭就像是一个信息整理专家。它不断与时间之箭对抗，孜孜不倦地将杂乱无章的信息压缩成更有意义的知识。它将看似毫无联系的事件串联起来，揭示它们之间深层的因果关联。与之相反，第二个知识之箭则通过重新解读现实，为我们打开新的可能性之门。它告诉我们，当我们改变对现实的理解时，原本被限制的行动空间也会随之拓展。

在我们的内心深处，在宇宙的每一个角落，似乎都存在着两种相互对立的力量：创造新信息的混沌趋势，以及我们试图将这些混沌归纳为简单规则的理性追求。这是一场永无止境的较量：宇宙不断产生新的、复杂的信息，而我们则孜孜不倦地寻求理解和秩序。我们能否在这场看似不对称的较量中占据上风？

### Key points

Scientific knowledge proceeds via a dialogue with Nature. We ask ‘yes-no' questions through our observations of various phenomena.

Information in this way is created out of no information. By taking a stab in the dark we set a marker which we can then use to refine our understanding by asking such ‘yes-no' questions.

This inductive method, which is the basis of constructing physical theories, I called the darkness of physics. Stating that something is not is the key to building better and better models of the world. Physical laws are usually more fundamental the more they rule out: ‘no such process exists, where so and so would happen' is a typical way of formulating it.

There are many parallels in religion which use the Nagative Way to reach the ultimate truth. Two prominent examples are the Cappadocian Fathers in early Christianity and Advaita Vedanta in Hinduism.

The whole of our reality emerges by first using the conjectures and refutations to compress observations and then from this compression we deduce what is and isn't possible.

关键要点：

科学探索本质上是一种与自然对话的过程。科学家们就像侦探，通过一系列精心设计的「是或否」的观察和实验，逐步揭开自然的奥秘。

信息的诞生往往源于未知。就像在黑暗中摸索的探险家，科学家们勇敢地提出假设，设立初步的「标记」。随后，他们通过提出连续的、越来越精确的问题，逐步完善对世界的理解。

这种自下而上的归纳方法，是构建物理理论的基础。我将其比喻为「物理学的黑暗」：真正深刻的科学认知，常常不是通过肯定某些事情存在，而是通过排除不可能的情况来实现。最基本的物理定律，往往是那些能够最有力地说明「某些过程不可能发生」的理论。

在宗教探索终极真理的过程中，存在许多运用「否定神学」的方法。两个著名的例子是早期基督教的卡帕多西亚教父（4 世纪神学家群体）和印度教的不二论（Advaita Vedanta）。

我们对现实的理解，实际上是通过一个不断提出假设、检验和否定的过程。我们首先对观察到的现象进行压缩和提炼，通过这种方式来推断什么是可能存在的，什么是不可能存在的。
