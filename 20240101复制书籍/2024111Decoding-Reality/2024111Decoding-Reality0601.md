0601Place Your Bets: In It to Win It

Until now we have discussed how life propagates and how life eventually ends; but I guess what most of us are preoccupied with is ‘what we do in between.' In this chapter, I would like to stay in-between these two extremes and enjoy the moment. What more could we ask for? Excitement is what I, for one, would like to have.

Whilst the concept of excitement may be subjective, most would agree that some modicum of risk comes as a given. It is much harder to get excited by certainty (let's face it, we all find certainty boring). Let us instead choose life and discuss the various ways to make it more exciting.

It's 1962 Las Vegas, the city of dreams. Millions are made and lost every minute of every day. The city is littered with dreams of rookies making their way across the Nevada desert with borrowed money to chance their arm. Perhaps he will come back a millionaire or perhaps he will come back with his tail between his legs. But this day is different. Today a new cowboy is in town. He enters one of the casinos, the music is going, the cameras are on him, and the wine and the girls are on tap. He looks around, spots the blackjack table and makes a beeline straight for it. When the sexiest game in town is poker – why is this guy spending all his time on the blackjack table? He has a strategy, he thinks, that will beat the dealer. In his pocket, he has $10,000 to play with (in 1962 not an insignificant amount – worth around a cool quarter of a million dollars today), so this guy clearly means business.

He starts to play the game like any rookie, placing small bets, quite innocuous, but as the game wears on, whilst others were leaving the table, this guy is still going. Slowly but surely his strategy seemed to be working. Of course, no casino likes winners, and is particularly wary of those that go about their business with such ruthless efficiency in such a cool and methodical manner. While casino security were keeping a close eye on him, they just couldn't see where the angle was; why was this guy consistently winning? Why couldn't he just be like everyone else and lose? So they let him play for another couple of hours, before they decided that enough was enough and escorted him out of the building. It's an interesting fact that any casino can kick you out just because you are starting to win more than their statistical expectation (which is that on the whole you should be losing!). Over the weekend this guy played virtually every casino in Las Vegas, and by the end had been expelled from them all. In total he walked away from Vegas with a cool $21,000 in winnings (more than doubling his initial investment).

His name was Edward Thorp and, as it turn out, he was a professor of Mathematics at MIT. He later wrote a book on his experiences and betting strategies, Beat the Dealer, which subsequently became a best seller, selling over 700,000 copies. So what was his strategy? (And by the way, who the hell lends a quarter million dollars to a university professor to gamble with anyway?)

Edward Thorp was also excited by taking risks. However he knew that if he played in a certain way his risk taking was limited, and that he would be able to get a good return in the long term. So what exactly is the right amount of risk taking? This amount, too – believe it or not – is governed by Shannon's laws of information, providing that you're in it to win it.

Edward Thorp was familiar with the research of Shannon and J. L. Kelly, a colleague of Shannon's at Bell Labs. Kelly's paper came some 10 years after Shannon's and was the first to apply Shannon's ideas to betting. This was the first piece of work extending Shannon's information theory. It is rather surprising that in 10 years there was no other extension. The reason for this was apparently not that it took a long time to accept Shannon. On the contrary, his paper was an overnight success. The point was, instead, that Shannon's results were so complete and perfectly argued that no-one had anything to add to it! So, what did Kelly manage to do?

Remember that the information gain is very large when something unlikely happens and this is what leads to the greatest surprise and (possibly) excitement. Well, the best way to get excited is to enter a casino and place a bet on an unlikely thing, like throwing snake eyes (that is, two dice each coming up with a number one in a single throw). This has a 1 in 36 chance of happening (because there are six numbers on each die and six times six is 36). This event is unlikely and it is precisely because of it that you would be awarded a large sum of cash if you win. Betting on an even number would not be as rewarding since you would have a 50/50 chance. If the casino is fair (and none of them are, given how Thorp was kicked out of Las Vegas), then if you put down a dollar on snake eyes and you won, you should receive $36 back in return. Quite a nice return, you will agree!

Of course, you do not have to bet in a casino. You could invest your money into companies. The smaller, less known, and less likely a company is to succeed (given prevailing market conditions and business strategy), the more money you will get in return if it does succeed (for a fixed investment). This ‘smells' very much like what we said of information: the smaller the probability of an event, the larger its information gain and in this case the larger the information the larger the payoff should be. Shannon's information principles are therefore, indeed, also at work in the business world. And betting on the success of companies is fairer than any casino (assuming efficient markets of course).

We all like to win. No one likes to be a loser. So can information theory guide us and maximize our chances of success? Astonishing though it may seem, the answer is a definitive ‘yes'. Maximizing profit in financial speculations is exactly the same problem as maximizing the channel capacity for communication. The latter we know was already solved by Shannon in Chapter 3. So this is just a case of applying the solution to other problems. The solution was that the maximum capacity of a channel is achieved if the lengths of messages follow the ‘log of the inverse probability' rule of Shannon's. If you now think of the amount of money that you are receiving on successful investments as the length of your message, than you obtain something that the (remaining) City of London and Wall Street traders refer to as ‘the log optimal portfolio'.

Here is how this betting with the log optimal portfolio works in practice. The basic logic is to spread your bets as best as possible, i.e. don't place all your eggs in the same basket. The reason for this is that you would like to keep betting (and hopefully winning) for a long time. If all your bets are in one place, and you lose at the beginning (you might just be very unlucky) then you no longer have any credit to make the next bet. Just as in communicating, some of the bets will involve a large sum of money; some, on the other hand, will need to be very small. But how exactly should we determine the size of our investment?

Let's imagine that you like to play it safe and play for a long time – like a real connoisseur of gambling. You'd like to invest for 20 years, and whilst you are not looking for any huge return per year, you do want your money to add up nicely in the long term (so that you can enjoy your older age, as with pension funds). Here is what information theory tells us to do (in reality you will, most likely, get a financial advisor who will do all the thinking, calculating, and investing for you, but I would like to show you what kind of calculations they do. And remember, they also take a percentage – if you do it yourself you could be better off in the final analysis).

Let's take the top-10 FTSE (this is the London Financial Times Stock Exchange) companies at present. They are more likely to remain in the top-100 for quite some time and not to go under any time soon. Say you have a lump sum of $1000 that you would want to invest across these 10 companies. You first want to estimate the probabilities that these companies will make a positive return to you (i.e. you will win by investing in them). To estimate these probabilities (no one gives them to you) you can look at the past performance of the companies as well as current market conditions and strategies. The better your understanding of all the public information available about this company the more accurately you'll be able to estimate your probabilities and hence hope to derive an optimal betting strategy. This is the full-time job of City analysts. This is what they do 80 hours a week, every week (currently it's gone up to 90 hours a week, as a friend of mine reliably tells me). However even with only the basic level of research and approximate probabilities you can still make a good return by spreading your investment according to Shannon.

The share value of a company will sometimes go up and sometimes come down; in other words, there will be some natural fluctuation in the market. Overall, however, if the company is financially and strategically sound, and top-100 FTSE companies tend to be more so, then they will demonstrate an overall upward trend in the long term.

Using all this publically available information, we can estimate the probability that a company will make 3% next year. This is not as difficult as it initially looks (if we just want rough estimates). If it has made more than 3% every year for the past 50 years and analysts expect it to make 10% next year then the probability of it making 3% is fairly high. This way you can estimate the probabilities of certain returns for Company X.

Note that Thorp did not have the problem of estimating probabilities in playing blackjack, as the set of outcomes is well known, and by reading the cards he was able to recalculate probabilities. In fact, this is the exact reason why Thorp chose blackjack over other games such as slot machines (with a slot machine there is no prior information you could use to predict the next outcome). While playing blackjack Thorp was able to estimate future probabilities by seeing what cards had already been presented and adjusting his betting strategy appropriately. Following the performances of companies is like following cards.

In the highly unlikely event of the reader not being familiar with the game of blackjack (in which case I urge you to get out more) I'll give a brief overview. The basic premise of the game is that you want to have a hand value that is closer to 21 points than that of the dealer (without going over 21; if you do, you lose). Each card is worth a certain number of points and the dealer hands them out upon request. Other players at the table are of no concern, other than the fact that you can memorize their cards and adjust your probabilities appropriately. Your hand is strictly played out against the hand of the dealer. To determine whether to ask for another card, Thorp was simply using Shannon's formula into which he inserted the estimated probabilities.

Let's say we are playing against the dealer in a Vegas casino. We have three cards in front of us totaling 15 points and the dealer is asking us whether we want another card. So now we are thinking, what are the chances of the next card being six or less? Intuitively, given that we have already seen four sixes, three fives, three fours, and three twos, and three aces, we already have more information than somebody who wasn't paying any attention. Whereas somebody else may take the risk we know that logically there is a lower chance of seeing a card that will not take us over 21. So Shannon's formula just formalizes this and indicates when it is and isn't a good time to take a risk.

Walking into a casino may be a risky proposition altogether, especially if you are borrowing mafia money to gamble. So, let's think of a more wholesome scenario. After all why worry about casinos when gambling is fully legalized in the great global financial market of ours (I apologise to the reader for the slight cynicism as I sit here in October 2008 watching my pension fund taking a hammering).

We can extrapolate Shannon's formula and use it to invest in the stock market. Let us assume that one company has a 55% chance of a 3% return over a year, another has a 60% chance, and so on. How should we now invest? The best investment intuitively would be to invest proportionally. Namely you should invest most in the company that has highest returning odds, less into the next one, and so on. If one company has a twice higher chance of yielding the same positive return on your capital, then you should invest twice as much into it. And how about the return on your investment – how much would that be? The expected return would amazingly enough be exactly equal to Shannon's information formula! How can this be understood?

I would like to take a concrete example, just to show you how much you can objectively really earn in practice. Suppose that you are only investing into a top company and that it has a 55% chance of winning you money in a day. Say, as before, that you have $1000 to invest. First of all, information theory says that you should not invest more than 2 times 55 minus 100% (2 × 55 - 100) of your money. This comes out to 10%, which is $100. The reason for this is that you need a buffer if you lose money – you would still like to be able to keep playing. It is only if you keep playing that the loot can add up to a substantial amount.

You have now invested $100. Shannon's information theory says that the rate at which your profit will increase is 0.5%. This means that you will have gained 50 cents. Next day, if things have not changed, you will also get 0.5%, but now you have started with $100 and 50 cents – which is more than the first time, being 50 cents and 0.5% of 50 cents, and so on . . . At the beginning you will not notice much change, but the growth is basically exponential (all exponentials are linear to start with which is why they do not look impressive initially). After one year – 365 days – you will end up doubling your money to $200. Next year you would have $400, then eight, and after five years you would have gained 16 times more than you started with. This rate of increase seems much better than the rate of inflation which is eating away at your capital if you are lazy with it and keep it safe in your bank and uninvested.

The earnings in the previous paragraph still may not sound all that much, but remember that you only invested a $100 in the first place. What if you'd invested $100,000? You would still earn 0.5% on top of it, but this would now be $500 (per day!). And all this for doing nothing, ‘just (in this case very slightly) risking' the possibility of losing your money.

Shannon's formula will also tell us that you should not bet on anything that is completely uncertain (so don't play the lottery if you listen to Kelly's advice). If the chances of success are only 50%, then you would be wise to abstain from betting. On average you will gain nothing and in all probability you will lose everything.

Now let's link the discussion of financial markets and monetary speculations to the previous chapter, namely to the concept of Maxwell's demon. Can we use thermodynamics to describe the overall behaviour of markets and to deduce some very general trends in the financial world?

There is an obvious way in which thermodynamics affects markets. The price of something is clearly driven by the supply and demand principle and if the resources are scarce, then the price will be pushed up. As we have seen, thermodynamics implies that our energy resources will be getting depleted as well as causing other unpleasant effects on our planet as they wind down. This is bound to have an effect on the economy in general and we, in fact, see this kind of stuff around us all the time. The price of petrol is linked to oil and this in turn depends on the reserves of oil as well as on its availability. Even the slightest sniff of a conflict in the Middle East pushes up the world petrol prices.

However, thermodynamics and economics are more closely linked than this. The behaviour of financial markets itself, in some sense, quite closely mirrors the behaviour of physical systems in thermodynamics. There is a general law in finance that you hear repeated very frequently: ‘that in an efficient market there is no financial gain without risk'. Anything worth doing must, according to this law, have a (significant) probability of failure associated with it. If something is a sure thing, you can bet that the reward is going to be negligible.

This sounds very much like the statement that in order to produce some useful work, you must be prepared to waste some heat. The Second Law of thermodynamics tells us that you must increase the temperature of your environment in order to do work and this is synonymous with the fact that the house takes more money than is proportionally fair (i.e. on average it always costs you more to win than you earn). Let us go back to the simple game of betting in a casino to illustrate this point further. We would like to argue that money will play the role of energy.

But, wait a minute – you will say, how can that be when money, unlike energy itself, is not quite conserved? Money can be generated out of nowhere while energy, as we have seen, cannot. If we have more people in the world, there will be more money around, so money is obviously not a constant. However, if we assume that we have a person betting against the casino in a house, then the total amount of money is fixed. The money could be in a person's pocket or it could be in the casino's safe, but it has to be somewhere. So, only under these specific conditions, is money conserved and can be compared with energy.

Now we can state the rules of betting in the casino in a way that we recover analogues of the laws of thermodynamics. First of all, the odds given by the house are such that:

1‘You cannot win the game'. This means that if the probability for something is one third, your return will at most be three times your investment. So, if you invest $10 you will get at most $30 back, but with an overwhelming probability – two-thirds (67%) – you will lose. On average as you continue the game, you will not win anything. This is the exact analogue of the First Law of thermodynamics – you cannot get something for nothing.

The Second Law of betting is even more depressing, since casinos are designed in such a way that

2‘You cannot even break even'. This means that you will never get the fair odds, plus in a real casino you will have to pay to enter, you will have to pay to play, you will – most likely – be buying some drinks and tipping the casino personnel as you go along. All this contributes to the fact that while money is overall conserved it has the tendency to move from your pocket into the casino safe and not the other way round. This is the analogue of entropy increase in thermodynamics, where heat always flows from a hot to a cold body and never the other way round. So, in casino betting, the player is ‘hot', while the casino is ‘cool', and this determines the direction of the flow of money.

Now, there is also a Third Law of thermodynamics, which, of course, also has its analogue in betting. It says that:

3 ‘You cannot quit the game'.

I will leave the reader to interpret the meaning of this statement themselves. Suffice it to say that gamblers usually gamble till the bitter end. The laws of betting are just so very similar to the laws of thermodynamics (the Third Law of thermodynamics being the one prohibiting us from reaching absolute zero; in gambling terms this means being cooler than anything else, in particular the casino itself).

All the discussion so far can simply be summarized by saying that Shannon's formula for the maximum channel capacity, Boltzmann's formula for physical entropy, and Kelly's formula for maximizing profit are all one and the same formula.

However, what is really surprising is that betting can be seen as a very fruitful metaphor for the evolution of life itself. We can think of random mutations as producing different gambling strategies, each with a different likelihood of success. This is exactly what a biologist, Frederic Warburton, analysed in one of his papers.

Warburton views evolution as a game between an individual (the gambler) and its environment (the house). Profiting in evolutionary terms means that, regardless of the environment, life will propagate. Losing means that life will end. So the game is as follows: the individual produces copies of itself, but naturally the copy will be slightly different due to random mutations. They may arise from the environment (due to cosmic rays, say) or some error in transcription. These mutations lead to a slightly altered set of properties in the new individuals, which are then tested by Nature and the environment. The number of individuals produced depends very much on the gambling strategy being employed. Any individual produced will have to be fed and nurtured and, given that resources are finite, we must choose how many copies to make in line with these restrictions. The new individuals then either pass the evolution test and further multiply (i.e. they generate profit) or they fail and die (i.e. the investment is lost). In economics, this is known as the principle of increasing returns. It is now clear that those that survive profit more and more in the sense that their strategy mirrors the environment better and better. Thus life increases profitability and evolution becomes a gambling game.

However, as always there is a snag; the more profitable life becomes the less profitable its environment (as it increases proportionally in entropy). As the environment increases in entropy, this makes it more and more difficult for life to propagate. In a similar manner, as you become more profitable in a casino (analogous to the environment) it in turn necessarily affects your profit in the long term through several consequences: it may reduce its payouts, charge a percentage tax on your winnings, or perhaps pack up altogether. Given that there is even a charge for playing the game in the first place, we can see how the second principle of betting manifests itself: namely that you cannot even break even.

We said that we can view life as a Maxwell's demon trying to keep low entropy locally, while increasing the entropy of its environment. In fact, as we saw, the more we keep the local entropy low the more we will keep increasing the total entropy of the system. Can the total entropy increase therefore be an indicator of life? Could we scan other planets for their entropy content to determine whether any life exists on them?

This is a fascinating question and the answer is that the total entropy production, while important, is probably not the only relevant factor. Out of all planets and moons in the Solar System, Mercury has the highest entropy production per unit area, but as far as we know, it has no life. The answer most likely lies in the fact that Mercury has no atmosphere and an atmosphere provides a medium for transport of matter that is crucial for living processes to take place.

The Earth and the Moon share the second place for the highest entropy production, which is roughly a quarter that of Mercury. The Moon again has virtually no atmosphere (it is gravitationally too weak to attract atoms to its surface) and this makes it difficult to have life. The rest of the planets and moons have entropy production far lower (Mars is fourth with two-thirds of the entropy production of the Earth or Moon).

Therefore, the total entropy production is very relevant for life, but it seems to be only a part of the story. However, there are other more dramatic options. It could also be that we have to enlarge our definition of life, and then we will recognize it in other places. Given, however, that it is very difficult to specify all the features of life (are viruses living or not?), entropy production seems to be quite a good single indicator.

Another important feature of life is that it becomes more complex. Let us see if we are able to quantify this trend more precisely, based on the discussion so far. Let us define complexity as the difference between a maximally disordered state, i.e. a maximum entropy, and the actual entropy with respect to the local environment (a thermodynamicist called Peter Landsberg actually proposed this definition). Natural selection favours organisms that minimize entropy with respect to environment (the best gamblers in the language of this chapter). Those that don't, die out. Therefore, mutations will eventually lead to lower local entropy which, given that we subtract from the maximal total entropy to get complexity, results in increased complexity of life. It might be worth noting that it isn't that all life forms become more complex with time – obviously they don't and many are highly successful as they are and have been around for ages (e.g. types of bacteria). But more complex forms appear over time and it is this increase in some forms we are trying to explain.

The increase of complexity of life with time is now seen to be a direct consequence of evolution: random mutations and natural selection. In fact, the famous Oxford biologist Richard Dawkins has argued passionately in a number of his popular accounts that evolution is the only theory we have that can explain all the living complexity we see around us. Given that we stated that life may maximize total entropy production this may imply that it also maximizes complexity increase. Biological complexity is therefore the same as the successful gambler's profit and it grows in the same way.

Through analysis of betting and financial speculation and then synthesis of its fundamental principles, we can see another example of how information seems to be the most natural framework within which to discuss such ideas. We extend this approach again in the next chapter to discuss the social interactions that define how we live and the quality of our lives.

Key points

It is possible to use Shannon's logic to drive betting strategies for maximizing profit.

If you want to win in a casino, you must invest according to the probabilities for various gambling outcomes. Low probability should deserve a correspondingly low investment.

Gambling on a completely random event is really gambling of the lowest order, and in the long run you'll never make a profit (given that half the time you win and half the time you will lose).

If you follow Shannon's logic, your return on an investment will be according to Shannon's entropy. In finance, this way of spreading your bets is known as the log optimal portfolio approach and is widely used as the basis for investment decisions.

Life is also a form of gambling, where life wins by propagating itself. The degree to which it wins is related to the length of time for which it propagates.
