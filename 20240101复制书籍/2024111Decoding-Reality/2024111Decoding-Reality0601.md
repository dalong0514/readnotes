## 0601Place Your Bets: In It to Win It

Until now we have discussed how life propagates and how life eventually ends; but I guess what most of us are preoccupied with is ‘what we do in between.' In this chapter, I would like to stay in-between these two extremes and enjoy the moment. What more could we ask for? Excitement is what I, for one, would like to have.

Whilst the concept of excitement may be subjective, most would agree that some modicum of risk comes as a given. It is much harder to get excited by certainty (let's face it, we all find certainty boring). Let us instead choose life and discuss the various ways to make it more exciting.

It's 1962 Las Vegas, the city of dreams. Millions are made and lost every minute of every day. The city is littered with dreams of rookies making their way across the Nevada desert with borrowed money to chance their arm. Perhaps he will come back a millionaire or perhaps he will come back with his tail between his legs. But this day is different. Today a new cowboy is in town. He enters one of the casinos, the music is going, the cameras are on him, and the wine and the girls are on tap. He looks around, spots the blackjack table and makes a beeline straight for it. When the sexiest game in town is poker – why is this guy spending all his time on the blackjack table? He has a strategy, he thinks, that will beat the dealer. In his pocket, he has $10,000 to play with (in 1962 not an insignificant amount – worth around a cool quarter of a million dollars today), so this guy clearly means business.

He starts to play the game like any rookie, placing small bets, quite innocuous, but as the game wears on, whilst others were leaving the table, this guy is still going. Slowly but surely his strategy seemed to be working. Of course, no casino likes winners, and is particularly wary of those that go about their business with such ruthless efficiency in such a cool and methodical manner. While casino security were keeping a close eye on him, they just couldn't see where the angle was; why was this guy consistently winning? Why couldn't he just be like everyone else and lose? So they let him play for another couple of hours, before they decided that enough was enough and escorted him out of the building. It's an interesting fact that any casino can kick you out just because you are starting to win more than their statistical expectation (which is that on the whole you should be losing!). Over the weekend this guy played virtually every casino in Las Vegas, and by the end had been expelled from them all. In total he walked away from Vegas with a cool $21,000 in winnings (more than doubling his initial investment).

His name was Edward Thorp and, as it turn out, he was a professor of Mathematics at MIT. He later wrote a book on his experiences and betting strategies, Beat the Dealer, which subsequently became a best seller, selling over 700,000 copies. So what was his strategy? (And by the way, who the hell lends a quarter million dollars to a university professor to gamble with anyway?)

Edward Thorp was also excited by taking risks. However he knew that if he played in a certain way his risk taking was limited, and that he would be able to get a good return in the long term. So what exactly is the right amount of risk taking? This amount, too – believe it or not – is governed by Shannon's laws of information, providing that you're in it to win it.

Edward Thorp was familiar with the research of Shannon and J. L. Kelly, a colleague of Shannon's at Bell Labs. Kelly's paper came some 10 years after Shannon's and was the first to apply Shannon's ideas to betting. This was the first piece of work extending Shannon's information theory. It is rather surprising that in 10 years there was no other extension. The reason for this was apparently not that it took a long time to accept Shannon. On the contrary, his paper was an overnight success. The point was, instead, that Shannon's results were so complete and perfectly argued that no-one had anything to add to it! So, what did Kelly manage to do?

Remember that the information gain is very large when something unlikely happens and this is what leads to the greatest surprise and (possibly) excitement. Well, the best way to get excited is to enter a casino and place a bet on an unlikely thing, like throwing snake eyes (that is, two dice each coming up with a number one in a single throw). This has a 1 in 36 chance of happening (because there are six numbers on each die and six times six is 36). This event is unlikely and it is precisely because of it that you would be awarded a large sum of cash if you win. Betting on an even number would not be as rewarding since you would have a 50/50 chance. If the casino is fair (and none of them are, given how Thorp was kicked out of Las Vegas), then if you put down a dollar on snake eyes and you won, you should receive $36 back in return. Quite a nice return, you will agree!

Of course, you do not have to bet in a casino. You could invest your money into companies. The smaller, less known, and less likely a company is to succeed (given prevailing market conditions and business strategy), the more money you will get in return if it does succeed (for a fixed investment). This ‘smells' very much like what we said of information: the smaller the probability of an event, the larger its information gain and in this case the larger the information the larger the payoff should be. Shannon's information principles are therefore, indeed, also at work in the business world. And betting on the success of companies is fairer than any casino (assuming efficient markets of course).

We all like to win. No one likes to be a loser. So can information theory guide us and maximize our chances of success? Astonishing though it may seem, the answer is a definitive ‘yes'. Maximizing profit in financial speculations is exactly the same problem as maximizing the channel capacity for communication. The latter we know was already solved by Shannon in Chapter 3. So this is just a case of applying the solution to other problems. The solution was that the maximum capacity of a channel is achieved if the lengths of messages follow the ‘log of the inverse probability' rule of Shannon's. If you now think of the amount of money that you are receiving on successful investments as the length of your message, than you obtain something that the (remaining) City of London and Wall Street traders refer to as ‘the log optimal portfolio'.

Here is how this betting with the log optimal portfolio works in practice. The basic logic is to spread your bets as best as possible, i.e. don't place all your eggs in the same basket. The reason for this is that you would like to keep betting (and hopefully winning) for a long time. If all your bets are in one place, and you lose at the beginning (you might just be very unlucky) then you no longer have any credit to make the next bet. Just as in communicating, some of the bets will involve a large sum of money; some, on the other hand, will need to be very small. But how exactly should we determine the size of our investment?

Let's imagine that you like to play it safe and play for a long time – like a real connoisseur of gambling. You'd like to invest for 20 years, and whilst you are not looking for any huge return per year, you do want your money to add up nicely in the long term (so that you can enjoy your older age, as with pension funds). Here is what information theory tells us to do (in reality you will, most likely, get a financial advisor who will do all the thinking, calculating, and investing for you, but I would like to show you what kind of calculations they do. And remember, they also take a percentage – if you do it yourself you could be better off in the final analysis).

Let's take the top-10 FTSE (this is the London Financial Times Stock Exchange) companies at present. They are more likely to remain in the top-100 for quite some time and not to go under any time soon. Say you have a lump sum of $1000 that you would want to invest across these 10 companies. You first want to estimate the probabilities that these companies will make a positive return to you (i.e. you will win by investing in them). To estimate these probabilities (no one gives them to you) you can look at the past performance of the companies as well as current market conditions and strategies. The better your understanding of all the public information available about this company the more accurately you'll be able to estimate your probabilities and hence hope to derive an optimal betting strategy. This is the full-time job of City analysts. This is what they do 80 hours a week, every week (currently it's gone up to 90 hours a week, as a friend of mine reliably tells me). However even with only the basic level of research and approximate probabilities you can still make a good return by spreading your investment according to Shannon.

The share value of a company will sometimes go up and sometimes come down; in other words, there will be some natural fluctuation in the market. Overall, however, if the company is financially and strategically sound, and top-100 FTSE companies tend to be more so, then they will demonstrate an overall upward trend in the long term.

Using all this publically available information, we can estimate the probability that a company will make 3% next year. This is not as difficult as it initially looks (if we just want rough estimates). If it has made more than 3% every year for the past 50 years and analysts expect it to make 10% next year then the probability of it making 3% is fairly high. This way you can estimate the probabilities of certain returns for Company X.

Note that Thorp did not have the problem of estimating probabilities in playing blackjack, as the set of outcomes is well known, and by reading the cards he was able to recalculate probabilities. In fact, this is the exact reason why Thorp chose blackjack over other games such as slot machines (with a slot machine there is no prior information you could use to predict the next outcome). While playing blackjack Thorp was able to estimate future probabilities by seeing what cards had already been presented and adjusting his betting strategy appropriately. Following the performances of companies is like following cards.

In the highly unlikely event of the reader not being familiar with the game of blackjack (in which case I urge you to get out more) I'll give a brief overview. The basic premise of the game is that you want to have a hand value that is closer to 21 points than that of the dealer (without going over 21; if you do, you lose). Each card is worth a certain number of points and the dealer hands them out upon request. Other players at the table are of no concern, other than the fact that you can memorize their cards and adjust your probabilities appropriately. Your hand is strictly played out against the hand of the dealer. To determine whether to ask for another card, Thorp was simply using Shannon's formula into which he inserted the estimated probabilities.

Let's say we are playing against the dealer in a Vegas casino. We have three cards in front of us totaling 15 points and the dealer is asking us whether we want another card. So now we are thinking, what are the chances of the next card being six or less? Intuitively, given that we have already seen four sixes, three fives, three fours, and three twos, and three aces, we already have more information than somebody who wasn't paying any attention. Whereas somebody else may take the risk we know that logically there is a lower chance of seeing a card that will not take us over 21. So Shannon's formula just formalizes this and indicates when it is and isn't a good time to take a risk.

Walking into a casino may be a risky proposition altogether, especially if you are borrowing mafia money to gamble. So, let's think of a more wholesome scenario. After all why worry about casinos when gambling is fully legalized in the great global financial market of ours (I apologise to the reader for the slight cynicism as I sit here in October 2008 watching my pension fund taking a hammering).

We can extrapolate Shannon's formula and use it to invest in the stock market. Let us assume that one company has a 55% chance of a 3% return over a year, another has a 60% chance, and so on. How should we now invest? The best investment intuitively would be to invest proportionally. Namely you should invest most in the company that has highest returning odds, less into the next one, and so on. If one company has a twice higher chance of yielding the same positive return on your capital, then you should invest twice as much into it. And how about the return on your investment – how much would that be? The expected return would amazingly enough be exactly equal to Shannon's information formula! How can this be understood?

I would like to take a concrete example, just to show you how much you can objectively really earn in practice. Suppose that you are only investing into a top company and that it has a 55% chance of winning you money in a day. Say, as before, that you have $1000 to invest. First of all, information theory says that you should not invest more than 2 times 55 minus 100% (2 × 55 - 100) of your money. This comes out to 10%, which is $100. The reason for this is that you need a buffer if you lose money – you would still like to be able to keep playing. It is only if you keep playing that the loot can add up to a substantial amount.

You have now invested $100. Shannon's information theory says that the rate at which your profit will increase is 0.5%. This means that you will have gained 50 cents. Next day, if things have not changed, you will also get 0.5%, but now you have started with $100 and 50 cents – which is more than the first time, being 50 cents and 0.5% of 50 cents, and so on . . . At the beginning you will not notice much change, but the growth is basically exponential (all exponentials are linear to start with which is why they do not look impressive initially). After one year – 365 days – you will end up doubling your money to $200. Next year you would have $400, then eight, and after five years you would have gained 16 times more than you started with. This rate of increase seems much better than the rate of inflation which is eating away at your capital if you are lazy with it and keep it safe in your bank and uninvested.

The earnings in the previous paragraph still may not sound all that much, but remember that you only invested a $100 in the first place. What if you'd invested $100,000? You would still earn 0.5% on top of it, but this would now be $500 (per day!). And all this for doing nothing, ‘just (in this case very slightly) risking' the possibility of losing your money.

Shannon's formula will also tell us that you should not bet on anything that is completely uncertain (so don't play the lottery if you listen to Kelly's advice). If the chances of success are only 50%, then you would be wise to abstain from betting. On average you will gain nothing and in all probability you will lose everything.

Now let's link the discussion of financial markets and monetary speculations to the previous chapter, namely to the concept of Maxwell's demon. Can we use thermodynamics to describe the overall behaviour of markets and to deduce some very general trends in the financial world?

There is an obvious way in which thermodynamics affects markets. The price of something is clearly driven by the supply and demand principle and if the resources are scarce, then the price will be pushed up. As we have seen, thermodynamics implies that our energy resources will be getting depleted as well as causing other unpleasant effects on our planet as they wind down. This is bound to have an effect on the economy in general and we, in fact, see this kind of stuff around us all the time. The price of petrol is linked to oil and this in turn depends on the reserves of oil as well as on its availability. Even the slightest sniff of a conflict in the Middle East pushes up the world petrol prices.

However, thermodynamics and economics are more closely linked than this. The behaviour of financial markets itself, in some sense, quite closely mirrors the behaviour of physical systems in thermodynamics. There is a general law in finance that you hear repeated very frequently: ‘that in an efficient market there is no financial gain without risk'. Anything worth doing must, according to this law, have a (significant) probability of failure associated with it. If something is a sure thing, you can bet that the reward is going to be negligible.

This sounds very much like the statement that in order to produce some useful work, you must be prepared to waste some heat. The Second Law of thermodynamics tells us that you must increase the temperature of your environment in order to do work and this is synonymous with the fact that the house takes more money than is proportionally fair (i.e. on average it always costs you more to win than you earn). Let us go back to the simple game of betting in a casino to illustrate this point further. We would like to argue that money will play the role of energy.

But, wait a minute – you will say, how can that be when money, unlike energy itself, is not quite conserved? Money can be generated out of nowhere while energy, as we have seen, cannot. If we have more people in the world, there will be more money around, so money is obviously not a constant. However, if we assume that we have a person betting against the casino in a house, then the total amount of money is fixed. The money could be in a person's pocket or it could be in the casino's safe, but it has to be somewhere. So, only under these specific conditions, is money conserved and can be compared with energy.

Now we can state the rules of betting in the casino in a way that we recover analogues of the laws of thermodynamics. First of all, the odds given by the house are such that:

1 ‘You cannot win the game'. This means that if the probability for something is one third, your return will at most be three times your investment. So, if you invest $10 you will get at most $30 back, but with an overwhelming probability – two-thirds (67%) – you will lose. On average as you continue the game, you will not win anything. This is the exact analogue of the First Law of thermodynamics – you cannot get something for nothing.

The Second Law of betting is even more depressing, since casinos are designed in such a way that

2 ‘You cannot even break even'. This means that you will never get the fair odds, plus in a real casino you will have to pay to enter, you will have to pay to play, you will – most likely – be buying some drinks and tipping the casino personnel as you go along. All this contributes to the fact that while money is overall conserved it has the tendency to move from your pocket into the casino safe and not the other way round. This is the analogue of entropy increase in thermodynamics, where heat always flows from a hot to a cold body and never the other way round. So, in casino betting, the player is ‘hot', while the casino is ‘cool', and this determines the direction of the flow of money.

Now, there is also a Third Law of thermodynamics, which, of course, also has its analogue in betting. It says that:

3 ‘You cannot quit the game'.

I will leave the reader to interpret the meaning of this statement themselves. Suffice it to say that gamblers usually gamble till the bitter end. The laws of betting are just so very similar to the laws of thermodynamics (the Third Law of thermodynamics being the one prohibiting us from reaching absolute zero; in gambling terms this means being cooler than anything else, in particular the casino itself).

All the discussion so far can simply be summarized by saying that Shannon's formula for the maximum channel capacity, Boltzmann's formula for physical entropy, and Kelly's formula for maximizing profit are all one and the same formula.

However, what is really surprising is that betting can be seen as a very fruitful metaphor for the evolution of life itself. We can think of random mutations as producing different gambling strategies, each with a different likelihood of success. This is exactly what a biologist, Frederic Warburton, analysed in one of his papers.

Warburton views evolution as a game between an individual (the gambler) and its environment (the house). Profiting in evolutionary terms means that, regardless of the environment, life will propagate. Losing means that life will end. So the game is as follows: the individual produces copies of itself, but naturally the copy will be slightly different due to random mutations. They may arise from the environment (due to cosmic rays, say) or some error in transcription. These mutations lead to a slightly altered set of properties in the new individuals, which are then tested by Nature and the environment. The number of individuals produced depends very much on the gambling strategy being employed. Any individual produced will have to be fed and nurtured and, given that resources are finite, we must choose how many copies to make in line with these restrictions. The new individuals then either pass the evolution test and further multiply (i.e. they generate profit) or they fail and die (i.e. the investment is lost). In economics, this is known as the principle of increasing returns. It is now clear that those that survive profit more and more in the sense that their strategy mirrors the environment better and better. Thus life increases profitability and evolution becomes a gambling game.

However, as always there is a snag; the more profitable life becomes the less profitable its environment (as it increases proportionally in entropy). As the environment increases in entropy, this makes it more and more difficult for life to propagate. In a similar manner, as you become more profitable in a casino (analogous to the environment) it in turn necessarily affects your profit in the long term through several consequences: it may reduce its payouts, charge a percentage tax on your winnings, or perhaps pack up altogether. Given that there is even a charge for playing the game in the first place, we can see how the second principle of betting manifests itself: namely that you cannot even break even.

We said that we can view life as a Maxwell's demon trying to keep low entropy locally, while increasing the entropy of its environment. In fact, as we saw, the more we keep the local entropy low the more we will keep increasing the total entropy of the system. Can the total entropy increase therefore be an indicator of life? Could we scan other planets for their entropy content to determine whether any life exists on them?

This is a fascinating question and the answer is that the total entropy production, while important, is probably not the only relevant factor. Out of all planets and moons in the Solar System, Mercury has the highest entropy production per unit area, but as far as we know, it has no life. The answer most likely lies in the fact that Mercury has no atmosphere and an atmosphere provides a medium for transport of matter that is crucial for living processes to take place.

The Earth and the Moon share the second place for the highest entropy production, which is roughly a quarter that of Mercury. The Moon again has virtually no atmosphere (it is gravitationally too weak to attract atoms to its surface) and this makes it difficult to have life. The rest of the planets and moons have entropy production far lower (Mars is fourth with two-thirds of the entropy production of the Earth or Moon).

Therefore, the total entropy production is very relevant for life, but it seems to be only a part of the story. However, there are other more dramatic options. It could also be that we have to enlarge our definition of life, and then we will recognize it in other places. Given, however, that it is very difficult to specify all the features of life (are viruses living or not?), entropy production seems to be quite a good single indicator.

Another important feature of life is that it becomes more complex. Let us see if we are able to quantify this trend more precisely, based on the discussion so far. Let us define complexity as the difference between a maximally disordered state, i.e. a maximum entropy, and the actual entropy with respect to the local environment (a thermodynamicist called Peter Landsberg actually proposed this definition). Natural selection favours organisms that minimize entropy with respect to environment (the best gamblers in the language of this chapter). Those that don't, die out. Therefore, mutations will eventually lead to lower local entropy which, given that we subtract from the maximal total entropy to get complexity, results in increased complexity of life. It might be worth noting that it isn't that all life forms become more complex with time – obviously they don't and many are highly successful as they are and have been around for ages (e.g. types of bacteria). But more complex forms appear over time and it is this increase in some forms we are trying to explain.

The increase of complexity of life with time is now seen to be a direct consequence of evolution: random mutations and natural selection. In fact, the famous Oxford biologist Richard Dawkins has argued passionately in a number of his popular accounts that evolution is the only theory we have that can explain all the living complexity we see around us. Given that we stated that life may maximize total entropy production this may imply that it also maximizes complexity increase. Biological complexity is therefore the same as the successful gambler's profit and it grows in the same way.

Through analysis of betting and financial speculation and then synthesis of its fundamental principles, we can see another example of how information seems to be the most natural framework within which to discuss such ideas. We extend this approach again in the next chapter to discuss the social interactions that define how we live and the quality of our lives.

押上你的赌注：为胜利而战

到目前为止，我们已经讨论了生命如何繁衍以及最终如何终结；但我猜想我们大多数人最关心的其实是「人生的中间过程」。在本章中，我想把注意力放在这两个极端之间，好好享受当下。我们还能奢求什么呢？至少对我来说，我渴望的是那份刺激感。

虽然「刺激」这个概念因人而异，但大多数人都会认同：没有一点风险，就很难获得真正的刺激（说实话，太过确定的事情总是让人觉得乏味）。所以，让我们积极拥抱生活，一起来探讨如何让生活变得更加精彩刺激。

这里是 1962 年的拉斯维加斯，一座让人梦寐以求的城市。在这里，财富每分每秒都在易手，数以百万计的金钱此起彼伏。这座城市见证了无数怀揣梦想的赌徒，他们借来盘缠，穿越内华达沙漠来此一搏。或许能衣锦还乡成为百万富翁，又或许会落魄而归。但今天注定与众不同。一位新的赌场「牛仔」来到了这座城市。当他步入赌场的那一刻，音乐奏响，摄像机聚焦，美酒和美人唾手可得。他的目光扫视全场，一旦锁定 21 点桌，便毫不犹豫地直奔而去。在这个扑克称霸的赌城，为何这位主顾却独钟于 21 点？原来他胸有成竹，认为自己掌握了一个能够制胜庄家的策略。他口袋里装着 1 万美元（在 1962 年这可是笔巨款，相当于如今的 25 万美元），显然是要大干一场。

这名玩家最初像所有新手一样小心谨慎，只下些小注，看起来毫不起眼。但当其他赌客陆续离开牌桌时，他仍在坚持。渐渐地，他的策略开始显现成效。当然，赌场向来就不喜欢赢家，对那些以冷静且系统性手法展现出极高效率的玩家更是格外警惕。尽管赌场保安一直在严密监视他，却始终无法找出他的取胜秘诀。他们百思不得其解：为什么这个玩家能够一直赢钱？为什么他不能和其他人一样乖乖认输？于是他们又让他继续玩了几个小时，最后认定不能再继续下去，将他请出了赌场。有趣的是，只要某位玩家的赢利开始超出赌场的统计预期（按理说玩家应该是在输钱才对！），赌场就有权将其请出门外。在那个周末，这位玩家几乎造访了拉斯维加斯的每一家赌场，最终都被这些赌场逐一驱逐。不过他依然满载而归，从拉斯维加斯赢得了 2.1 万美元（是他最初投入的两倍还多）。

原来他叫 Edward Thorp，而且他还是 MIT 的一位数学教授。后来他将自己的经历和赌场制胜策略写成了一本书《战胜庄家》，这本书随后成为了畅销书，销量突破了 70 万册。那么，他究竟用了什么策略呢？（说起来，真让人好奇，究竟是谁愿意借给一个大学教授 25 万美元去赌场呢？）

2『这个故事在其他地方看过好几次，反正是跟香农有关的，可能在香农传里。已下载原文书籍「2024119Beat-the-Dealer」。（2024-11-05）』

Edward Thorp 同样也热衷于冒险。不过他深知，只要按照特定方式行事，就能将风险控制在可控范围内，并在长期获得可观收益。那么究竟多大的风险才是最合适的呢？这个问题的答案 —— 你可能难以置信 —— 其实也遵循着 Shannon 的信息理论，当然前提是你要以获胜为目标。

Edward Thorp 深入研究过 Shannon 以及其在贝尔实验室（Bell Labs）同事 J. L. Kelly 的研究成果。Kelly 的论文比 Shannon 的晚了约 10 年才发表，这是首次将 Shannon 的理念应用于投资决策领域的开创性工作，也是首个对 Shannon 信息论的扩展性研究。值得注意的是，在这整整 10 年时间里，竟然没有出现其他对信息论的扩展性研究。这并非因为学术界需要很长时间才接受 Shannon 的理论，恰恰相反，他的论文一问世就引起轰动。真正的原因在于，Shannon 的研究成果实在太过完整，论证又极其严密，以至于其他研究者都无法在其基础上做出更多贡献！那么，Kelly 又是如何在 Shannon 的理论基础上开辟新天地的呢？

请记住，当不太可能发生的事情发生时，信息增益是最大的，这也正是能带来最大惊喜和（可能的）兴奋感的原因。要体验这种兴奋感，最好的方式就是走进赌场，对一些小概率事件下注，比如掷出蛇眼（snake eyes，即在一次掷骰子中两个骰子同时显示数字一）。这种情况发生的概率是 1/36（因为每个骰子有六个数字，六乘以六等于 36）。正是因为这个事件发生的概率很小，所以一旦你赢了就会获得丰厚的奖励。相比之下，如果下注偶数这样的常见组合，由于其 50/50 的概率，获得的回报就会小得多。如果赌场是公平的（当然实际上没有哪家赌场是真正公平的，这一点从 Thorp 被驱逐出拉斯维加斯就可见一斑），那么当你在蛇眼上押 1 美元并且赢了，就应该获得 36 美元的回报。这样的回报率确实相当可观！

当然，你并不一定要在赌场下注，你也可以选择将资金投资于企业。对于一家公司而言，如果它规模越小、知名度越低，在现有市场条件和商业策略下成功的可能性越小，那么一旦它真的成功了，相同投资额度所能带来的回报就越高。这种现象与我们之前讨论的信息理论非常相似：某个事件发生的概率越小，其信息增益（information gain）就越大，而在投资领域，信息量越大，潜在收益也就越高。因此，Shannon 的信息原理不仅适用于信息领域，在商业世界中同样发挥着作用。而且，与赌场相比，投资公司的成功率实际上更加公平（当然，这是建立在有效市场假设的基础上）。

我们每个人都渴望成功，没有人希望成为输家。那么，信息论是否能为我们指明方向，帮助我们提高成功的概率呢？虽然这个问题的答案听起来让人难以置信，但确实是肯定的。在金融投机领域，追求利润最大化与通信领域追求信道容量最大化，本质上是同一个问题。我们知道，Shannon 在第三章已经解决了后者。因此，我们只需要把这个解决方案应用到其他领域即可。根据 Shannon 的理论，当消息长度符合「逆概率对数」规则时，通信信道可以达到最大容量。如果我们把成功投资所获得的收益看作是「消息长度」，就可以得到 City of London 和华尔街交易员所说的「对数最优投资组合」（log optimal portfolio）。

这就是对数最优投资组合（log optimal portfolio）在实践中的运作方式。其基本原理是要尽可能地分散投资，也就是不要把所有资金都押注在同一个项目上。这样做的原因在于我们希望能够进行长期投资（并且希望能持续获得收益）。如果你将所有资金都集中在一处，而不幸在一开始就遭遇损失（这完全可能只是运气不好），那么你就没有资金继续进行后续投资了。这种情况与信息通信类似，某些投资可能需要投入大量资金，而有些则只需要很小的投入。那么，我们究竟应该如何确定每次的投资规模呢？

让我们假设你是一位喜欢稳健投资、着眼长远的投资者 —— 就像一位精于理财的行家。你打算投资 20 年，虽然不追求每年都有特别高的回报率，但希望资金能在长期内稳步增长（这样就能像养老基金一样，让你安享晚年）。下面我们就来看看根据信息论的指导，应该如何进行投资（虽然在现实中，你很可能会找一位财务顾问来帮你完成所有的分析、计算和投资决策，但我想给你展示一下他们是如何进行这些计算的。别忘了，这些顾问是要收取一定比例的管理费的 —— 如果你能自己操作，从长远来看可能会获得更好的收益）。

让我们来看看目前伦敦金融时报股票交易所指数（FTSE）排名前 10 的公司。这些公司很可能在相当长一段时间内都能保持在前 100 名，并且短期内不会面临倒闭风险。假设你有 1000 美元的一次性投资资金，想要分散投资到这 10 家公司。首先，你需要评估投资这些公司能获得正收益的概率（也就是投资能赚钱的可能性）。要估算这些概率并不容易，因为没有人会直接告诉你答案。你需要研究这些公司的历史业绩表现、当前市场状况以及他们的经营策略。你对公司公开信息了解得越全面，就越能准确地估算出这些概率，从而制定出更优的投资策略。

这正是伦敦金融城分析师们的日常工作。他们每周要工作 80 个小时来做这些研究和分析（根据我朋友最新透露的消息，现在工作时间已经增加到每周 90 小时）。不过，即使你只能做基础的研究和粗略的概率估算，只要按照 Shannon 信息论的投资策略来分散投资，你仍然有机会获得不错的回报。

一家公司的股价会有涨有跌，这是市场的正常波动规律。不过从整体来看，如果这家公司具备扎实的财务基础和战略实力（这一点在富时 100 指数的成分股公司中尤为明显），那么从长期来看，它的股价走势必然会呈现上升趋势。

通过分析这些公开信息，我们可以预测一家公司明年达到 3% 回报率的可能性。这样的预测工作其实并不像表面看起来那么复杂（特别是当我们只需要粗略估算时）。举例来说，如果一家公司在过去 50 年里每年的回报率都超过 3%，而且分析师预计明年能达到 10% 的回报率，那么这家公司明年至少实现 3% 回报率的可能性就相当高。用这种方法，我们就能够预估任何一家公司在不同回报率水平上的实现概率。

值得注意的是，在玩二十一点（Blackjack）时，Thorp 并不需要面对概率估算的困扰，因为这个游戏中所有可能的结果都是已知的，他只需要通过观察牌面就能重新计算出概率。这也正是 Thorp 选择二十一点而非其他游戏的根本原因 —— 比如老虎机这类游戏，玩家完全无法从当前状况预测下一个结果。在二十一点游戏中，Thorp 可以通过观察已经打出的牌来估算未来出牌的概率，从而适时调整自己的下注策略。这种做法与追踪分析公司表现有异曲同工之妙 —— 两者都是通过观察已知信息来预测未来走势。

如果你还不了解二十一点这个游戏（说真的，这时候我建议你该多出去社交了），让我来简单介绍一下。这个游戏的基本规则是：你要争取获得一手比庄家更接近 21 点的牌面点数（注意不能超过 21 点，一旦超过就输了）。每张牌都有特定的点数，玩家可以向庄家要牌。虽然牌桌上可能还有其他玩家，但他们的存在仅仅是让你有机会记住他们的牌来调整概率预判而已。因为本质上，你只是在和庄家对战。在决定是否要牌时，Thorp 采用的策略很简单：他把计算出的概率数据代入 Shannon 的公式中进行运算。

想象一下我们正在拉斯维加斯赌场里玩 21 点。我们面前的三张牌加起来是 15 点，这时荷官问我们要不要继续要牌。此时我们在思考：下一张牌是 6 或更小的可能性有多大？凭直觉来说，我们已经看到了六点的牌有 4 张、五点的有 3 张、四点的有 3 张、二点的有 3 张，还有 3 张 A，这比那些没有留意观察的人掌握了更多信息。其他人可能会冒然要牌，但我们清楚地知道，得到一张不会让我们爆牌（超过 21 点）的机会实际上很小。这就是为什么香农信息论（Shannon's formula）能够将这种直觉形式化，帮助我们判断什么时候值得冒险，什么时候应该保守。

说到赌场，光是踏进赌场的门槛就已经是个风险不小的决定了，更不用说如果你还是借了黑手党的钱去赌博。不过我们不妨想想其他更正面的场景。话说回来，在如今这个完全合法化的全球金融市场里，我们似乎也不必太在意传统的赌场了（请原谅我有点打趣的语气，毕竟我正坐在这里，眼看着自己的养老金在 2008 年 10 月遭受重创）。

我们可以将 Shannon 信息公式（Shannon's formula）推广应用到股票市场投资中。假设这样一个场景：一家公司在一年内有 55% 的可能性获得 3% 的收益率，另一家公司的可能性是 60%，以此类推。在这种情况下，我们该如何进行投资呢？从投资策略来看，按比例分配投资似乎是最合理的选择。具体来说，就是将最多的资金配置给收益概率最高的公司，然后依次递减。比如说，如果某家公司获得同样正收益率的概率是另一家的两倍，那么投入到这家公司的资金也应该是另一家的两倍。那么，这种投资方式最终能带来多少收益呢？有个令人称奇的发现：预期收益率竟然完全符合 Shannon 信息公式！这个现象背后究竟蕴含着怎样的原理呢？

让我们来看一个具体的例子，这样你就能清楚地了解在实际操作中可以获得多少收益。假设你只投资一家顶级公司，而且每天有 55% 的概率获得正收益。我们假定你有 1000 美元的投资资金。首先，根据信息论原理，你的投资金额不应该超过一个特定比例，这个比例等于（2 × 55 - 100)%，也就是 10%，相当于 100 美元。这么做是有原因的：你需要预留足够的资金作为亏损缓冲 —— 这样才能确保你有能力继续投资。要实现可观的收益，持续性的投资是关键。

假设你投资了 100 美元。根据香农信息论的计算，你的每日收益率是 0.5%，这意味着第一天你会赚到 50 美分。到第二天，如果市场状况保持不变，你仍然能获得 0.5% 的收益，但这时你的本金已经变成了 100.5 美元，所以当天的收益会比第一天略高。这个过程会不断重复。虽然在最初阶段，这种增长看起来并不明显，但实际上这是一个指数增长的过程。(所有的指数增长在初期都表现得像直线一样缓慢，这就是为什么人们往往会低估它的威力）。经过一年（365 天）后，你的投资会翻倍达到 200 美元。再过一年就会增长到 400 美元，之后是 800 美元，到第五年时，你的投资金额将达到最初的 16 倍。相比之下，如果你把钱闲置在银行账户中不进行投资，面对通货膨胀，你的资金实际购买力反而会逐渐减少。

虽然前面提到的收益数字乍听之下可能不算很多，但别忘了你最初的投资只有 100 美元。假设你投资 100,000 美元会怎样呢？同样是 0.5% 的收益率，但现在就变成了 500 美元（而且是每天！）。最神奇的是，这些收益完全是坐享其成的结果，只需承担极小的资金损失风险。

信息论之父 Shannon 的公式还告诉我们一个重要道理：永远不要在完全不确定的事情上下注（如果你认同 Kelly 准则的话，就应该远离彩票）。如果某事的成功概率仅有 50%，最明智的选择就是不要参与。因为从平均来看，你不仅得不到任何收益，反而很可能会赔得一干二净。

现在，让我们把金融市场和货币投机的讨论与上一章的 Maxwell 魔鬼（一个经典的热力学思想实验）概念联系起来。我们能否用热力学原理来解释市场的整体行为，从而找出金融世界中的一些基本规律？

热力学对市场的影响是显而易见的。商品价格基本遵循供需规律，当资源稀缺时，价格就会上涨。热力学规律告诉我们，能源资源终将耗竭，而在这个消耗过程中还会对地球造成负面环境影响。这种影响必然会波及整个经济体系，这一点我们在日常生活中就能经常观察到。比如汽油价格与石油价格密切相关，而石油价格又受到全球石油储备量和供应状况的影响。甚至中东地区稍有动荡的迹象，就足以导致全球汽油价格上涨。

事实上，热力学和经济学之间的联系远比想象的更加紧密。从某个角度来看，金融市场的运行规律与热力学中的物理系统惊人地相似。在金融界有一条广为流传的基本法则：在有效市场（efficient market）中，收益必然伴随着风险。按照这个法则，任何值得投资的机会都必然存在着（显著的）失败可能性。如果某个投资看起来稳赚不赔，那么其回报必定微乎其微。

这一现象与热力学中的一个基本原理非常相似：要产生有用功，就必须付出一定的热量代价。热力学第二定律告诉我们，做功必然会导致环境温度升高，这与赌场永远占据优势（即从长期来看，玩家投入的成本总是高于可能获得的收益）的原理异曲同工。为了更好地理解这一点，让我们以简单的赌场博彩为例，在这个例子中，我们可以将金钱视作能量来进行分析。

这时你可能会质疑：既然金钱与能量不同，不具有完全的守恒性，那这种类比是否恰当呢？金钱可以被创造出来，而能量如我们所知是不能被创造的。随着世界人口的增加，货币数量也会随之增加，因此金钱显然不是一个恒定值。不过，如果我们将场景限定在一个人在赌场中进行博弈的情况下，那么系统中的总金额是固定的。这笔钱要么在玩家的口袋里，要么在赌场的保险箱中，但总会在某个地方。因此，仅在这种特定条件下，金钱才具有守恒性，才能与能量进行类比。

现在，我们可以通过赌场的博弈规则来建立与热力学定律相对应的类比关系。首先，让我们来看看赌场制定的赔率规则：

「你永远无法在这场游戏中获胜」。这句话的含义是：如果某个事件发生的概率是三分之一，那么你的回报最多只能是投入的三倍。举个例子，如果你投入 10 美元，最多只能获得 30 美元的回报，而且有高达三分之二（约 67%）的概率会亏损。从长期平均来看，随着游戏的进行，你不会获得任何收益。这正好类似于热力学第一定律 —— 能量既不会凭空产生，也不会凭空消失。

赌博的第二定律则更加悲观，因为赌场在设计上...「你永远无法实现收支平衡」。这意味着你永远不可能获得真正公平的赌博机会，更何况在现实的赌场中，你还要支付入场费、游戏费用，还可能会买一些饮品，给赌场员工小费。所有这些因素都印证了一个事实：尽管金钱在理论上是守恒的，但它总是倾向于从赌客的口袋流向赌场的金库，而不会反其道而行。这种现象与热力学中的熵增现象非常相似 —— 就像热量永远都是从高温物体流向低温物体，永远不会自发地反向流动一样。因此，在赌场中，我们可以把赌客比作「高温体」，把赌场比作「低温体」，这就决定了金钱流动的必然方向。

热力学中还有一个第三定律，有趣的是，它在赌博领域也有相应的对应规律。这个规律是：

「你永远无法退出游戏」。

让我们留给读者自己去思考这句话的深意。不过有一点是显而易见的：赌徒往往会一直赌下去，直到最后一刻。赌博的规律与热力学定律惊人地相似（就像热力学第三定律告诉我们无法达到绝对零度一样，在赌场里，你永远不可能做到比其他人，尤其是比赌场更「冷静」）。

前面的所有讨论都可以归结为一个令人着迷的发现：Shannon 提出的最大信道容量公式、Boltzmann 的物理熵公式，以及 Kelly 的利润最大化公式，本质上都是同一个数学公式的不同表现形式。

更加令人惊叹的是，博彩竟然可以成为理解生命进化过程的绝佳例子。我们可以把生物的随机突变看作是不同的赌博策略，每种策略都有其独特的成功概率。生物学家 Frederic Warburton 在他的一篇论文中，就详细分析了这种独特的联系。

Warburton 巧妙地把进化过程比作一场博弈：生物个体就像赌徒，而环境则扮演着赌场庄家的角色。从进化的角度来看，「赢钱」就意味着生命能在各种环境中成功繁衍后代，而「输掉赌注」则意味着生命的终结。这场独特的博弈是这样进行的：生物个体不断产生自己的复制品，但由于随机突变的存在，这些复制品总会与原版略有不同。这些突变可能来自环境因素（比如宇宙射线的影响），也可能是基因复制过程中出现的错误。突变使得新产生的个体具有了与父代略微不同的特征，这些特征随后要接受自然环境的检验。至于能产生多少个体，很大程度上取决于物种采取的「押注策略」。每个新生个体都需要获取营养和照料，而由于资源总是有限的，物种必须权衡如何在这些限制下决定繁殖数量。这些新个体要么通过自然选择的考验并继续繁衍（相当于获得收益），要么失败淘汰（相当于赌注损失）。经济学中有个类似的概念叫做收益递增原理。显而易见，那些能够存活下来的个体会越来越「盈利」，因为它们的生存策略与环境越来越匹配。这样，生命在这场持续不断的博弈中不断提升自己的「获胜概率」，完美诠释了进化的本质。

然而，这里存在一个问题：生命系统越是繁荣，其周围环境就越趋向混乱（因为环境的熵（entropy）会相应增加）。随着环境熵的增加，生命的繁衍就变得越来越困难。这种情况就像在赌场赌博一样：当你赢得越多（环境类比），赌场就会通过各种方式影响你的长期收益，比如降低赔率、抽取佣金，甚至直接停业。考虑到玩游戏本身就要付费，这正好印证了赌博的第二原则：你永远都不可能实现收支平衡。

我们此前提到，生命可以被视为一个麦克斯韦妖（Maxwell's demon），它试图在局部维持低熵状态，同时却增加了环境的熵。事实上，我们观察到，系统局部的熵越低，整个系统的总熵增加得就越多。那么，我们是否可以将总熵的增加作为寻找生命的一个指标呢？我们能否通过测量其他行星的熵值变化来判断它们是否存在生命呢？

这是一个非常有趣的问题。虽然总熵产生量（total entropy production）很重要，但它可能并非唯一的关键因素。在太阳系的所有行星和卫星中，水星的单位面积熵产生率最高，但据我们目前所知，它上面并没有生命存在。这很可能是因为水星缺乏大气层，而大气层作为物质运输的媒介，对生命过程的产生和维持起着至关重要的作用。

在熵产生率排名中，地球和月球并列位居第二，其数值约为水星的 25%。月球因其引力较弱，几乎无法在表面维持大气层（无法将气体分子吸引在表面），这使得生命难以在其上存在。其他行星和卫星的熵产生率则更低，其中火星排名第四，其熵产生率约为地球或月球的 67%。

因此，总熵产生（total entropy production）对生命而言确实具有重要意义，但这似乎只是整个问题的一个方面。不过，还存在其他更引人深思的可能性。比如，我们可能需要拓展对生命的定义，这样也许能在其他领域发现生命的新形式。不过，由于要完整定义生命的所有特征本身就十分困难（比如我们至今仍在争论病毒是否算作生命），从这个角度来看，熵的产生倒是成为了一个相当可靠的独立判断指标。

生命的另一个重要特征是它会变得越来越复杂。根据我们之前的讨论，让我们来看看能否更准确地衡量这种趋势。我们可以用一个特别的方法来定义复杂性：它是最大混乱状态（也就是最大熵）与实际环境中的熵值之间的差异。这个定义最初是由热力学家 Peter Landsberg 提出的。在自然选择中，那些能够在所处环境中维持较低熵值的生物（用本章的说法就是那些最善于「赌博」的生物）更容易存活下来，而做不到这一点的生物则会逐渐消亡。因此，生物通过突变最终会降低它们的局部熵值，而根据我们的定义，熵值的降低就意味着复杂性的提升。不过需要注意的是，这并不意味着所有生命形式都会随着时间变得更复杂 —— 显然不是这样的。许多生物，比如某些细菌，以它们现有的形式就已经很成功了，并且已经存在了很长时间。我们要解释的是，为什么会随着时间的推移出现更复杂的生命形式，以及某些生物为什么会变得更加复杂。

现在科学家们认为，生命随时间逐渐变得复杂是进化的直接结果，这个过程主要通过随机突变和自然选择来实现。著名的牛津大学生物学家 Richard Dawkins 在他的多部科普著作中强有力地证明，进化论是目前唯一能够解释我们周围所观察到的生命复杂性的理论。我们之前提到生命可能会使熵的总体产生达到最大值，这可能也意味着生命在推动复杂度不断提升。因此，生物复杂性的增长规律与成功赌徒获取利润的方式有着异曲同工之妙。

通过对博彩和金融投机活动的分析，以及对其基本原理的归纳，我们发现信息理论为讨论这些观点提供了最自然的框架。在下一章中，我们将进一步拓展这种方法，探讨那些决定我们生活方式和生活质量的社会互动。

### Key points

It is possible to use Shannon's logic to drive betting strategies for maximizing profit.

If you want to win in a casino, you must invest according to the probabilities for various gambling outcomes. Low probability should deserve a correspondingly low investment.

Gambling on a completely random event is really gambling of the lowest order, and in the long run you'll never make a profit (given that half the time you win and half the time you will lose).

If you follow Shannon's logic, your return on an investment will be according to Shannon's entropy. In finance, this way of spreading your bets is known as the log optimal portfolio approach and is widely used as the basis for investment decisions.

Life is also a form of gambling, where life wins by propagating itself. The degree to which it wins is related to the length of time for which it propagates.

关键要点：

我们可以运用信息论奠基人香农（Shannon）的理论来制定能够实现利润最大化的投资策略。

如果你想在赌场中盈利，就必须根据不同赌博结果的概率来合理分配投资。对于低概率事件，相应的投资额度也应该降低。

在完全随机事件上押注实际上是最基础的赌博形式，从长期来看你不可能获得盈利（因为输赢各占一半的概率）。

如果遵循 Shannon 信息论的原理，你的投资回报将与 Shannon 熵（Shannon entropy）相对应。在金融界，这种根据概率分散投资的策略被称为对数最优投资组合（log optimal portfolio）方法，现已成为许多投资决策的重要理论基础。

生命本身也可以视作一场赌博，其中生命通过延续和繁衍来维持存在。而生命的成功程度，则直接反映在它能够持续繁衍的时间长度上。
