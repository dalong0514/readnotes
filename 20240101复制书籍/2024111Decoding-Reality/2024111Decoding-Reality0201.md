## 0201Information for all Seasons

Imagine that you arrive late at a party. Everyone is already there, sitting at a big round table. The host invites you to sit down with the others and you realize that they are engaged in what appears to be some kind of a game. The host tells you nothing other than to sit down and join in. Let's say that you quite like playing poker, and you get excited at the prospect of participating, but you quickly realize that this is not poker. Then it dawns on you that you actually have absolutely no idea what is going on. You turn around to consult the host, but he seems to have disappeared. You take a deep breath and keep quiet, not wanting to reveal your ignorance quite so early in the evening, and you quietly continue to observe.

The first thing you notice is that no one is allowed to utter any words, so it's not obvious at all whether this is a game. This seems slightly odd but you think this may be one of the rules of the game and so you play along. You observe that the players are using a common deck of cards, resembling Tarot cards, each card with an elaborate picture on it, such as a warrior killing a lion, or a lady holding two crossed swords. After a while it becomes clear that players take turns to reveal a set of cards, one at a time. As each subsequent card is laid down, adjacent to the previous one, the other players closely observe the card being laid down as well as any body language of the player to further substantiate the meaning of the card.

So it's finally the turn of the player sitting next to you. He puts down a king standing over a dead lion with his sword raised above his head; you think to yourself, ‘Is this guy talking about a particular king who killed a lion?', ‘Is he talking about royalty in general?', or ‘Is this card a metaphor for some kind of personal triumph?'. As you develop your thoughts on this, the next card is placed, which is a red dragon. You think initially that this is some kind of metaphor for danger, but when you look at both cards together, you reason that maybe they represent a Welsh king (the red dragon is the national icon of Wales) or perhaps a powerful person facing danger. The next three cards shown are: two crossed blades, a river, and finally a beggar.

By now it's obvious that they are all trying to convey some kind of message to each other through these cards and their body language. And it's also clear that you probably cannot work out the meaning of this game until you have seen a sufficient number of cards. But you start to ask yourself, what exactly are they trying to convey – what is the main point of this activity? Are they telling their life story, making up a story for each other's entertainment, or perhaps is each combination of cards worth a certain number of ‘points'? If it is a game, how do you win it, and if it's not a game, what is the point of it?

A story of this type was imagined by a well-known Italian fiction writer Italo Calvino. The point of his story was that every player is trying to tell others about their life, but only using the images on the cards with a little bit of creative gesticulation and grimacing on the side.

In his book Calvino used this card game as the main metaphor for life. The question is why? Well, it is difficult for me to guess what the writer really wanted to say. Writers are artists, and frequently the point of their work lies precisely in the fact that they are ambiguous and that different people will interpret the same work of art in many different ways. But I am a scientist (as were, incidentally, Calvino's parents) and I'd like to tell you that what Calvino's card game represents is not all that different from how we generate our understanding of reality.

Calvino's card game is like our dialogue with Nature, in other words, the rest of the Universe. Each of the players at the table represents different aspects of Nature and you are the observer. For example, one player could be economics, one player could be physics, one could be biology, and one could be sociology. Each of the players in turn reveals a little more about their own rules and behaviour as time goes on. Nature, like the players, is silent but reveals its intention through events and the surrounding environment. Unsurprisingly, the language Nature uses to communicate is ‘information'. The card game indicates that information comes in discrete units, one card at a time. We cannot divide this card into smaller units. The first message of Calvino's metaphor is therefore that there are basic atoms of information that are universally used. In science, we call these atoms ‘bits' or binary digits. We will discuss these ‘bits' more precisely in Chapter 3.

The second message of Calvino's story is that any sequence of cards, no matter how transparent its message may seem, has still to be interpreted by the observer (in this case you and the other players). The interpretation may, or may not, be true to what the player intended to convey and may vary widely between different observers, and furthermore the observer himself may have several different views of what he has observed. This is synonymous with the inherent uncertainty we find when we observe Nature and two people may have radically different interpretations.

Interestingly, when it is your turn to play, you become the player and Nature becomes the observer. As you lay down your cards, this reflects back on Nature; there is a duality here – you cannot be at the table without affecting the game. This is the third message of Calvino's story, that in real life you are simultaneously the observer as well as being the player.

The fourth message we can draw from Calvino is that the same card can also mean different things based on which other cards it is drawn with. Regardless of who observes it, each card has its own inherent degree of uncertainty, the same red dragon card can mean danger, fear, or represent the country of Wales, depending on the other cards in the set. Once the whole set of cards is presented, the meaning of each card within this context becomes clearer. Therefore relating Calvino's second and fourth points, these cards, as well as representing bits, depend on who interprets them, as well as the other cards they are drawn with. In this sense, we cannot look at any card individually – they must be considered within the context of the sequence of cards they are drawn with. It's no surprise that this property, in science, goes under the general name of ‘contextuality'.

One of the most striking conclusions that follows from this contextuality is that we can never be sure about our interpretation of Nature, given that the next bit of information could falsify our previous view and completely change the essence of the message. In science for example, we could see 1000 experimental results confirming a particular theory, but one subsequent result could completely falsify it and indicate that we have utterly misunderstood the message that Nature is conveying. In Calvino's story, this similarly means that you cannot be sure of the message until the last card in placed on the line. The last card may change the whole point of the story. This is very reminiscent of the Ancient Greek philosopher Socrates' statement that ‘no one should be considered happy until they are dead'. You may be happy for most of your life, but until your last breath you can never be sure that you have had a happy life. We will see that the whole edifice of scientific knowledge also rests on this kind of (somewhat brutal) logic.

Analysing Calvino's game a little more also draws some interesting parallels with our observation of Nature. Like the observer in the story, we humans also arrived late to the game. Taking the game as a metaphor for life, if the game has been progressing for 10 years, we only just arrived a couple of minutes ago. Some elements of Nature, such as physics, have been there since the very beginning. So, a huge amount of information has already been conveyed that we haven't yet taken into account as we generate our model of reality.

Calvino takes the players as granted. The scene is already set but Calvino does not tell us why the game started and who invited the players. He leaves this question open, just as it is open in reality. This raises the same issue of where the players come from, and reduces to the challenge of creation ex nihilo.

Of course, there is much more to interpreting reality than can be portrayed in any story like Calvino's. It does not give us any concrete details or prescriptions of how exactly we should quantify information and apply it to any given situation, let alone the whole Universe. For example, the arrangement of Tarot cards does not lead us to infer a unique story. How do we decide which story is then more likely than others? Or should we maybe not choose a single story, but combine all the stories into some kind of super-story?

Another crucial aspect missing in Calvino's story, if we use it as an analogue of how Nature presents us with information, is to do with the fact that in Calvino's story, once each card is laid, it cannot be changed. Each card has a definite state (its picture) and, whilst this state may be interpreted differently, it cannot change once it has been laid down. For example, a card showing a red dragon cannot ‘magically' change to another card as soon as the next card is drawn, or as soon as it has been observed by someone. As counterintuitive as it may sound, the omission of this interaction between cards, and also between the cards and the players, will be seen to be crucial as we discuss our best physical description of reality, quantum theory, in Part Two of the book.

The reader probably comes to this book with a vague idea of what information is. In everyday parlance information is frequently synonymous with knowledge. We believe we know something when we can talk about it at sufficient length and breadth without being contradicted by any of our listeners. However, although this is the common meaning of the word ‘knowledgeable', it is not what a scientist would consider to be knowledge. To a scientist, any knowledge always refers to the knowledge of the future. Hence historians are not scientists – historians make predictions about the past – but science is all about predictions concerning the future. Neils Bohr, one of the grandfathers of quantum theory, jokingly said on this issue that ‘It is difficult making predictions, especially about the future'.

Guessing what will happen, means that there is always some risk involved. When we are trying to predict the future, we invariably need to make some leaps of imagination, either because the future is intrinsically uncertain or because we do not have enough information about it. This uncertainty was already explored by Calvino, in that we cannot be sure of the message until the last card is placed on the table. The last card may change the whole point of the story. Unlike in Calvino's story, in which there is a finite set of cards, Nature seemingly lays down cards indefinitely. Unfortunately this means that we have to guess the message that Nature is trying to convey as more and more cards become apparent. As a result, we may be proven wrong by a later card, but this is just a necessary risk inherent in how science works.

Typically, a physicist, when studying an atom say, calculates its properties using pen and paper, or more often these days with the aid of a computer. Then, he goes into the laboratory and makes measurements (these days it is typical for those who calculate and those who measure to be different people, but this need not be so). Finally, the physicist compares measurements with his theory, and if the two coincide to sufficient accuracy he is satisfied that his understanding of the phenomenon is good. If the experiment contradicts the theory – and he is certain that there are no crucial experimental errors involved – then the theory, i.e. our interpretation of the message Nature is trying to convey, must be changed.

This is the basis of the scientific method that has helped us understand various aspects of Nature within a short span of 400 years. It is also this same method that can probably be considered one of the defining features of modern civilization.

Whilst we have thus far been driven by the question of why there is information in the Universe and how it is communicated to us by Nature, our ultimate intention is to show how information describes the reality that we observe. We will do this by following Roger Bacon's dictum of ‘analysis and synthesis' and first analyse each of the pillars of reality individually before we synthesize this into an overall unified picture.

Each of the pillars of our reality (players in Calvino's story) will be analysed in terms of how they embody and convey information. While I will be presenting a message from each of these pillars in my own information-centric way, these messages are all well established in the scientific community. The reader may not agree with my ultimate view of encoding reality, but hopefully he or she will find the discussion of the separate pillars valuable in themselves.

The main pillars that we will discuss are:

Chapter 4 – Player 1: Biology. The first major application of information was in biology where genetics developed entirely using the language of information preservation and transmission. Here information is easiest to understand and has a clear and well-defined meaning. Biological information is famed for its endurance, but the underlying principles are in fact universal. We can use them to offer a new framework for running a successful business.

Chapter 5 – Player 2: Thermodynamics. Physics and information have had a long-standing relationship and I use this to talk about the infamous Second Law of thermodynamics. It states that the tendency of the Universe is to decay into chaos. I explain how this is to be understood in terms of information and why it does not contradict the biological preservation of information. Here I will also use information to present novel insights into the topics of global warming, environmentalism, and offer a new perspective on how to plan your diet.

Chapter 6 – Player 3: Economics. Having convinced you that biology and physics are all about information, I now claim that human behaviour too is based on the same information-theoretic principles. In particular, betting on random processes, such as in a casino or the stock market, is maximized when we follow these principles. Here we will see how to invest successfully by using laws of information.

Chapter 7 – Player 4: Sociology. More complex social structures, such as the distribution of cities, the wealth of citizens, and the social order are also seen through the eyes of an information theorist. This chapter is the culmination of the first part of the book, unifying a number of disparate phenomena through one and the same logic. Here I will discuss how to improve your social standing and how racial segregation can occur even within the most ardent group of xenophiles.

Chapter 8 – Player 5: Quantum Physics. In the second part of the book, I explain that the information in the real world is of a different kind from what it appears to be at first sight. Though still quantified in terms of bits, information is actually far more powerful than what we thought possible. This is because the world is ultimately quantum mechanical. This chapter explains the basics of quantum information which has some bizarre and rather radical features. We will see how to communicate so securely that even the CIA has no chance of eavesdropping on our conversations.

Chapter 9 – Player 6: Computer Science. This new form of information, based on quantum theory, can be used to compute faster than anything we have seen so far with our PCs (which are in the commonly accepted language of classical computers). Here I explain how hacking into your bank account will only take a few seconds with a quantum computer and how biological systems may already be capable of some simple forms of quantum computation.

Chapter 10 – Player 7: Philosophy. If the Universe has quantum information at its core – which is what I start to argue here – then we revisit the age-old problem of determinism versus free will. Can we act out of our own accord, or are all our actions predetermined? Here I will try to convince you that randomness and determinism do not oppose each other. I present an example of where they work hand in hand to teleport objects across the Universe.

Of course, some purists might argue that there is really only one player in Nature, and that player is physics itself. From the cards that physics reveals, the hands of all the other players follow. However, in this book I am arguing that it is the cards that are the most fundamental part of this game. Hence each of the players should be treated equally even though there may be some repetition in their messages, e.g. some of what economics reveals to us about human nature has already been captured by biology.

Once we conclude our analysis we then begin to synthesize these messages in Chapters 11 and 12. The result of this synthesis will be a reality, encoded through bits of information. Here we will view the Universe as a big quantum computer, running the biggest possible computer game to generate our reality. The programmers are the players in Calvino's card game and their software summarizes everything they've learnt from playing the game. Using the same logic, we can calculate the amount of information that can be stored inside any object, even the human brain.

Part Three of the book will also argue that information is the only appropriate entity on which to base the ultimate theory of everything. Not only does information present a framework in which gravity can be seen as a mere consequence of quantum theory (integrating quantum theory and gravity is the greatest challenge of modern physics), but it suggests how information can give rise to the ‘law without law‘ and thereby cut the Gordian knot of creation ex nihilo.

Some aspects presented in the final chapters will be speculative or still under discussion in the scientific community, and I will warn the reader when this is the case. However, whilst some of these aspects may turn out to be wrong, I hope that the reader will enjoy the intellectual journey. On this let me finish by quoting the famous eleventh-century Persian poet and astronomer, Omar Khayyam:

Those who conquered all science and letters,

And shone as beacons among their betters,

Did not find the thread of this Tangled Heap,

Only told a story, then they fell asleep.

四季皆宜的信息

假设你迟到来到一个派对。所有人都已经围坐在一张大圆桌旁。主人只是简单地邀请你入座，没有做任何解释。由于你平时很喜欢打扑克，想到能够参与其中让你感到兴奋，但你很快就发现这并不是在玩扑克牌。这时你才意识到自己完全不知道眼前发生的是什么。你想回头询问主人，却发现他已经不见了。为了避免显得太过生疏，你决定保持安静，继续观察场上的情况。

你最先注意到的是所有人都在无声地进行这个活动，这让你无法判断这到底是不是一个游戏。虽然这看起来有些古怪，但你猜想这可能是规则的一部分，于是决定继续观察。你发现玩家们使用的是一副类似塔罗牌的卡牌，每张牌上都绘制着独特的场景，比如一位战士正在击杀狮子，或是一位女士手持两把交叉的剑。随着时间推移，你看到玩家们轮流展示一组牌，每次出一张。当新的一张牌被放在前一张旁边时，其他玩家会专注地观察这张牌的内容，同时也会留意出牌者的肢体语言，试图更深入地理解这张牌所要传达的含义。

轮到你旁边的玩家出牌了。他放下的这张牌上画着一位国王，高举着宝剑，脚下是一头死去的狮子。你不禁猜想：「他是在讲述某个特定国王猎杀狮子的故事吗？」，「这是在暗指王权吗？」，还是说「这张牌象征着某种个人的胜利？」。就在你思索这些含义时，第二张牌被放了下来 —— 一条红龙。起初你以为这暗示着某种危机，但当你将两张牌联系起来看时，你推测它们可能代表着一位威尔士国王（红龙是威尔士的国家标志），或是一个正在面对危险的权势人物。随后又出现了三张牌：交叉的双剑、流动的河水，最后是一名乞丐。

此时此刻，你已经看出他们是在通过这些牌面和身体动作来进行某种信息交流。同样显而易见的是，在见识到足够多的牌之前，你很难真正理解这个游戏的内涵。但你开始思考一些问题：他们究竟想表达什么？他们是在讲述自己的人生故事，还是在为彼此创作娱乐性的故事，又或者每种牌的组合都有特定的分值？如果这是一场游戏，胜利的条件是什么？如果不是游戏，那它的意义又在哪里？

这个富有创意的故事出自著名意大利小说家 Italo Calvino 之手。在他的故事中，每个玩家都在试图向他人讲述自己的人生，但只能依靠牌面上的图像，辅以一些巧妙的手势和表情来表达。

在他的书中，Calvino 将这个纸牌游戏作为理解生活的重要隐喻。那么，他为什么要这样做呢？作为一名科学家，我难以准确揣测作者的真实用意。作家是艺术家，他们作品的价值往往在于其包含的多重含义，同一件艺术作品可能会被不同的人解读出不同的意义。我是一名科学家（而 Calvino 的父母恰好也是科学家），在我看来，Calvino 的纸牌游戏所展现的认知方式与我们理解现实的过程惊人地相似。

Calvino 的纸牌游戏可以类比为我们与自然界的对话，也就是与整个宇宙的互动。围坐在桌边的每位玩家都代表着自然界的某个层面，而你则扮演着观察者的角色。举例来说，其中一位玩家可能代表经济学，另一位代表物理学，还有人可能代表生物学或社会学。随着时间推移，每位玩家都会逐步揭示他们各自领域的规律和行为特征。自然界虽然无声，但会通过各种事件和环境变化来表达其意图。毫不意外，自然界用来交流的语言就是「信息」。这个纸牌游戏说明信息是以离散化的方式呈现的，就像一次只能出一张牌。这张牌是不可再分的。因此，Calvino 隐喻的第一层含义就是：存在着一种普遍适用的信息基本单位。在科学领域中，我们称这些基本单位为「比特」（bits）或二进制数字。我们将在第 3 章中深入探讨这些「比特」。

Calvino 故事的第二层含义是：即使一组牌的信息看似明确，它最终仍需要观察者（在这个故事中指你和其他玩家）的解读。这种解读可能与出牌者想要表达的意思相符，也可能大相径庭。不同的观察者可能会有完全不同的理解，甚至同一个观察者也可能对所见的内容产生多种不同的解读。这与我们在观察自然现象时遇到的本质不确定性十分相似，不同的人往往会得出截然不同的结论。

有趣的是，当轮到你出牌时，你就从观察者转变为了玩家，而自然则成为了观察者。当你放下手中的牌时，这种互动实际上影响着自然本身。这揭示了一个重要的双重性 —— 你无法仅仅作为旁观者参与其中而不对游戏产生影响。这就是 Calvino 故事的第三层含义：在现实生活中，我们同时扮演着观察者和参与者的角色。

Calvino 故事的第四层含义是：同一张牌在不同组合中可能传达出不同的信息。每张牌都具有其内在的不确定性，这种不确定性不依赖于观察者。比如，那张红龙牌可能象征着危险，可能代表恐惧，也可能暗示威尔士这个国家，具体含义取决于与它同时出现的其他牌。只有当整组牌全部呈现出来后，每张牌在特定语境中的含义才会变得清晰。因此，结合 Calvino 的第二点和第四点，我们可以看到这些牌不仅是信息的载体（比特），其含义还取决于解释者以及它们所处的组合关系。这意味着我们不能孤立地理解任何一张牌 —— 必须将它放在整个牌组序列中来理解。在科学中，这种特性被称为「语境性」（contextuality）。

这种语境性带来的一个最重要启示是：我们永远无法完全确定我们对自然的理解。因为下一条信息可能会推翻我们之前的认知，彻底改变整个信息的含义。在科学研究中，我们可能观察到一千个支持某个理论的实验结果，但仅仅一个后续实验就可能完全推翻这个理论，表明我们对自然传达的信息理解完全错误。同样在 Calvino 的故事中，在最后一张牌放到桌上之前，你无法确定故事的真正含义。最后一张牌可能会颠覆整个故事的主题。这让我们联想到古希腊哲学家苏格拉底的一句话：「在一个人去世之前，不要断言他是幸福的。」你可能在人生的大部分时间里都感到幸福，但在生命的最后一刻之前，你永远无法确定自己是否真的拥有了幸福的人生。我们将会看到，整个科学知识体系也是建立在这种看似残酷的逻辑之上。

如果我们进一步思考 Calvino 的这个游戏，会发现它与人类观察自然的过程有许多相似之处。就像故事中的观察者一样，人类在这场「游戏」中也是后来者。假如将这场游戏比作生命历程，如果说游戏已经进行了 10 年，那么人类也不过是在几分钟前才加入。而自然界中的某些基本规律，比如物理定律，从一开始就存在于这个世界上。因此，在我们试图构建对现实认知的过程中，已经有大量的信息在我们到来之前就已经传递出去了。

在 Calvino 的故事中，他直接呈现了这些玩家的存在。虽然场景已经设定，但他并未解释游戏为何开始，也没说明是谁邀请了这些玩家。他刻意让这些问题保持悬而未决，就如同现实世界中的情况一样。这引发了一个深层次的问题：这些玩家从何而来？这个问题最终指向了一个更根本的难题：存在的起源。

显然，理解现实的复杂程度远超过 Calvino 这样的故事所能描绘的范围。这个故事并未提供任何具体细节或指导，来说明我们应该如何衡量信息并将其应用到特定情况中，更不用说理解整个宇宙了。比如，一组塔罗牌的排列并不能让我们得出唯一的解释。那么，我们该如何判断哪个解释更合理呢？或者说，我们是否应该避免选择单一的解释，而是将所有可能的解释整合成一个更全面的理解体系？

如果我们将 Calvino 的故事看作自然界展示信息方式的参照，那么故事中还缺少一个关键特征：在 Calvino 的故事里，每张牌一旦放下就固定不变了。每张牌都有其特定的内容（即牌面图案），虽然这个内容可能有不同的解读，但牌面本身是不会改变的。例如，一张画着红龙的牌不会在抽出下一张牌时，或者被人观察时突然变成另一张牌。这种描述虽然看似不符合常理，但当我们在本书第二部分讨论物理学对现实的最佳描述 —— 量子理论时，就会发现这种牌与牌之间、以及牌与玩家之间缺少互动的现象，实际上具有重要的启示意义。

读到这里的读者可能对「信息」这个概念已经有了一些初步的认识。在日常交谈中，信息常常被等同于知识。我们往往认为，当我们能够就某个话题侃侃而谈，且没有人提出异议时，就表示我们掌握了这方面的知识。然而，这种通常意义上的「知识渊博」，与科学家眼中的知识有着本质的区别。在科学家看来，真正的知识都是关于未来的认知。正因如此，历史学家并不是科学家 —— 他们是在对过去进行推测，而科学则致力于预测未来。量子理论的开创者之一尼尔斯·玻尔（Neils Bohr）曾经打趣道：「预测是一件困难的事，尤其是预测未来。」

试图预见未来总是伴随着风险。当我们尝试预测未来时，不可避免地需要进行一些推测性的思考，这或者是因为未来本身充满不确定性，或者是因为我们掌握的信息不够充分。这种不确定性在 Calvino 的故事中已有体现：在最后一张牌放上桌之前，我们无法确定故事的真正含义。最后一张牌可能会完全改变整个故事的主旨。与 Calvino 故事中有限的牌组不同，自然界似乎在不断地展示新的「牌」。这就意味着，随着越来越多的现象被揭示，我们不得不不断推测自然想要传达的信息。因此，我们的理解可能会被后续发现的证据推翻，但这种风险正是科学探索过程中不可或缺的组成部分。

举例来说，当物理学家研究原子时，会先通过理论计算来预测其特性，在现代通常是借助计算机来完成这项工作。接着，他们会在实验室中进行实际测量（现在的研究中，理论计算和实验测量通常由不同的研究人员完成，但也不是绝对如此）。最后，物理学家会将实验测量结果与理论预测进行对比，如果两者在误差范围内相符，就可以认为他们对该现象有了正确的理解。如果实验结果与理论预测存在矛盾 —— 且确认不是由实验误差导致的 —— 那么这个理论，也就是我们对自然界传达信息的解读，就必须进行修正。

这就是科学方法的核心，正是这种方法帮助人类在短短 400 年间深入理解了自然界的诸多奥秘。这种方法也可以说是现代文明最重要的标志之一。

尽管我们至此一直在探讨宇宙中信息存在的原因，以及自然界如何向我们传达信息这些问题，但我们的终极目标是展示信息如何构建我们所观察到的现实世界。我们将遵循罗杰·培根（Roger Bacon）提出的「分析与综合」原则，先对现实世界的各个基本要素进行独立分析，然后将它们整合成一个完整的理论体系。

现实世界的每个基本领域（对应 Calvino 故事中的玩家）都将从其如何包含和传递信息的角度进行分析。虽然我会从信息科学的视角来阐述这些领域的内容，但这些内容都是经过科学界公认的。读者可能不会完全认同我最终关于现实本质的观点，但我希望这些独立领域的讨论本身能够为读者带来启发。

以下是我们将要探讨的主要领域：

第 4 章 —— 玩家 1：生物学。信息理论在生物学领域获得了其首次重要应用，遗传学的整个发展过程都围绕着信息的保存和传递展开。在这个领域中，信息的概念最容易理解，并且具有明确的定义。生物信息以其稳定性而著称，但其背后的基本原理具有普遍性。我们可以借鉴这些原理来建立一个全新的企业经营框架。

第 5 章 —— 玩家 2：热力学。物理学与信息之间有着悠久的渊源，我将以此为基础讨论著名的热力学第二定律。该定律指出宇宙有向混沌状态演化的趋势。我将从信息的角度解释这一现象，并说明为什么这与生物学中的信息保存并不矛盾。在这一章中，我还将运用信息理论来探讨全球变暖、环境保护等问题，并为制定饮食计划提供新的思路。

第 6 章 —— 玩家 3：经济学。在论证了生物学和物理学的本质都是关于信息之后，我将进一步指出人类行为也遵循着相同的信息论原理。特别是在涉及赌场或股票市场等随机过程的决策时，遵循这些原理能够获得最优结果。在这一章中，我们将学习如何运用信息理论的原则来进行成功的投资。

第 7 章 —— 玩家 4：社会学。一些更加复杂的社会现象，例如城市规模的分布、财富的分配以及社会秩序的形成，都可以通过信息理论的视角来解析。本章作为本书第一部分的核心内容，将用统一的逻辑来解释这些看似毫不相关的现象。在这里，我们将探讨如何提升个人的社会影响力，以及为什么即使在最推崇多元文化的群体中，也可能出现种族隔离现象。

第 8 章 —— 玩家 5：量子物理学。在本书的第二部分，我将解释为什么现实世界中的信息与表面上看起来完全不同。虽然我们仍然用比特（bits）来度量信息，但信息的实际能力远超我们的想象。这是因为我们的世界从根本上遵循量子力学原理。本章将介绍量子信息的基本概念，这种信息具有一些令人惊讶的独特特性。我们将了解如何实现绝对安全的通信方式，即使是最先进的情报机构也无法破解。

第 9 章 —— 玩家 6：计算机科学。这种基于量子理论的新型信息形式，能够实现比传统计算机（即我们常用的基于经典计算理论的个人电脑）快得多的运算速度。本章将讨论量子计算机的强大能力，它可以在几秒钟内破解传统的银行加密系统，同时我们还会探讨生物系统可能已经在进行某些简单形式的量子计算。

第 10 章 —— 玩家 7：哲学。如果我们认为量子信息是宇宙的本质 —— 这也是我将在本章开始论证的观点 —— 那么我们就需要重新思考决定论与自由意志这个古老的哲学难题。我们是否真的拥有按照自己意愿行动的能力，还是说我们的每一个行为都是命运预设的？在这一章中，我将阐释为什么随机性和决定论并非对立的概念。我会通过一个特殊的例子来说明它们如何共同作用，使得物质在宇宙中实现瞬间传送。

有些严格的理论家可能会认为，自然界实际上只有一个根本的玩家，那就是物理学。其他所有领域的规律都是从物理学的基本法则衍生出来的。然而，在本书中，我主张最基础的是信息本身，也就是这个游戏中的「牌」。因此，尽管不同领域之间可能存在一些信息的重叠（比如经济学中关于人性的某些发现可能已经在生物学中有所体现），但我们仍然应该平等地对待每个领域。

完成了这些分析之后，我们将在第 11 章和第 12 章进行理论综合。这种综合将展示一个由信息比特构建的现实世界。在这个视角下，我们可以将整个宇宙想象为一台巨型量子计算机，它在运行着一个最宏大的程序来生成我们的现实。Calvino 纸牌游戏中的玩家就像是这个程序的设计者，他们的「代码」包含了他们在游戏中获得的所有洞见。运用同样的理论框架，我们还可以计算任何物体（包括人类大脑）所能容纳的理论信息容量。

本书的第三部分将进一步论证为什么信息是构建终极理论的最佳基础。信息理论不仅提供了一个新的视角，使我们能够将重力理解为量子理论的自然推论（要知道，统一量子理论和重力理论是当代物理学面临的最大挑战），而且还揭示了信息如何产生一种「超越规律的规律」，从而为宇宙起源这个难解之谜提供新的思路。

在本书的最后几章中，有些观点仍属于探索性质，或者正在科学界进行讨论，我会在这些地方特别说明。尽管其中一些观点可能最终被证明是不正确的，但我希望读者能在这场探索真理的旅程中获得启发。在此，让我引用 11 世纪波斯著名诗人和天文学家奥马尔·海亚姆（Omar Khayyam）的诗句作为结语：

穷尽科学文字的智者们，

如明灯照亮后人的前路，

却未能解开混沌的谜题，

留下故事一篇，长眠不醒。

### Key points

Calvino's card game forms an effective metaphor for the way that we observe and understand reality.

Information is the language Nature uses to convey its messages and this information comes in discrete units. We use these units to construct our reality.

The main players in Calvino's card game represent different aspects of Nature. I have chosen these players to be biology, thermodynamics, economics, sociology, quantum physics, computer science and philosophy.

Key messages from each of these players will be analysed in an information-centric manner in the chapters to come.

Synthesis of the key messages from each player will result in our view of how reality is generated or encoded.

核心要点：

Calvino 的纸牌游戏巧妙地比喻了人类认知和理解现实的过程。

信息是自然界用来传递讯息的基本语言，这种信息以离散单位的形式存在。我们正是通过这些基本单位来构建对现实的认知。

Calvino 纸牌游戏中的主要玩家象征着自然界的不同领域。在本书中，这些领域包括生物学、热力学、经济学、社会学、量子物理学、计算机科学和哲学。

我们将从信息科学的视角来分析每个领域的核心原理。

通过整合这些领域的核心原理，我们将形成一个关于现实本质的全新认识。
