## 0701Social Informatics: Get Connected or Die Tryin

Everybody knows a Joe. Joe is the kind of guy who was the most popular boy in class, head boy at school, the life and soul of the party, and whenever he needs something, it just seems to happen for him. This is the guy we love to hate! Why is he getting all the breaks when we have to work so damn hard? As we continue to grind out each day at work, we see Joe is the guy with a big house, fast car, and the most beautiful women swooning over him. Most men would give their right arm to have a bit of that magic.

So, how does he do it? Of course, I cannot tell you for sure (if I could my next book would be a bestselling self-help book), but it should come as no surprise that people with more friends and contacts tend to be more successful than people with fewer. Intuitively, we know that these people, by virtue of their wide range of contacts, seem to have more support and opportunity to make the choices they want.

Likewise, again it's no surprise that more interconnected societies tend to be able to cope better with challenging events than ones where people are segregated or isolated. Initially it seems unlikely that this connectedness has anything to do with Shannon's information theory; after all what does sending a message down a telephone line have to do with how societies function or respond to events?

The first substantial clue that information may play some role in sociology came in 1971 from the American economist and Nobel Laureate, Thomas Schelling. Up until his time sociology was a highly qualitative subject (and still predominantly is); however he showed how certain social paradigms could be approached in the same rigorous quantitative manner as other processes where exchange of information is the key driver.

Schelling is an interesting character. He served with the Marshall Plan (the plan to help Europe recover after World War II), the White House, and the Executive Office of the President from 1948 to 1953, as well as holding a string of positions at illustrious academic institutions, including Yale and Harvard. Schelling is most famous for his work on conflicts between nation-states, particularly those with nuclear weapons. Here the central idea is that of ‘pre-commitment'. One party in a conflict can strengthen its strategic position by cutting off some of its options to make its threats more credible. For example, an army that burns its bridges, making retreat impossible, is a classic military example – here the opposition now knows you can no longer retreat and therefore its strategy is more limited. They know you are fighting until the end – a classic case of brinkmanship.

But Schelling went further. He realized that studying conflict can result in an understanding stretching far beyond military conflict. He applied a similar analysis to individuals' internal struggles. The problem, he suggested, is that pretty much everybody suffers from a split personality on various issues. For example, one side of you may desperately want to lose weight or quit smoking or run two miles a day or get up early to work. On the other hand, the other side may want an extra dessert or a cigarette, hate exercise, or love sleep. Both selves are equally valid, and equally rational about pursuing their desires. But they do not exist at the same time and which side wins depends on the strategies that the two personalities use. In Schelling's view, we could improve the chances of one side winning by showing a huge commitment which the other side would find difficult to match. So whilst the second side says I want to stay in bed a bit longer, the first side can retaliate with ‘but I am paying $70 a week for morning personal training sessions'. Gym memberships, not keeping cigarettes in the house, not having a car and walking to work instead, are all examples of what Shelling referred to as ‘burning your bridges'.

Studying conflict thus turned out to be important not only for the military, but also for individuals and, as we will see shortly, for understanding segregation in a society. And underlying it will, of course, be the concept of information.

The idea of using information theory in social studies is certainly not something new and we can trace its roots back way before Schelling. In fact, it is the use of statistical methods in social sciences that prompted Boltzmann to apply them within physics in order to come up with his entropy formula. Of course, a direct application of the statistical methods used in information theory is much more challenging given the complex nature of any human society (yes, human society is far more complex than any physical system), but it has the same underlying premise. When compared to a simple gas of atoms, which is a typical model in physics, every human being has added variability in that he or she can formulate an independent complex strategy in order to satisfy their own ends.

Information itself appears in many different guises in the social context: connections between individuals, actions, and states of individuals, capacity of societies to process data, and so on. All of these types of information play a role in the functioning of a society.

An important idea that we have alluded to in the previous chapters, but whose more precise introduction we have been delaying, is that of ‘mutual information'. This concept is very important in understanding a diverse number of phenomena in Nature and will be the key when we explain the origin of structure in any society.

Mutual information is the formal word used to describe the situation when two (or more) events share information about one another. Having mutual information between events means that they are no longer independent; one event has something to tell you about the other. For example, when someone asks if you'd like a drink in a bar, how many times have you replied ‘I'll have one if you have one'? This statement means that you are immediately correlating your actions with the actions of the person offering you a drink. If they have a drink, so will you; if they don't, neither will you. Your choice to drink-or-not-to-drink is completely tied to theirs and hence, in information theory parlance, you both have maximum mutual information.

A little more formally, the whole presence of mutual information can be phrased as an inference indicator. Two things have mutual information if by looking at just one of them you can infer something about one of the properties of the other one. So, in the above example, if I see that you have a drink in front of you that means logically that the person offering you a drink also has a glass in front of them (given that you only drink when the person next to you drinks).

Of course mutual information between events is not always perfect, it could also be imperfect, in that you ‘usually' but not always will have a drink if your friend has a drink. In this case any inference between the two of you will be weaker.

Whenever we discuss mutual information we are really asking how much information an object/person/idea has about another object/person/idea. In the telephone communication example, Alice and Bob share mutual information. After she has communicated to Bob, the two now share this same message. When Bob tells you what the message is, assuming maximum mutual information between Alice and Bob, you will then know what message Alice sent without having to ask Alice. In cases of non-maximal mutual information (e.g. Bob may have forgotten parts of it) we can only infer the message with partial success.

When it comes to DNA, its molecules share information about the protein they encode. Different strands of DNA share information about each other as well (we know that A only binds to G and C only binds to T). Furthermore the DNA molecules of different people also share information about one another (a father and a son, for example, share half of their DNA genetic material) and the DNA is itself sharing information with the environment – in that the environment determines through natural selection how the DNA evolves.

In thermodynamics, mutual information is established between the demon's memory and the movement of the particles. How much work the demon can extract is dependent on how much information the demon has on the actual speed of the particles. In financial strategies, the profit derived is inevitably linked to how much information you share with the market (random betting aside). If you want to know how the price of the stock will move, then you need to have complete information about the market (often virtually impossible given the complexity and volume of information). Given that everything interacts to some degree with everything else, mutual information is simply everywhere!

One of the phenomena we will try to understand here, using mutual information, is what we call ‘globalization', or the increasing interconnectedness of disparate societies. Another social phenomenon we will address is the division of every society into different classes and the related negative effects of segregation.

Before we delve further into social phenomena, I need to explain an important concept in physics called a phase transition. Stated somewhat loosely, phase transitions occur in a system when the information shared between the individual constituents become large (so for a gas in a box, for an iron rod in a magnetic field, and for a copper wire connected into an electric circuit, all their constituents share some degree of mutual information).

A high degree of mutual information often leads to a fundamentally different behaviour, although the individual constituents are still the same. To elaborate this point, the individual constituents are not affected on an individual basis, but as a group they exhibit entirely different behaviour. The key is how the individual constituents relate to one another and create a group dynamic. This is captured by the phrase ‘more is different', by the physicist Philip Anderson, who contributed a great deal to the subject, culminating in his Nobel Prize in 1977.

A common example of a group dynamic is the effect we observe when boiling or freezing water (i.e. conversion of a liquid to a gas or conversion of a liquid to a solid). These extreme and visible changes of structures and behaviour are known as phase transitions. When water freezes, the phase transition occurs as the water molecules becomes more tightly correlated and these correlations manifest themselves in stronger molecular bonds and a more solid structure.

The formation of societies and significant changes in every society – such as a revolution or a civil war or the attainment of democracy – can, in fact, be better understood using the language of phase transitions.

I now present one particular example that will explain phase transitions in more detail. This example will then act as our model to explain various social phenomena that we will tackle later in the chapter. Let us imagine a simple solid, made up of a myriad of atoms (billions and billions of them). Atoms usually interact with each other, although these interactions hardly ever stretch beyond their nearest neighbours. So, atoms next to each other will feel each other's presence only, while the ones that are further apart from each other will typically never directly exchange any information.

It would now be expected that as a result of the ‘nearest neighbour' interaction, only the atoms next to each other share information while this is not possible where there is no interaction. Though this may sound logical, it is in fact entirely incorrect. Think of a whip: you shake one end and this directly influences the speed and range at which the other end moves. You are transferring movement using the interconnectedness of atoms in the whip. Information can be shared between distant atoms because one atom interacts with its neighbours, but the neighbours also interact with their neighbours, and so on. This concept can be explained more elegantly through the concept of ‘six degrees of separation'.

You often see it claimed that each person on this planet is at most six people away from any other person. This sounds shocking at first but actually makes complete sense if you look at it in detail. I am, for example, just three degrees of separation (three people) away from Bill Clinton. How's this? Well, I know a guy quite well who works in the City of London. His boss knows the boss of the American branch of the bank and the American boss knows Bill Clinton. So there we go! So if you count the number of people separating Bill Clinton and me you will see that there are only three. Though I may be particularly indifferent to the fact that I am separated from former President Clinton only by three degrees (he surely is), it is nevertheless interesting that this is so. It is also interesting that this is how connections work. It doesn't matter whether you know a person doing X, all that matters is that you are connected into society, because, through this, you have access to almost everybody on the planet (and somebody somewhere should know something about X).

It is very easy to see why any one person is connected to any other with at most six degrees of separation. Say that I know roughly 100 people (probably more, but it is said that 200 is the capacity for the human brain to differentiate and memorize different names and faces – this is our evolutionary inheritance for the early days of human evolution, where time was spent in small tribes). Each of the 100 people I know knows 100 more people, and so on. After five steps this number reaches ten billion (100 times 100 times 100 times 100 times 100, five times). The number of people in the world is six billion. So, even five steps of connections and acquaintances are enough in this model to connect everyone to everyone else on this planet. But, of course, maybe not everyone knows 100 people, and so on, which leads to perhaps needing six degrees to make a network that covers everyone in the world. Perhaps this is why in society we gravitate to more connected people, to optimize our interconnectedness.

Why is this networking between people important? You might argue that decisions made by society are to a high degree controlled by individuals – who ultimately think for themselves. It is clear, however, that this thinking is based on the common information shared between individuals. It is this interaction between individuals that is responsible for the different structures within society as well as society itself.

Societies can, in addition, have a certain number of other features, such as a degree of centralization in their decision making. One extreme form of centralization is dictatorship, and it is not very interesting to analyse as individuals have less of a role in any decision making (by definition). The other extreme is much more interesting, and this means that there is no centralization and where individuals line up of their own accord. Here we would like the consensus to emerge just by individuals interacting with one another – no external stimulus is allowed. In this case, the information shared between individuals becomes much more important. So how do all people agree to make a decision, if they only interact locally, i.e. with a very limited number of neighbours?

In order to understand how local correlations can lead to the establishment of structures within society, let us return to the example of a solid. Solids are regular arrays of atoms. This time, however, rather than talking about how water becomes ice, let's consider how a solid becomes a magnet. Every atom in a solid can be thought of as a little magnet on its own. Initially these magnets are completely independent of one another and there is no common north/south alignment – meaning that they are all pointing in random directions. The whole solid – the whole collection of atoms – would then be a random collection of magnets and would not be magnetized as a whole (this is known as a paramagnet). All the random little atomic magnets would simply cancel each other out in effect and there would be no net magnetic field.

However, if the atoms interact, then they can affect each other's state, i.e. they can cause their neighbours to line up with them. Now through the same principle as six degrees of separation, each atom affects the other atoms it is connected to, and in turn these affect their own neighbours, eventually correlating all the atoms in the solid. If the interaction is stronger than the noise due to the external temperature, then all magnets will eventually align in the same direction and the solid as a whole generates a net magnetic field and hence becomes magnetic! All atoms now behave coherently in tune, just like one big magnet. The point at which all atoms ‘spontaneously' align is known as the point of phase transition, i.e. the point at which a solid becomes a magnet.

Can this simple idea be applied to something as complicated as human society? Initially, this seems like it may be very difficult. We would like to think of humans as little magnets (let's say that they can ‘politically' point in the left or right direction) and we now investigate under what circumstances whole societies can swing to the left or to the right and how this requires very little external influence. This would be the social analogue of the magnetic phase transition.

You may object that atoms are simple systems compared to humans. After all humans can think, feel, get angry, while atoms are not alive and their range of behaviour is far simpler. But this is not the point! The point is that we are only focusing on one relevant property of humans (or atoms) here. Atoms are not all that simple either, but we are choosing to make them so by looking only at their magnetic properties. Humans are much more complicated still, but now we only want to know about their political preference, and these can be quite simple in practice.

Let us discuss this aspect a bit more. Surely there is a crucial difference between atoms and humans. Namely, humans have free will. They are autonomous and make their own decisions, create their own destinies. Atoms are incapable of this. While this discussion of free will is a very intricate one, and we will debate it later, there is something that could already be said on it here.

Suppose for that matter that you observe satellite pictures of people walking up and down a busy street, such as Oxford Street in London. You will not be able to make out who the individuals are – that is if you use the google.com satellite pictures (I am sure that CIA or MOSSAD can easily accomplish a better resolution). People will appear as dots moving between two straight lines – the edges of the pavement of Oxford Street. There will be some larger dots in the middle representing the traffic, which we will ignore for the time being.

You now observe how the dots move. They will broadly move up and down the street, but there will be a certain movement to the left and to the right too, as the dots avoid each other. Imagine now that someone shows you this picture of dots moving in this fashion, but does not tell you that they represent people. Would you be able to tell, just from the motion of the dots, whether they represent something living (even intelligent?) from something non-living (such as atoms, or billiard balls hitting each other and bouncing off in different directions)?

Most likely you wouldn't be able to tell the difference, as the motion of people or atoms would be roughly the same (in their own ways they both avoid collisions, either via seeing and moving or via electrostatic repulsion). Both would be known as a diffusion process – a general overall flow in one direction (up and down), but with some random irregularities every once in a while. And this is precisely my point, that living and non-living things appear to behave in a very similar manner.

We now return to the issue of phase transitions and human societies. Suppose that we have a chain of systems where each system only interacts with its two neighbours. Such a system was first considered in physics by Ernest Ising, who studied it during his PhD in the 1920s. Unfortunately, he was able to prove very conclusively that there is no phase transition in such a model. So, if you think of atoms in such a chain as being little magnets, then they can never ever spontaneously align with each other no matter what happens outside. This was apparently such a disappointing conclusion to Ising, who was hoping to explain phase transitions microscopically, that he quit physics after his PhD!

Too bad for Ising, because some 20 years later Lars Onsager showed in a very beautiful paper that if instead of a chain you look at a two-dimensional array of atoms, then there is a phase transition at low enough temperatures. And for this, Onsager was awarded a Nobel Prize for chemistry. The whole area of phase transitions then started to thrive, resulting in a number of fundamental discoveries and Nobel Prizes (Anderson's included).

Among one of the most striking results in phase transitions that I am aware of is a very general ‘no-go' theorem. No-go theorems are broad results that rule out some specific kind of behaviour. Ising's result is a special kind of no-go theorem that says that there are no phase transitions in one dimension (chains). Interestingly, it can be shown that there are no general phase transitions in two dimensions (planes) either. The only exception to this no-go in the two-dimensional case is the model that Onsager analysed (so he was very lucky after all!). The very fact that we see ice turn into water and water into vapour already implies that the Universe has to be at least three-dimensional.

Anyway, what has all this to do with human societies? You can think of atoms in the above systems, not as little magnets, but as human beings! Yes, as commented above, we are more complicated than atoms, but some of our features are very simple. Think of a human being and his political predispositions. Suppose that we have two choices in a society, to be conservative or to be liberal. These two states would be the human analogue of a magnet with two states: pointing to the right, or pointing to the left (I am fully aware that some cynics might say that ‘in power' or ‘out of power' are more important directions in politics).

Now, in general, a society will be in a state such that some members are conservative and some liberal. But suppose that we ask under what conditions would all members become, say, liberal? Our discussion of Ising's result would suggest that if we have a very simple society where every member discusses politics only with their two nearest neighbours (and no one else), then there is no way that we can have a fully liberal society. We can never have a spontaneous liberalization and we are always forced to live with some conservatives!

A one-dimensional society is therefore very easy to describe and there are no surprising changes here. One such society is the mafia depicted in the movie Goodfellas (this is indeed far from being liberal). The main boss of the mafia, the capo di tutti capi, is a guy called Pauly, who would only communicate his orders to his two closest men – he would rarely talk to anyone else. They would then in turn communicate to their closest allies, and so on. This is not only secure so far as it prevents the FBI from finding the key people in the mafia, but it also leads to an increased stability within the mafia itself. It is therefore very unlikely that the mafia as a whole will suddenly undergo a phase transition and change its behaviour significantly, for example, electing a new leader or breaking down due to a few rogue informants.

Interestingly, if we allow everyone to interact with everyone else, then even in one dimension phase transitions are possible. Now, the real world is somewhere between these two extremes. None of us really speaks only to our neighbours, and no-one certainly communicates to everyone in the world. As I said above, our circle of family, friends, and acquaintances to which we are sufficiently connected usually extends to roughly 200 people.

In fact, the number of connections we have with other humans follows what is known as a power law distribution. The number of people who know lots of other people is smaller than the number of people who know few. And the ratio of the two numbers follows a strict law, similar to the Zipf law of letter frequencies mentioned earlier in the book. More precisely, there are a million times fewer people with 1000 contacts than with 10 contacts. People with lots of connections are just statistically improbable in the same way that longer words are less likely to be heard in English.

This unevenness in the number of contacts leads to a very important model where there is a great deal of interaction with people close by and then, every once in a while, there is a long-distance interaction with someone far away. This is called a ‘small world network' and is an excellent model for how and why disease propagates rapidly in our world. When we get ill, disease usually spreads quickly to our closest neighbours. Then it is enough that only one of the neighbours takes a long-distance flight and this can then make the virus spread in distant places. And this is why we are very worried about swine flu and all sorts of other potential viruses that can kill humans.

Let us now consider why some people believe – rightly or wrongly – that the information revolution has and will transform our society more than any other revolution in the past – such as the industrial revolution discussed in earlier chapters. Some sociologists, such as Manuel Castells, believe that the Internet will inflict much more profound transformations in our society than ever previously seen in history. His logic is based on the above idea of phase transitions, though, being a sociologist, he may not be interpreting them in quite the same way as a physicist does mathematically.

To explain, we can think of early societies as very ‘local' in nature. One tribe exists here, another over there, but with very little communication between them. Even towards the end of the nineteenth century, transfer of ideas and communication in general were still very slow. So for a long time humans have lived in societies where communication was very short range. And, in physics, this would mean that abrupt changes are impossible. Societies have other complexities, so I would say that ‘fundamental change is unlikely' rather than ‘impossible'. Very recently, through the increasing availability of technology we can travel far and wide, and through the Internet we can learn from and communicate with virtually anyone in the world.

Early societies were like the Ising model, while later ones are more like the small world networks. Increasingly, however, we are approaching the stage where everyone can and does interact with everyone else. And this is exactly when phase transitions become increasingly more likely. Money (and even labour) can travel from one end of the globe to another in a matter of seconds or even faster. This, of course, has an effect on all elements of our society.

Analysing social structures in terms of information theory can frequently reveal very counterintuitive features. This is why it is important to be familiar with a language of information theory, because without a formalized framework, some of the most startling and beautiful effects are much harder to understand in terms of root causes. Take segregation in a modern society, for example. Modern-day Los Angeles has distinct areas with clearly defined boundaries for white, Hispanic and black Americans. It is clear that this segregation is not legally imposed from above (each person is legally free to buy a property in any area they wish to) so is the inescapable conclusion that they are all a bunch of racists? The surprising answer, according to Schelling, is no, and that even the most liberal minded communities could end up transitioning into a segregated state. Segregation in this sense occurs very much like the phase transition we discussed earlier.

To simulate segregation, Schelling used a very simple model analogous to the phase transition model of a magnet described before. Imagine a two-dimensional grid, on which you can lay black and white pieces randomly. If we take this as synonymous with communities, this corresponds to a very liberal and mixed community (in the magnet example, this corresponds to a completely disordered state, where all the little magnets are aligned in all different directions).

Now we have to study the dynamics and see how segregation emerges. Schelling looked at the following rule: each and every piece looks around at its neighbours and if it sees a certain number of neighbours of different colour, it makes a decision to move somewhere else. It's clear that an extreme racist attitude is going to lead to segregation (e.g. if every piece moved just because one of its neighbours were of a different colour). However, and this is the surprise Schelling presented, it appears that even if you take a very liberal view, and move only when all your neighbours are of a different colour, this still leads us naturally to a segregated society. What this means in the Ising model is that even the weakest interaction is enough to make it undergo a phase transition. In such a model, interactions would force two spins to align themselves in the same way that in Schelling's model neighbours become racially homogeneous (to remind the reader, a city is analogous to a two-dimensional structure and in two dimensions, unlike in one dimension, the Ising model exhibits phase transitions).

The most natural way of thinking about this is in terms of mutual information. In the initial state, which was completely disordered, there was very little mutual information – because by looking at one piece, it is difficult to infer the colour of the neighbours (as by definition, the pieces are laid out in a disordered manner). However the mutual information is maximal in a maximally segregated society, as you can look at one piece and you can then infer the colour of all the pieces surrounding it. As with other phase transitions we have talked about, here mutual information is also a signature of a segregated society (a segregated society would represent an ordered state of magnets, when they all behave collectively).

If you properly understand Schelling's simple model, then you will quickly see that this doesn't have to apply to just racial segregation. It could also apply to any other grouping in a society. Political, financial, social, intellectual separations can all be studied and understood using the same logic.

We have been grossly simplifying societies here, but our analysis certainly contains some elements of truth. To see how much truth, let us test our predictive power on a very simple question. What is the distribution of wealth in a typical society? This question combines the gambling elements we discussed in the previous chapter with social elements we are discussing now.

If the basis of every society is information, as I have been arguing, does optimizing information tell us about the wealth distribution within a society? The answer is both yes and no. Let me explain the no first.

When we optimize the Shannon information we typically obtain a distribution of probabilities that is called Gaussian or bell curve. This distribution is named after the German mathematician Karl Friedrich Gauss, who first noticed the ubiquity of Gaussian distributions in Nature. For example, atoms in a gas distribute their speeds according to a Gaussian distribution. Most atoms move at some middle-range speed (say 500 metres per second). Then equally smaller numbers move at around 400 and 600 meters per second. The number of atoms that we record as we move away from 500 metres per second diminishes very quickly. And this is the main feature of Gaussians, which have a typical bell-shaped profile.

The distribution of wealth in most societies is not Gaussian. It is in fact a power law. This means that the number of very wealthy individuals is very small, whereas the number of poor is huge. If wealth followed a Gaussian distribution, then most people would be somewhere in the middle with small deviations to the richer and poorer side of the spectrum. This, alas, is never ever the case in any society we are aware of (not even in totalitarian communist regimes of the past such as the Soviet Union).

Where does the power law distribution come from? Why is the probability of having one million dollars in your bank account 1000 times smaller than having $1000? This is exactly what the power law says. If there are 100 millionaires in a country, then there are 100,000 people with only $1000.

Let us try to see why this is so. The complete answer is not known, but we can make some guesses (if I knew the answer I would probably immediately book myself a plane ticket to Stockholm to pick up a Noble Prize in economics). The favoured explanation seems to be a principle that can be called ‘the-rich-get-richer'. In simple terms, wealth doesn't just add to wealth, it multiplies. Those that have more will get proportionally more and so the gap between the haves and have-nots increases to conform to the power law. Even if everyone starts equally well off, the small random differences in people's fortunes (some will win on the random stock market, others will lose) will sooner or later grow to become large.

Does this mean that information has nothing to do with wealth distribution? No. People acquire wealth not only by themselves, but through a set of networks that they create using all sorts of social mechanisms. Social interactions are complicated and go on in parallel in all corners of any given society. The social dynamic is very intricate and changes on very short time-scales.

This means that we expect information not to have the additive property, namely that the joint information contained in two independent events must be equal to the sum of the information content of each individual event (this was used in Chapter 3 to derive Shannon's entropy). If additivity fails, the correct measure of information is no longer Shannon's. One person who studied these non-additive measures extensively is a Brazilian physicist, Constantino Tsallis. Why is wealth not additive? As we have seen, having some wealth and gaining more does not just result in the sum of the two. Wealth does not just simply add, it super-adds! This is another view of the principle of increasing returns in economics (which we met in Chapter 6). There is no contradiction here, since wealth is not a conserved quantity. It can be created out of nothing (by nothing I mean ‘no initial wealth'; I do not mean without any physical resources).

If we use a different formula to Shannon's, but still an inverse function of probability, we can explain the power law distribution. Therefore, even one of the key aspects of social dynamics and stability – its wealth distribution – is an outcome of simple information theory. If not Shannon's in actual form, this surely is Shannon in spirit.

Some sociologists are optimistic that the information age will lead to a fairer society that will improve everyone's living conditions, as well as narrowing the gap between the haves and have-nots. Others are rather pessimistic, claiming that the new age will bring an abrupt end, a kind of phase transition, to present society (through all sorts of mechanisms such as increased crime due to the breakdown of families, global terrorism, global warming, and so on).

It is unlikely that information theory will tell us what the future has in store for us. One thing is for sure, though. With greater interconnectedness of the world, we had better improve the speed of our thinking and decision making. In a more interconnected society we are more susceptible to sudden changes. Mutual information simply increases very rapidly and if we want to make good decisions we need to ensure that our own information processing keeps pace. The future, it seems, will not only favour the brave but also the fastest.

Having seen how information underpins various social, biological, and physical phenomena, we are now ready to take the discussion to the next level. We travel back to the questions of where this information comes from, how much of it there is in the Universe and what is the fastest that it can be processed. The answers to these questions underpin all the chapters we have seen so far. In order to understand the ultimate origins of information we need to take an exciting voyage of discovery. And this will take us into the realms of quantum mechanics, the true nature of randomness, whether teleportation is possible, and the question of free will and determinism. It's going to be a rocky boat, so hold on tight!

社会信息学：社交人脉决定成败

人人都认识一个像 Joe 这样的人。他在班上最受欢迎，当过学生会主席，是派对上的开心果，而且每次他想要什么，事情总是自然而然就成了。这就是那种让人既羡慕又嫉妒的家伙！为什么他总能轻松得到机会，而我们却要拼命努力？当我们还在朝九晚五地打拼时，Joe 已经住上了大房子，开着豪车，身边还总是不缺美女环绕。换作其他人，恐怕都愿意豁出去，也想要这种好运气。

那么，他到底是怎么做到的？说实话，我也说不准（要是我知道，我的下一本书就该是畅销的成功学著作了），但有一点是显而易见的：拥有更多朋友和人脉的人，往往比交际圈子小的人更容易成功。从生活经验来看，这些人正是因为拥有广泛的人际网络，才能获得更多支持和选择的机会。

同样地，我们不难理解为什么社会联系更紧密的群体，相比那些人员分散或彼此孤立的群体，往往能更好地应对各种挑战。乍看之下，这种社会联系似乎与 Claude Shannon 的信息论毫无关系 —— 毕竟，通过电话线传递消息这样的通信行为，怎么会和社会运作方式或应对事件的能力有关联呢？

直到 1971 年，美国经济学家、诺贝尔奖得主 Thomas Schelling 提供了第一个重要线索，揭示了信息在社会学中可能扮演的角色。在他之前，社会学一直是一门主要依靠定性研究（qualitative research）的学科（时至今日依然如此）。但 Schelling 证明了，某些社会现象可以像研究其他以信息交换为核心的过程一样，用严谨的数学方法进行量化分析。

Schelling 是一位引人注目的人物。他曾参与马歇尔计划（二战后帮助欧洲复苏的计划），并在 1948 年至 1953 年期间在白宫和总统行政办公室任职，同时还在耶鲁大学和哈佛大学等多个著名学术机构担任要职。Schelling 最为人称道的是他对国家间冲突的研究，尤其是涉及核武器国家之间的冲突研究。其中的核心理念是「预先承诺」（pre-commitment）。冲突中的一方可以通过主动放弃某些选项来增强其战略地位，使其威胁更具说服力。这在军事上有一个经典案例：军队主动烧毁退路的桥梁，使撤退成为不可能。此时敌方意识到对手已无退路可走，其可选择的战略随之受限。这表明对手将不得不战斗到底 —— 这是一个典型的边缘战术（brinkmanship）范例。

但 Schelling 的研究并未止步于此。他发现对冲突的研究可以带来远超军事领域的深刻见解。他将这种分析方法运用到了人们内心的矛盾冲突中。他指出，问题的关键在于，几乎每个人在面对各种事情时都会出现内心的双重倾向。比如说，你内心的一部分可能极度渴望减肥、戒烟、坚持每天跑两英里或早起工作。而同时，另一部分却想着要多吃一份甜点、来根香烟、对运动避之不及，或者贪恋睡眠。这两种倾向都是合理的，也都在理性地追求自己想要的东西。但它们往往不会同时出现，最终哪种倾向占上风，取决于这两种意识采取的策略。在 Schelling 看来，如果我们能做出一个让对立面难以抗拒的重大承诺，就能提高我们想要的那一面获胜的机会。所以当贪睡的意识说「再睡一会儿吧」时，自律的意识就能用「我已经花了每周 70 美元请早晨的私教了」来反击。办理健身房会员、家里不存放香烟、放弃开车改为步行上班，这些都是 Schelling 所说的「破釜沉舟」（burning your bridges）策略的典型例子。

研究冲突的重要性不仅体现在军事领域，也关系到个人，接下来我们还会看到它对理解社会隔离现象也具有重要意义。而在这些研究的核心，离不开信息这个概念。

在社会研究中应用信息论并非创新之举，这种思路可以追溯到早于经济学家 Schelling 的年代。实际上，正是社会科学中统计方法的运用启发了物理学家 Boltzmann 将其应用于物理学，从而推导出著名的熵公式（entropy formula）。诚然，由于人类社会的复杂性（确实，人类社会比任何物理系统都要复杂得多），直接将信息论中的统计方法应用于社会研究具有更大的挑战性，但两者的基本前提是相同的。与物理学中典型的简单气体原子模型相比，每个人都具有更多的不确定性，因为每个人都能根据自身目标制定独特而复杂的策略。

在社会环境中，信息呈现出多种不同的面貌：它体现在人与人之间的联系中，反映在个人的行为与状态上，也表现为整个社会处理数据的能力等等。这些不同形式的信息都在社会的运转中扮演着重要角色。

在前几章中，我们曾简单提到过一个重要概念，但一直没有深入介绍，这就是「互信息」（mutual information）。这个概念对于我们理解自然界的众多现象至关重要，同时也是解释任何社会中各种结构形成过程的一把钥匙。

互信息（Mutual Information）是一个专业概念，用来描述两个（或更多）事件之间存在信息共享的情况。当事件之间存在互信息时，它们就不再是相互独立的；一个事件的发生可以告诉我们另一个事件的某些信息。举个简单的例子，在酒吧里，当有人问你要不要喝一杯时，你是否经常会说「你喝我就喝」？这句话实际上表明你把自己的行为和对方的行为完全关联在了一起。如果对方喝，你就喝；对方不喝，你也不喝。你的饮酒选择与对方的选择完全同步，用信息论的专业术语来说，这就是一个具有最大互信息的典型例子。

从更专业的角度来说，互信息（mutual information）的存在可以被视为一种推断的依据。当我们通过观察一个事物就能推断出另一个事物的特征时，我们就说这两个事物之间存在互信息。举个例子，如果我看到你面前有一杯饮料，根据既定规则（即你只会在同伴也喝饮料的时候喝），我就能推断出你的同伴面前也一定有一杯饮料。

当然，事件之间的互信息并非总是绝对的，有时候也会存在不确定性。比如说，你的朋友喝饮料时，你「通常」会跟着喝，但并不是每次都会这样。在这种情况下，两个事件之间的相关性就会降低，推断的准确度也会相应下降。

当我们讨论互信息（Mutual Information）时，实际上是在度量一个对象/个体/概念与另一个对象/个体/ 概念之间包含了多少共同信息。以电话通信为例，Alice 和 Bob 之间存在互信息。当 Alice 将信息传达给 Bob 后，两人就拥有了相同的信息。此时如果 Bob 告诉你这个信息的内容，在 Alice 和 Bob 之间互信息最大的情况下，你无需询问 Alice 就能知道她发送的信息。但在互信息不是最大的情况下（比如 Bob 可能遗忘了部分内容），我们只能部分推断出原始信息。

在脱氧核糖核酸（DNA）领域，DNA 分子携带着它们所编码蛋白质的信息。不同的 DNA 链之间也存在信息关联（众所周知，腺嘌呤（A）只与鸟嘌呤（G）配对，胞嘧啶（C）只与胸腺嘧啶（T）配对）。不仅如此，不同个体的 DNA 分子之间也存在信息关联（例如，父亲和儿子的遗传物质有 50% 是相同的）。同时，DNA 还与环境之间存在信息交互，这体现在环境通过自然选择影响着 DNA 的演化过程。

在热力学中，麦克斯韦妖（Maxwell's Demon）的记忆与粒子运动之间存在着互信息（Mutual Information）的关系。麦克斯韦妖能够获取的能量取决于它对粒子实际速度掌握的信息量。类似地，在金融市场中，如果不考虑随机投机的情况，投资获得的收益与你掌握的市场信息量密不可分。如果想要预测股票价格的走向，就需要掌握完整的市场信息，但考虑到信息的复杂性和海量程度，这几乎是不可能完成的任务。由于世界上的一切都存在某种程度的相互关联，互信息的概念可以说是无处不在。

在这里，我们将借助互信息的概念来解析两个现象：一个是我们所说的「全球化」现象，也就是世界各地社会之间联系日益紧密的过程；另一个是社会阶层分化现象，以及由此产生的社会隔离所带来的各种消极影响。

在深入探讨社会现象之前，我需要先解释物理学中一个重要的概念 —— 相变（phase transition）。简单来说，当系统中各个组成部分之间共享的信息量（mutual information）变得很大时，就会发生相变。这种现象在很多系统中都能观察到，比如装在箱子里的气体、放置在磁场中的铁棒、或是接入电路的铜线，它们的组成部分之间都会产生不同程度的信息共享。

当这种信息共享程度很高时，即使系统的基本组成部分没有改变，整个系统却会表现出完全不同的行为特征。这里需要特别说明的是，虽然每个独立的组成部分本身并没有发生变化，但它们作为一个整体却会展现出全新的行为模式。关键在于这些基本单元之间如何相互作用并形成群体效应。正如物理学家 Philip Anderson 所说的「数量的改变会带来质的飞跃」，这个深刻的观点为他在该领域的杰出贡献画上了完美的句点，并最终使他获得了 1977 年的诺贝尔奖。

群体行为的一个常见例子就是我们在日常生活中观察到的水沸腾或结冰的现象（也就是液体转化为气体或液体转化为固体的过程）。这种物质在结构和性质上发生的剧烈且明显的变化被称为相变（phase transition）。以结冰为例，当水发生相变时，水分子之间的作用力变得更强，从而形成更稳固的分子键合，最终形成了坚实的结构。

有趣的是，如果我们借鉴相变的概念，实际上可以更好地理解社会的形成过程，以及社会中发生的重大变革 —— 比如革命、内战或民主制度的建立。

现在我要通过一个具体的例子来详细解释什么是相变（phase transitions）。这个例子之后将成为我们的模型，帮助我们解释本章后续将要讨论的各种社会现象。让我们设想一个简单的固体，它由海量的原子构成（数以十亿计）。原子之间会产生相互作用，但这种作用通常仅限于与其直接相邻的原子之间。也就是说，只有相邻的原子之间才能相互影响，而间隔较远的原子之间则基本不会产生直接的相互作用。

基于「最近邻」（nearest neighbour）相互作用的原理，人们可能会认为只有相邻的原子之间才能共享信息，而在没有直接接触的地方就无法传递信息。这种想法虽然听起来符合逻辑，但实际上是完全错误的。让我们用鞭子来做个比喻：当你挥动鞭子的一端时，会直接影响到另一端的移动速度和幅度。这是因为运动通过鞭子中原子之间的互连性得以传递。即使相距较远的原子之间也能够共享信息，这是因为每个原子都与其相邻原子发生相互作用，而这些相邻原子又与它们的邻近原子产生作用，这种作用会不断传递下去。这个概念可以通过「六度分隔」（six degrees of separation）理论得到更优雅的诠释。

在这个星球上，经常有人说任何两个人之间最多只相隔六个人，这种说法乍一听令人难以置信，但深入分析就会发现这其实很合理。举个例子，我与 Bill Clinton 之间只有「三度分隔」（Three Degrees of Separation）。这是怎么实现的呢？我有一个在伦敦金融城工作的好朋友，他的上司认识该银行美国分部的负责人，而这位美国负责人恰好认识 Bill Clinton。这样一来，将 Bill Clinton 和我连接起来只需要三个人。虽然我对于自己与前总统 Clinton 只隔了三个人这件事并不特别在意（他想必也是如此），但这种联系本身确实很有趣。更有趣的是这种人际连接的运作方式：关键不在于你是否认识某个特定领域的人，而在于你是否与社会保持着联系。因为只要有了这种联系，你就能够接触到地球上几乎任何一个人（而在这个过程中总能找到了解你所需信息的人）。

我们很容易就能理解为什么任何两个人之间最多只需「六度分隔」（six degrees of separation）就能建立联系。假设我认识大约 100 个人（实际可能更多，不过研究表明人脑能够清晰分辨和记住的面孔与名字大约是 200 个 —— 这是我们从人类早期部落生活时期继承下来的生理特征）。我认识的这 100 个人，每个人又各自认识着 100 个人，按照这个方式延伸下去。经过五步连接后，这个数字就能达到 100 亿（100 的 5 次方，即 100×100×100×100×100）。而目前世界人口约为 60 亿。这意味着，按照这个模型，仅仅五步的社交连接就足以将地球上任何两个人联系起来。当然，现实中并非每个人都能认识 100 个人，所以可能需要六步才能构建起一个覆盖全球所有人的社交网络。这或许也解释了为什么我们在社会中往往会被那些人脉广泛的人所吸引 —— 这样可以让我们更好地融入这张庞大的社交网络。

为什么人与人之间的联系如此重要？你可能会说，社会的决策很大程度上是由个人控制的 —— 毕竟每个人都能独立思考。但显然，这种思考是建立在人们之间共享信息的基础之上的。正是这种个人之间的互动塑造了社会内部的各种结构，也形成了社会本身。

社会还可能具有其他一些特征，比如决策过程的集中程度。其中一个极端是独裁统治，这种情况分析起来并不有趣，因为在这种体制下，个人在决策中几乎没有发言权（从定义上来说）。另一个极端则更值得研究，也就是完全没有集中化的情况，每个人都能自主选择自己的立场。在这种情况下，我们希望看到的是纯粹通过人与人之间的互动产生共识 —— 而不是受到任何外部影响。这时候，人们之间共享的信息就显得尤为重要。那么问题来了：如果人们只能和少数几个周围的人交流，要如何才能达成一致的决定呢？

为了理解局部的相互作用是如何形成社会结构的，让我们用固体作为例子来说明。固体是由原子按照一定规律排列形成的。这次我们不讨论水是如何结冰的，而是来看看一个固体是如何变成磁铁的。固体中的每个原子都可以被看作一个微小的磁铁。起初，这些微小的磁铁之间互不影响，它们的磁极方向也没有统一的指向 —— 也就是说，每个原子磁铁都指向随机的方向。这时，整个固体 —— 也就是这些原子的集合体 —— 只是一堆随机排列的磁铁的集合，整体上并不显示磁性（这种状态在物理学中被称为顺磁体（paramagnet））。所有这些杂乱无章的原子磁铁的磁性会相互抵消，因此整体上不会产生磁场。

然而，当原子之间存在相互作用时，它们就能影响彼此的状态，即它们能使周围的原子的磁性方向与自己保持一致。这个过程类似于「六度分隔理论」（six degrees of separation）的原理：每个原子都会影响其周围的原子，这些被影响的原子又会继续影响它们周围的原子，最终使固体中的所有原子都建立起关联。如果这种相互作用的强度超过了外部温度带来的热扰动，那么所有磁性原子最终都会指向同一个方向，整个固体就会产生一个统一的磁场，从而表现出磁性！此时所有原子就像一个巨大的磁铁一样，表现出一致的行为。这个所有原子「自发」达到统一方向的临界点被称为「相变点」（phase transition），也就是固体转变为磁体的临界点。

我们能否将这个简单的概念应用到人类社会这样复杂的系统中呢？乍看之下，这似乎很难实现。我们可以把人类比作小磁铁（假设他们在「政治立场」上可以指向左或右），然后研究在什么条件下，整个社会会向左或向右产生倾向，以及这种转变是如何只需要很小的外部影响就能实现。这就像是把磁体的相变现象应用到社会领域。

你可能会说，与人类相比，原子是非常简单的系统。毕竟人类能够思考、感受和表达愤怒，而原子是没有生命的，其表现方式也要简单得多。但这不是重点！关键在于我们只关注人类（或原子）的某一个特定特征。原子本身也并非那么简单，只是我们选择只关注它的磁性特征，从而简化了问题。人类当然更为复杂，但此时我们只关心他们的政治倾向，而这一点在现实中往往是相对简单的。

我们来进一步探讨这个话题。人类和原子之间有一个根本的区别：人类拥有自由意志（free will）。人类可以自主行动，能够做出自己的决定，掌控自己的命运，而原子则做不到这些。尽管关于自由意志的讨论十分复杂（我们会在后面详细讨论），但在这里我们已经可以谈一些相关的观点。

设想你在观察一条繁忙街道的卫星图片，比如伦敦的牛津街。如果你使用 google.com 的卫星图片，你将无法分辨出每个行人的具体身份（当然，CIA 或 MOSSAD 应该能获得更高清晰度的图像）。在这些图片中，人们看起来就像是在两条直线（牛津街人行道的两边）之间移动的小点。街道中间还有一些体积较大的点，那是来往的车辆，不过我们暂时不去讨论这部分。

让我们来观察这些点的运动方式。它们主要是在街道上上下下移动，但由于需要相互避让，也会有一些左右移动。假设现在有人给你看这样一幅运动的点阵图，但没告诉你这些点代表着人。你能仅凭这些点的运动模式，判断出它们是代表有生命的物体（也许还是具有智能的生命？）还是无生命的物体（比如原子或碰撞的台球）吗？

很可能你无法做出判断，因为在这种情况下，人群和原子的运动模式惊人地相似（它们都会避免碰撞，只是方式不同：人是通过视觉感知来移动，而原子是通过静电斥力）。这两种现象都可以被描述为扩散过程（diffusion process）—— 整体上呈现出一个主要方向（上下）的流动，但时不时会出现一些随机的偏移。这正好说明了我想表达的观点：生命体和非生命体的行为模式可以表现出惊人的相似性。

让我们回到相变（phase transition）与人类社会的话题。想象一下，我们有这样一个系统：它像链条一样，每个部分都只能和左右相邻的两个部分产生相互作用。这个模型最早是由 Ernest Ising 在物理学领域提出的，他在 1920 年代读博士时研究过这个问题。然而结果令人遗憾，他通过严密的数学证明表明，这种模型中根本不可能出现相变现象。换句话说，如果把链条上的原子想象成小磁铁，不管外界条件如何变化，这些小磁铁都不可能自动排列整齐。这个结论对 Ising 来说是个巨大的打击，因为他原本希望能从微观层面解释相变现象，结果却让他在获得博士学位后就放弃了物理学研究！

不过对 Ising 来说真是太可惜了，因为大约 20 年后，Lars Onsager 在一篇极具创见的论文中证明，如果把这些原子排列成二维平面（而不是一维链条），那么在温度足够低的情况下，确实会发生相变。这项发现为 Onsager 赢得了化学领域的诺贝尔奖。从那以后，相变理论研究开始蓬勃发展，诞生了许多重大突破，并产生了多位诺贝尔奖得主（包括 Anderson 在内）。

在我所了解的相变（phase transitions）研究中，最引人注目的发现之一是一个非常普遍的「禁止定理」（no-go theorem）。禁止定理是一类重要的理论成果，它们可以用来证明某些特定的物理现象是不可能发生的。物理学家 Ising 提出的结果就是一个特殊的禁止定理，它证明了在一维系统（即类似于链状结构）中不可能发生相变。更有趣的是，科学家们还证明了在二维系统（即类似于平面结构）中也普遍不存在相变现象。在二维情况下，这个禁止定理只有一个例外，那就是物理学家 Onsager 所分析的模型（这使他的研究显得格外幸运）。这些发现具有深远的意义 —— 当我们在现实世界中观察到冰变成水、水变成水蒸气这样的相变现象时，这实际上已经从数学上证明了我们所处的宇宙必须至少是三维的。

那么，这一切与人类社会有什么联系呢？在上述系统中，我们可以把原子不是看作小磁铁，而是看作人类。诚然，如前所述，人类比原子要复杂得多，但我们的某些特征其实非常简单。让我们思考一下人类及其政治倾向。假设在一个社会中，我们只有两种选择：要么保守，要么自由。这两种状态就像磁铁的两种状态在人类社会中的对应：要么指向右边，要么指向左边（当然，我很清楚一些愤世嫉俗的人可能会说，在政治中「掌权」或「失势」才是更重要的方向）。

一般来说，一个社会中总是有一部分人持保守立场，另一部分人持自由立场。但是，如果我们问：在什么条件下所有成员都会变成自由派呢？根据我们对伊辛模型（Ising model）结果的讨论可以推断，如果我们有一个非常简单的社会，其中每个成员只与最近的两个邻居讨论政治（而不与其他人交流），那么就不可能出现一个完全由自由派构成的社会。换句话说，我们永远不可能实现自发的自由化，社会中总会存在一定数量的保守派。

一个一维结构的社会组织非常容易理解，因为它的变化都很可预测。电影《Goodfellas》（好家伙）中描绘的黑手党就是一个典型例子（这显然与自由社会大相径庭）。黑手党的最高领袖，也就是意大利语中所说的「教父中的教父」（capo di tutti capi），是一个叫 Pauly 的人。他只会向最信任的两个手下传达指令，很少与其他人直接接触。这两个手下再将命令传达给他们各自信任的下属，以此类推。这种结构不仅能有效地防止 FBI 发现黑手党的核心人物，同时也确保了组织内部的稳定性。正因如此，黑手党组织整体上不太可能发生剧烈的变革，比如突然更换领导人，或是因为个别叛徒告密而导致组织瓦解。

有趣的是，如果我们假设每个人都能与其他所有人产生互动，那么即使在一维空间中也可能发生状态的突变。而现实世界则介于完全隔离和完全互联这两种极端情况之间。我们既不会仅仅与邻居打交道，也不可能和世界上的每一个人都有联系。正如我之前提到的，我们能够保持经常联系的家人、朋友和熟人的数量通常在 200 人左右。

事实上，我们与他人的社交联系数量遵循一个称为幂律分布（power law distribution）的规律。认识很多人的人数要比认识较少人的人数要少得多。这种数量比例遵循着一个严格的规律，这与本书前面提到的描述字母出现频率的齐普夫定律类似。具体来说，拥有 1000 个社交联系的人比拥有 10 个社交联系的人要少 100 万倍。就像在英语中较长的单词出现频率较低一样，拥有大量社交连接的人在统计学上也是较为罕见的现象。

人与人之间接触频率的不平衡形成了一个非常重要的模型：人们与周围的人频繁接触，同时偶尔也会与远方的人产生联系。这就是所谓的「小世界网络」（Small World Network），它很好地解释了为什么疾病能在我们的世界中快速传播以及其传播方式。当我们患病时，疾病通常会先感染周围的人。而当这些人中只要有一个进行远途旅行，病毒就有可能在远距离的地方开始传播。这也正是我们对猪流感以及其他可能致命的病毒如此担忧的原因。

我们来探讨一个问题：为什么很多人认为（不管这种观点是否正确），信息革命对社会的改变将超过历史上任何一次革命，包括我们在前几章讨论过的工业革命。著名社会学家 Manuel Castells 就认为，互联网将为我们的社会带来前所未有的深刻变革。他的这一观点建立在相变（phase transitions）理论的基础之上，虽然作为一名社会学家，他对这一概念的理解可能与物理学家从数学角度的诠释有所不同。

为了解释这一点，我们可以把早期人类社会理解为具有很强的「地域性」（local）特征。当时的部落分散在不同的地方，彼此之间很少有往来和交流。即使到了十九世纪末期，思想的传播和信息的交流依然是一个缓慢的过程。也就是说，在很长一段时间里，人类社会的交流范围都受到了严重的地理限制。从物理学的角度来看，这种情况下就不可能发生突然的剧烈变化。考虑到社会系统的复杂性，我们更倾向于说社会的根本变革是「不太可能」而非「完全不可能」。而在最近这些年，随着科技的快速发展，我们不仅可以四处旅行，还能通过互联网与世界上几乎任何一个人进行学习和交流。

早期社会就像伊辛模型（Ising model）那样，个体之间的互动较为局限和固定，而后来的社会则更像小世界网络（small world networks）那样逐渐复杂化。然而，我们现在正在快速迈向一个新的阶段：每个人都能够并且实际上正在与世界上的任何其他人产生联系。正是在这种高度互联的状态下，社会系统发生突然性质变化（phase transitions）的可能性也在不断增加。在当今世界，资金（甚至劳动力）能够在几秒钟甚至更短的时间内从地球的一端快速流动到另一端。毫无疑问，这种前所未有的互联性正在深刻影响着我们社会的方方面面。

用信息论来分析社会结构往往能发现一些出人意料的现象。这就是为什么我们需要了解信息论的基本语言，因为如果没有系统的理论框架作为基础，我们就很难从根本上理解一些最令人震惊且富有启发的社会现象。让我们拿现代社会中的种族居住隔离现象来说。在今天的洛杉矶，白人、拉丁裔和非裔美国人的居住区域有着清晰的界限。显然，这种隔离并非来自法律的强制（从法律上讲，每个人都可以自由选择在任何地方购买房产），那么我们是否就必须得出结论说这些人都是种族主义者呢？根据 Schelling 的研究，答案令人意外：并非如此。事实上，即便是最推崇自由平等的社区，最终也可能演变成居住隔离的状态。从这个角度来看，这种隔离现象的形成过程，与我们之前讨论的物理学中的相变现象（如水变成冰的过程）非常相似。

为了模拟社会隔离现象，Schelling 提出了一个非常简单的模型，这个模型的原理与此前讲到的磁体相变模型相似。我们可以想象有一个二维网格，在这个网格上随机摆放黑色和白色的小块。如果我们把这种状态比作现实中的社区分布，就相当于一个非常开放且充分混合的社区（就像磁体模型中完全混乱的状态一样，每个微小磁体都指向不同的方向）。

现在我们需要研究这个系统是如何随时间演化的，以及隔离现象是如何产生的。Schelling 提出了一个简单的规则：每个个体都会观察周围的邻居，如果发现周围有一定数量的不同类型的邻居，就会选择搬到别处。显然，如果人们持有极端的种族歧视态度（比如仅仅因为有一个不同类型的邻居就要搬走），那么隔离现象就会出现。然而，Schelling 发现了一个出人意料的现象：即使人们非常包容开放，只有在所有邻居都与自己不同时才会搬走，社会最终仍然会自然形成隔离状态。

这个现象在物理学的 Ising 模型中也有对应：即使是最微弱的相互作用，也足以让系统发生相变（phase transition）。在这个模型中，相互作用会使相邻的自旋趋向一致排列，这就像 Schelling 模型中邻近区域的居民最终趋向同质化一样。（值得一提的是，当我们把城市比作一个二维结构时，与一维结构不同，二维的 Ising 模型确实会展现出相变现象。）

从互信息（mutual information）的角度来理解这个现象是最自然的方式。在完全混乱的初始状态下，互信息很少 —— 这是因为通过观察一个单元，很难推测出邻近单元的特征（因为按照定义，这些单元最初是随机分布的）。然而，在一个完全分离的社会中，互信息达到最大值，因为你只要看到一个单元，就能推测出它周围所有单元的特征。这与我们之前讨论过的其他状态转换现象类似，互信息在这里成为了社会分离的一个重要指标（这种分离状态就像磁铁中所有磁极都整齐排列的有序状态一样，表现出高度的一致性）。

如果你真正理解了 Schelling 的这个简单模型，就会发现它的应用范围远不止种族隔离现象。这个模型可以用来研究社会中各种群体的分化现象。无论是政治立场、经济地位、社交圈子还是知识层次的分化，都可以用这个相同的逻辑来分析和理解。

虽然我们在这里对社会进行了相当程度的简化，但我们的分析中确实包含了一些符合实际的观点。要验证这些观点的准确程度，我们不妨通过一个简单的问题来检验：在一个典型的社会中，财富是如何分配的？这个问题完美地结合了上一章我们讨论的机会因素，以及本章正在探讨的社会因素。

如果像我一直强调的那样，信息是构成每个社会的基础，那么通过研究信息的最优化是否能帮助我们理解社会中的财富分配规律呢？对此，我的回答是既对也不对。让我们先来看看为什么说「不对」。

当我们优化香农信息（Shannon information）时，通常会得到一种称为高斯分布或钟形曲线的概率分布。这种分布是以德国数学家 Karl Friedrich Gauss 的名字命名的，他最早发现了高斯分布在自然界中的普遍性。举个例子，气体中原子的速度分布就遵循高斯分布规律。在这个分布中，大部分原子的运动速度都集中在某个中间值附近（比如每秒 500 米）。随着速度偏离这个中间值，原子的数量会对称减少，比如每秒 400 米和 600 米处的原子数量会同样变少。当观测的速度进一步远离中间值时，相应的原子数量会迅速降低。这就是高斯分布最显著的特征，也是它为什么会呈现出标志性的钟形曲线形状的原因。

在大多数社会中，财富分布并不呈高斯分布（Gaussian distribution）。它实际上是一个幂律分布（power law）。这意味着非常富有的人群数量很少，而贫困人口的数量则非常庞大。如果财富遵循高斯分布，那么大多数人的财富水平会集中在中间位置，只是在富裕和贫穷两端有小幅度的波动。然而遗憾的是，在我们所知的任何社会中都从未出现过这种情况（就连过去的苏联这样的计划经济体制下也不例外）。

那么，这种幂律分布是如何形成的呢？为什么你银行账户里有 100 万美元的概率比有 1000 美元的概率小 1000 倍？这正是幂律分布的典型特征。举个例子，如果一个国家有 100 个百万富翁，那么就会有 10 万人只拥有 1000 美元。

这种现象背后的原因是什么呢？虽然我们还没有完整的答案，但我们可以做出一些推测（如果我真的知道答案，恐怕现在已经在飞往斯德哥尔摩领取诺贝尔经济学奖的路上了）。目前最普遍的解释是一个被称为「富者愈富」的原理。简单来说，财富不是简单地相加增长，而是呈现倍数增长。拥有更多资源的人会按比例获得更多回报，这导致贫富差距会按照幂律（power law）不断扩大。即使一开始每个人的起点都是相同的，但由于个人际遇的细微随机差异（比如有人在股市中盈利，有人则亏损），这些小差异最终都会演变成巨大的差距。

那么，这是否意味着信息与财富分配完全无关呢？并非如此。人们积累财富的过程不仅仅依靠个人努力，还要通过各种社会机制建立起来的关系网络。社会互动是极其复杂的，在任何社会的各个层面都在同时发生着。这种社会关系的变化既复杂又快速，往往转瞬即逝。

这意味着我们预期信息不具有加和特性（additive property），也就是说两个独立事件包含的联合信息（joint information）必须等于每个单独事件信息量的总和（这个性质在第 3 章中被用来推导香农熵（Shannon's entropy））。如果这种加和性质不成立，那么正确的信息度量就不再是香农提出的方法了。巴西物理学家 Constantino Tsallis 就是一位深入研究这些非加和度量的学者。那么，为什么财富不具有加和性呢？就像我们看到的，已有的财富加上新获得的财富，最终的结果往往大于简单的算术相加。财富不是简单的相加，而是会产生额外的增值效应！这其实是经济学中收益递增原理（principle of increasing returns）的另一种表现形式（我们在第 6 章中讨论过）。这种现象并不矛盾，因为财富不是一个守恒量（conserved quantity）。它可以从无到有被创造出来（这里说的「无」是指「没有初始资金」，而不是说不需要任何实际资源）。

如果我们使用一个不同于香农信息论公式的方程，但仍保持概率的反函数关系，我们就能解释幂律分布（power law distribution）现象。因此，即便是社会发展和稳定性的重要特征之一 —— 财富分配模式 —— 也可以用简单的信息理论来解释。这种解释虽然没有直接使用香农的公式，但无疑体现了香农理论的精髓。

对于信息时代的影响，社会学家们意见不一。乐观派认为，信息时代将创造一个更加公平的社会，不仅能提高所有人的生活水平，还能缩小富人和穷人之间的差距。悲观派则认为，新时代将给现有社会秩序带来剧变，可能通过多种方式引发社会动荡，比如家庭结构解体导致犯罪增加、全球恐怖主义的威胁、全球气候变暖等问题。

信息论可能无法预测我们的未来。但有一点是可以确定的：随着全球联系日益紧密，我们必须加快思考和决策的速度。在这个高度互联的社会中，我们越来越容易受到突发变化的影响。信息的相互传递和影响正在以惊人的速度增长，如果我们想要做出明智的决策，就必须确保自己处理信息的能力能够与时俱进。看来，未来不仅属于勇敢的人，也属于反应最快的人。

在了解了信息如何成为社会、生物和物理现象的基础之后，我们现在要将讨论提升到一个新的高度。让我们回溯到几个根本性的问题：这些信息是从哪里来的？宇宙中究竟蕴含着多少信息？信息处理的极限速度是多少？这些问题的答案构成了我们前面所有章节的理论基础。要理解信息的终极起源，我们需要展开一段奇妙的探索之旅，这将带领我们深入量子力学的领域，探讨随机性的本质，思考瞬间传送的可能性，以及探究自由意志与决定论的问题。这将是一段充满挑战的旅程，准备好迎接挑战吧！

### Key points

Correlated systems are those that share some common information.

Individuals in a society become correlated in many ways thorough various interactions, by communication for example.

Societies are networks of correlated individuals. The degree of correlation and networking determines what kind of society we have.

Most societies exist between the two extremes: completely connected and completely disconnected individuals. Such societies are an example of small world networks and explain many social phenomena, from the spread of disease to the winner-takes-all and fit-get-rich principles.

关键要点：

关联系统（Correlated systems）指的是共享某些共同信息的系统。

人类社会中的成员会通过各种互动方式（例如交流沟通）建立起不同层次的联系。

社会本质上是一个由相互关联的个体组成的网络。而这种关联的程度和网络化的水平，最终决定了社会的形态和特征。

大多数社会都处于两种极端状态的中间：成员之间要么完全相互连接，要么完全互不相连。这种社会结构是小世界网络（small world networks）的典型例子，它可以解释许多社会现象，包括疾病的传播方式，以及为什么会出现「赢家通吃」和「适者致富」等社会规律。
