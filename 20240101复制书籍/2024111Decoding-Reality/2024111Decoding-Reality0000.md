Decoding Reality: The Universe as Quantum Information

For a physicist, all the world is information. The Universe and its workings are the ebb and flow of information. We are all transient patterns of information, passing on the recipe for our basic forms to future generations using a four-letter digital code called DNA. In this engaging and mind-stretching account, Vlatko Vedral considers some of the deepest questions about the Universe and considers the implications of interpreting it in terms of information. He explains the nature of information, the idea of entropy, and the roots of this thinking in thermodynamics. He describes the bizarre effects of quantum behaviour — effects such as 'entanglement', which Einstein called 'spooky action at a distance', and explores cutting edge work on harnessing quantum effects in hyperfast quantum computers, and how recent evidence suggests that the weirdness of the quantum world, once thought limited to the tiniest scales, may reach into the macro world. Vedral finishes by considering the answer to the ultimate question: where did all of the information in the Universe come from? The answers he considers are exhilarating, drawing upon the work of distinguished physicist John Wheeler. The ideas challenge our concept of the nature of particles, of time, of determinism, and of reality itself. This edition includes a new foreword from the author, reflecting on changes in the world of quantum information since first publication. Oxford Landmark Science books are 'must-read' classics of modern science writing which have crystallized big ideas, and shaped the way we think.

在物理学家眼中，世界的本质就是信息。宇宙及其运作过程都可以用信息的流动来描述。我们每个人都是短暂存在的信息模式，通过被称为 DNA 的四个字母组成的生命密码，将我们基本形态的「配方」传递给下一代。在这部既能引发读者兴趣又充满思辨性的著作中，Vlatko Vedral 探讨了一些关于宇宙最深邃的问题，并思考了从信息论角度诠释宇宙的深层含义。他阐释了信息的本质、熵（entropy）的概念，以及这些思想在热力学中的根源。他描述了量子行为的种种奇特现象 —— 例如量子纠缠（entanglement），这种爱因斯坦称之为「超距作用」的现象，并探讨了如何利用量子效应来开发超高速量子计算机的前沿研究。同时，他还探讨了最新研究证据，这些证据表明量子世界的奇特性质可能并不仅仅存在于微观尺度，还可能延伸到宏观世界。在书的最后，Vedral 探讨了一个根本性的问题：宇宙中的所有信息究竟来自何方？他借鉴了杰出物理学家 John Wheeler 的研究成果，提出的答案令人耳目一新。这些观点挑战了我们对粒子本质、时间、决定论和现实本身的认知。这个版本增加了作者的新序言，回顾了自首次出版以来量子信息领域发生的变化。作为牛津科学经典丛书的一部分，这本书是现代科学写作中的必读经典，它不仅凝练了重大科学思想，更塑造了我们理解世界的方式。

## Praise for Decoding Reality

‘An engaging, non-technical exploration of what the new theory of quantum information and computation tells us about life, the universe, and everything.'

David Deutsch, author of The Fabric of Reality

‘Let Vedral guide you skilfully through the wonderland of modern physics – where nothing is as it seems. This is the finest treatment I have read of the weird interplay of quantum reality, information and probability.'

Paul Davies, author of The Eerie Silence and The Goldilocks Enigma

‘How [do we] define "information". Most of us have a rough idea. Vedral has a very precise, scientific definition: it is the logarithm of the inverse of the probability of an event. Or, more simply, the more unexpected an event, the more information it contains.'

Financial Times

‘Vlatko Vedral, an Oxford physicist, examines the claim that bits of information are the universe's basic units, and the universe as a whole is a giant quantum computer. He argues that all of reality can be explained if readers accept that information is at the root of everything. So what is information? Mr Vedral's notion of information is not the somewhat fuzzy concept most people have of it, but a precise mathematical definition.'

The Economist

## Foreword

Much has happened to the world of quantum information since I wrote this book more than seven years ago. We have had an explosion of activities all aimed at building a quantum computer. Google, Microsoft, IBM, and many other major companies are investing in various technologies to support stable quantum bits. There are many startups, most of which are not surprisingly in the Silicon Valley, all joining the race to make the first large-scale quantum computer. The bets currently are with three different implementations: superconductors, cold atoms, and photons.

The times are clearly even more exciting for quantum information as various governments are also joining forces: the United Kingdom has invested 280 million pounds in a number of Quantum Hubs and the European Union has earmarked a billion euro flagship project to develop quantum technologies. The strong international players outside of Europe and the USA are Singapore (where I spend a great deal of my research time at the Centre for Quantum Technologies), Australia, Canada, and now, China. On top of pursuing quantum computers, China has been developing various quantum satellite technologies and this alone has been a major new trend since the first publication of Decoding Reality.

The industrial attitudes have changed so much that quantum computers are now seen as more or less inevitable at some point in the not so distant future. But while the technology landscape has dramatically changed, the most important thing, however, has not changed at all. This is the fact that—as I argue in this book—the most fruitful way of viewing reality is still as being made up of quantum bits of information. If anything, this thesis that the most fundamental aspect of reality is information, and not energy or matter, is now even more forcefully apparent than ever before. And it might even be at the core of our next fundamental theory of reality, which will merge quantum theory and gravity in a unique corpus of laws.

When Decoding Reality first appeared in 2010, it was—to my surprise—considered controversial in some circles. I think it will be much less so now. I do hope, however, that this does not diminish the enjoyment the reader might have when learning about some fun aspects of science as seen through the eyes of a quantum information practitioner like myself.

前言

自从我七年多前写作这本书以来，量子信息领域发生了翻天覆地的变化。我们见证了量子计算机研发的蓬勃发展。Google、Microsoft、IBM 等众多科技巨头都在投入研发各种技术，以实现稳定的量子比特（quantum bits）。大量创业公司也加入了研发首台大规模量子计算机的竞争，这些公司不出意外地大多集中在硅谷。目前，研究主要集中在三种不同的实现方案上：超导体、冷原子和光子。

随着各国政府的积极参与，量子信息领域变得愈发令人振奋：英国向多个量子研究中心投资了 2.8 亿英镑，欧盟则启动了一个投资额高达十亿欧元的量子技术旗舰计划。在欧美之外，新加坡（我在那里的量子技术中心投入了大量研究时间）、澳大利亚、加拿大以及中国都是重要的参与者。除了量子计算机的研发，中国还在积极发展量子卫星技术，这是自《揭秘现实》首次出版以来出现的一个重要发展方向。

产业界的态度已经发生了根本性的转变，普遍认为在不远的将来，量子计算机的出现将是大势所趋。尽管技术格局发生了巨大变化，但最本质的东西却始终如一。正如我在本书中论述的那样，将现实视为量子信息比特的集合仍然是理解现实的最有效方式。事实上，「信息才是现实最基本的组成部分，而不是能量或物质」这一论点在今天比以往任何时候都更加显而易见。这一观点甚至可能成为我们下一个基础理论的核心，这个理论将在统一的理论框架中融合量子理论与引力理论。

《揭秘现实》在 2010 年首次出版时，出乎我的意料，在某些学术领域引发了争议。我想现在这种争议已经大大减少了。不过，我希望这并不会影响读者通过一个量子信息研究者的视角来了解科学的趣味性所获得的阅读乐趣。

## Acknowledgements

There are a number of people who should be thanked and without whom this book would not have existed. I have been influenced by many researchers in the past 15 years of my research career. In alphabetical order those who did most are Janet Anders, Charles Bennett, Sougato Bose, Časlav Brukner, Keith Burnett, David Deutsch, Artur Ekert, Peter Knight, William Wootters, and Anton Zeilinger. They will find much of themselves in the pages of this book.

I would like to thank the departments of physics at the Universities of Oxford and Leeds, UK, and the National University of Singapore who have provided me with a great environment encouraging scientific debate and giving me a better opportunity to communicate science to a wider audience.

Writing is a very solitary exercise and it has been a great pleasure to be able to talk about some aspects of this book to a ‘live' audience. Those who attended my various Café Scientifique talks and similar occasions will recognize some material from my talks in here. I am a great believer in taking science out of the University confines and onto the streets. That is where it all started – in the Ancient Greek agorae of Socrates – and that's where it ultimately belongs. I hope that the book preserves some traces of this ‘streetwise' style of communicating science.

Luke Rallan's constant help and encouragement as well as reading and commenting on various drafts and ideas are very gratefully acknowledged. He provided much of the stimulus at different stages and without his help this project would never have materialized. I am also grateful to Latha Menon of Oxford University Press and Kerry McKenzie at the University of Leeds whose extensive comments have improved the manuscript.

I thank various UK and international bodies for funding my research. In particular, the Royal Society and the Wolfson Foundation have been very generous in their support.

My wife Ivona, my sons Mikey and Leo, and my daughter Mia have suffered a great deal in the past two years. They are everything I have – the alpha and the omega – and without them, there would be no reality to decode. I hope to make up for the lost time in the years to come.

## Prologue

In autumn 1994, while a final year undergraduate student in London, sorting through my reading material for the forthcoming term, I found three words that would have a profound effect on my future. These three words got me thinking again about questions that I have encountered both in life and in physics. At the time I wasn't exactly sure what they meant, but steadily things started to make sense.

Every child is at some point exposed to various rules (laws and principles) that seem to govern the functioning of the Universe and everything in it. Newton's laws in physics, the photosynthesis cycle in biology, rules of grammar in French, the law of supply and demand in economics, the list just goes on. As a child I remember feeling a little lost and bewildered by these rules that I was required to learn verbatim and just attributed their origin to a magician's trick, something my teacher pulled out of a hat. Further along in life, as our senses and our understanding of the world around us develops, these ‘tricks' don't seem quite so intimidating. We are better able to deconstruct them and find that many are not so dissimilar after all. Then at some point, after exploring a sufficient number of these rules across different disciplines, we are in a position to begin speculating on their connection and whether there is a little master book of magic which governs them all. It is this bigger picture that now drives me and many others. Whatever walk of life you come from, the question remains the same: is the reality that we see around us just made up from a seemingly random collection of unrelated rules and events or is there a common underlying thread from which these all derive?

From the dawn of civilization, some of our most inquisitive minds have been pursuing this common thread. By linking together the rubbing of rock on rock or wood on wood we have been able to create fire. By linking together the falling of an apple to the orbits of planets, we have been able to fly to the Moon. By linking together our understanding of molecules with engineering, we have been able to extend human life by successfully performing the vast array of bodily repairs. By linking together our understanding of human nature with communications technology, we have a global market for products and services regardless of the language we speak. Our attempts at understanding and linking different aspects of reality have clearly been very beneficial.

As we continue to further increase our understanding we expect this progress to continue. There is no doubt that any such future development will be based on how well we can interpret new information and connect what we have learned thus far. By continuing to create more connections we can develop more all-encompassing laws which we then in turn use to better understand and affect our reality. In other words, first we break down or decode what we see around us, just to then use this information to construct or encode a better, more well-connected, picture. The big question, of course, is how much can we connect – is it feasible that there is one ultimate law, one master magician's trick, that describes the whole Universe?

Within this discourse, surely the most exciting and fundamental question of all has to be: why is there a reality at all and where does it come from? In other words, before we can even speak about why things are connected, we need to ask ourselves why things exist in the first place. I will argue in this book that the notion of ‘information' gives us the answer to both questions. Curiously, this makes information a far more fundamental quantity in the Universe than matter or energy, which is no mean feat in itself. If we look at reality in terms of ‘bits of information', it is interesting that both the existence of reality and its inherent connectivity become completely transparent. Irrespective of whether you are a casual reader or a scientific researcher this has extraordinary implications for each and every one of us.

The three words that I read back in autumn 1994, which changed my perspective so markedly, were ‘Information is physical'. The three words, in this order, stood out as the title of an amazing chapter in an otherwise obscure book, and over time made me realize that indeed maybe information is the answer. After having spent the last 15 years convincing myself that it is, I now endeavour to spend the next 12 chapters convincing you likewise.

序章

1994 年秋天，我还是伦敦一名大四学生，在整理新学期的阅读材料时，我发现了三个改变我未来的词。这三个词让我重新思考在生活和物理学中遇到的诸多问题。虽然当时我并不完全理解它们的含义，但随着时间推移，一切渐渐明朗起来。

每个孩子在成长过程中都会接触到各种看似主宰着宇宙及其中一切运作的规则（定律和原理）。物理学中的牛顿定律，生物学中的光合作用循环，法语中的语法规则，经济学中的供需法则，这样的例子不胜枚举。作为一个孩子，我记得对这些需要机械记忆的规则感到困惑和茫然，只能把它们的来源想象成某种神奇的法则，就像老师变魔术一样神秘莫测。随着年龄增长，当我们对周围世界的感知和理解不断深入时，这些「神奇法则」似乎不再那么难以理解。我们能够更好地分析它们，发现许多规则之间其实有着共通之处。在探索了不同学科的众多规则之后，我们开始思考它们之间的联系，是否存在一个统领所有规则的终极法则。正是这种对终极真理的追寻驱动着我和许多研究者。无论你来自什么领域，核心问题始终如一：我们周围的现实究竟是由看似随机的互不相关的规则和事件构成，还是存在一条贯穿一切的基本线索？

从人类文明开始，一些最具探索精神的科学家就一直在寻找这条贯穿万物的线索。通过理解石头或木头之间的摩擦，我们掌握了生火的技术。通过将苹果坠落与行星运动联系起来，我们实现了登月的壮举。通过将分子科学与工程技术结合，我们通过各种医疗手段延长了人类的寿命。通过将人性认知与通信技术结合，我们建立了一个跨越语言的全球化市场。我们试图理解和连接现实不同层面的努力显然收获颇丰。

随着认知的不断深入，我们期待这种进步能够持续。毫无疑问，任何未来的突破都将建立在我们如何诠释新信息并整合现有知识的基础之上。通过不断建立新的联系，我们可以发展出更具普适性的定律，从而更好地理解和影响我们的现实。换句话说，我们首先需要解构和分析周围的现象，然后利用这些信息重建一个更完整、更系统的认知体系。当然，最大的问题是：我们能在多大程度上实现这种统一 —— 是否真的存在一个终极定律，一个能够描述整个宇宙的根本原理？

在这个探索过程中，最令人兴奋和最根本的问题无疑是：为什么会有现实的存在，它从何而来？换句话说，在我们探讨事物之间的联系之前，我们需要先思考事物存在的本源。在这本书中，我将论证「信息」这个概念能够同时回答这两个问题。有趣的是，这使得信息成为比物质或能量更为基础的宇宙要素，这本身就是一个重大发现。如果我们从「信息比特」的角度审视现实，现实的存在及其内在联系就变得清晰可见。无论你是普通读者还是科研工作者，这都会对我们每个人产生深远的影响。

1994 年秋天，那三个改变了我世界观的词是「信息是物理的」（Information is physical）。这三个词是一本专业著作中一个引人深思的章节标题，随着时间推移，它让我逐渐意识到，信息可能就是终极答案。在用了 15 年时间确信这一点后，我希望通过接下来的 12 个章节，也能让你和我一样确信这一观点。

## Epilogue

This book has argued that everything in our reality is made up of information. From the evolution of life to the dynamics of social ordering to the functioning of quantum computers, they can all be understood in terms of bits of information. We saw that in order to capture all the latest elements of reality we needed to extend Shannon's original notion of information, and upgrade his notion from bits to quantum bits, or qubits. Qubits incorporate the fact that in quantum theory outcomes to our measurements are intrinsically random.

But where do these qubits come from? Quantum theory allows us to answer this question; but the answer is not quite what we expected. It suggests that these qubits come from nowhere! There is no prior information required in order for information to exist. Information can be created from emptiness. In presenting a solution to the sticky question of ‘law without law' we find that information breaks the infinite chain of regression in which we always seem to need a more fundamental law to explain the current one. This feature of information, ultimately coming from our understanding of quantum theory, is what distinguishes information from any other concept that could potentially unify our view of reality, such as matter or energy. Information is, in fact, unique in this respect.

Viewing reality as information leads us to recognize two competing trends in its evolution. These trends, or let's call them arrows, work hand in hand, but point in opposite directions. The first arrow orders the world against the Second Law of thermodynamics and compresses all the spontaneously generated information in the Universe into a set of well-defined principles. The second arrow then generates our view of reality from these principles.

It is clear that the more efficient we are in compressing all the spontaneously generated information, the faster we can expand our reality of what is and isn't possible. But without the second arrow, without an elementary view of our reality, we cannot even begin to describe the Universe. We cannot access parts of the Universe that have no corresponding basis in our reality. After all, whatever is outside our reality is unknown to us. We don't yet know what we don't know!

But let's try to look beyond this, into the unknown. What if the second arrow, which generates our view of reality, somehow affects the first arrow – our compression of the information that the Universe gives us? It is not so surprising that this relationship has been the key in the evolution of our reality thus far. By exploring our reality we better understand how to look for and compress the information that the Universe produces. This in turn then affects our reality. Everything that we have understood, every piece of knowledge, has been acquired by feeding these two arrows into one another. Whether it is biological propagation of life, astrophysics, economics, or quantum mechanics, these are all a consequence of our constant re-evaluation of reality. So it's clear that not only does the second arrow depend on the first, it is natural that the first arrow also depends on the second.

But if indeed they are mutually dependent, where exactly does this leave us? Not anywhere clear cut I'm afraid. Neither arrow can exist on its own and is somehow predetermined by its complement. Once the initial symmetry is broken and we get information out of no information, the first and the second arrow play out their roles within a self-perpetuating cycle. We compress information to generate our laws of Nature, and then use these laws of Nature to generate more information, which then gets compressed back into upgraded laws of Nature.

The dynamics of the two arrows is driven by our desire to understand the Universe. As we drill deeper and deeper into our reality we expect to find a better understanding of the Universe. We believe that the Universe to some degree behaves independently of us and the Second Law tells us that the amount of information in the Universe is increasing. But what if with the second arrow, which generates our view of reality, we can affect parts of the Universe and create new information? In other words, through our existence could we affect the Universe within which we exist? This would make the information generated by us a part of the new information the Second Law talks about.

A scenario like this presents no conceptual problem within our picture. This new information can also be captured by the first arrow, as it fights, through conjectures and refutations, to incorporate any new information into the basic laws of Nature. However, could it be that there is no other information in the Universe than that generated by us as we create our own reality?

This leads us to a startling possibility. If indeed the randomness in the Universe, as demonstrated by quantum mechanics, is a consequence of our generation of reality then it is as if we create our own destiny. It is as if we exist within a simulation, where there is a program that is generating us and everything that we see around us. Think back to the movie The Matrix, where Keanu Reeves lives in a simulation until he is offered a way out, a way back into reality. If the randomness in the Universe is due to our own creation of reality, then there is no way out for us. This is because, in the end, we are creators of our own simulation. In such a scenario, Reeves would wake up in his reality only to find himself sitting at the desk programming his own simulation. This closed loop was echoed by John Wheeler who said: ‘physics gives rise to observer-participancy; observer-participancy gives rise to information; information gives rise to physics.'

But whether reality is self-simulating (and hence there is no Universe required outside of it) is, by definition, something that we will never know. What we can say, following the logic presented in this book, is that outside of our reality there is no additional description of the Universe that we can understand, there is just emptiness. This means that there is no scope for the ultimate law or supernatural being – given that both of these would exist outside of our reality and in the darkness. Within our reality everything exists through an interconnected web of relationships and the building blocks of this web are bits of information. We process, synthesize, and observe this information in order to construct the reality around us. As information spontaneously emerges from the emptiness we take this into account to update our view of reality. The laws of Nature are information about information and outside of it there is just darkness. This is the gateway to understanding reality.

And I finish with a quote from the Tao Te Ching, which some 2500 years earlier, seems to have beaten me to the punch-line:

The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao.

The name that can be named is not the eternal name.

The nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth.

The named is the mother of the ten thousand things.

Ever desireless, one can see the mystery.

Ever desiring, one sees the manifestations.

These two spring from the same source but differ in name; this appears as darkness.

Darkness within darkness.

The gate to all mystery.

本书阐述了这样一个观点：我们现实世界中的一切本质上都是由信息组成的。无论是生命的进化过程、社会秩序的变迁，还是量子计算机的运行原理，都可以用信息比特来解释。为了全面描述现实世界的各种新现象，我们发现需要对香农最初提出的信息概念进行扩展，将传统的比特升级为量子比特（qubits）。这种升级考虑到了量子理论中的一个基本特性：测量结果本质上具有随机性。

那么，这些量子比特究竟来自何处？量子理论给出的答案令人意想不到：这些量子比特可以凭空产生！换句话说，信息的存在并不需要任何预先存在的信息，它可以从虚无中创造出来。这一发现为解决「无需依赖更基本法则的自然规律」这一难题提供了线索。在传统认知中，我们总是需要用更基本的法则来解释当前的法则，形成一个无限递归的链条。而信息的这种可以从虚无中产生的特性打破了这种无限递归。这种源自量子理论的独特属性，使得信息区别于物质或能量等其他可能统一现实世界观的概念。这使得信息成为了真正独一无二的存在。

从信息的角度来看待现实，让我们发现了其演化过程中存在两种相互竞争的趋势。这两种趋势，我们可以称之为「箭头」，它们相互配合但方向相反。第一个箭头通过对抗热力学第二定律（Second Law of thermodynamics）来组织世界的秩序，它将宇宙中自发产生的所有信息压缩成一系列清晰的基本法则。而第二个箭头则基于这些法则构建起我们对现实的认知。

显然，我们在压缩这些自发产生的信息时越有效率，就能越快地拓展我们对现实可能性的理解。但如果没有第二个箭头，也就是说没有对现实的基本认知，我们就无法开始描述宇宙。对于那些在我们现实认知中没有对应基础的宇宙部分，我们无法理解它们。因为任何超出我们现实认知范围的事物对我们而言都是未知的。我们甚至不知道有什么是我们不知道的。

让我们尝试跳出已知的范围，探索未知领域。假设第二个箭头（也就是形成我们现实认知的那个过程）会以某种方式影响第一个箭头 —— 也就是说，影响我们如何压缩从宇宙中获得的信息。这种相互影响的关系一直是推动我们认知世界发展的关键，这并不难理解。我们通过探索现实世界，逐步提升了寻找和压缩宇宙信息的能力。而这种能力的提升又反过来改变了我们对现实的认知。我们所理解的一切，我们获得的每一点知识，都是这两个箭头相互作用的结果。从生命的繁衍、天体物理学、经济学到量子力学，所有这些认知都来自于我们不断更新对现实的理解。因此我们可以清楚地看到，不仅第二个箭头依赖于第一个箭头，第一个箭头也必然依赖于第二个箭头。

但如果这两个箭头确实相互依存，这种关系会将我们引向何方呢？答案恐怕并不明确。这两个箭头都无法独立存在，每一个都在某种程度上受制于另一个。当初始的对称性被打破，我们从虚无中获得信息的那一刻起，这两个箭头就开始在一个不断循环的过程中运作：我们压缩信息形成自然法则，然后利用这些法则产生更多的信息，这些新的信息又被压缩，形成更完善的自然法则。

这两个箭头的运动是由人类探索宇宙的内在动力推动的。随着我们不断深入研究现实世界，我们希望能够更好地理解宇宙的本质。我们认为宇宙有其独立的运行规律，而热力学第二定律告诉我们，宇宙中的信息量在不断增加。但如果通过第二个箭头（也就是形成我们现实认知的过程），我们能够影响宇宙的某些方面并创造新的信息呢？这意味着，我们的存在本身可能会影响我们所处的宇宙。如此一来，我们产生的信息就会成为热力学第二定律所述的新信息的一部分。

在我们的理论框架中，这种情况并不会造成概念上的矛盾。这些新产生的信息同样可以被第一个箭头所处理，因为它会通过不断提出假设并验证的方式，努力将所有新信息整合到基本的自然法则中。但是，我们不禁要问：宇宙中是否存在其他信息，还是说所有信息都来自于我们在创造自己的现实过程中产生的信息？

这个问题引发了一个令人震撼的可能性：如果量子力学中观察到的宇宙随机性实际上是我们创造现实过程的结果，那么某种程度上我们就像是在创造自己的世界。这就像我们生活在一个模拟程序中，这个程序正在生成我们以及我们所见的一切。这让人想起电影《黑客帝国》（The Matrix)：主角基努·里维斯（Keanu Reeves）生活在一个虚拟世界中，直到他获得了逃离的机会，可以回到真实世界。但如果宇宙的随机性确实源于我们自己创造现实的过程，那么我们就没有这样的「逃生出口」。因为从根本上说，我们就是这个模拟的创造者。在这种情况下，就像里维斯醒来后发现自己正坐在电脑前编写自己所处的模拟程序。正如物理学家 John Wheeler 所说的那句话：「物理学带来了观察者的参与；观察者的参与产生了信息；而信息又产生了物理学。」

但现实是否是一个自我运行的模拟系统（因此不需要外部宇宙的存在），这是一个我们永远无法验证的问题。根据本书所阐述的观点，我们能够确定的是：在我们认知的现实之外，不存在任何我们能够理解的宇宙描述方式，只有虚无。这意味着不存在所谓的终极法则或超自然力量 —— 因为它们都将存在于我们现实之外的未知领域中。在我们的现实中，一切都是通过关系网络相互连接的，而这个网络的基本单元就是信息比特。我们通过处理、整合和观察这些信息来构建我们周围的现实世界。当信息从虚无中自然产生时，我们就将其融入到我们对现实的理解中。自然法则本质上是关于信息的信息，在它之外只存在未知。这就是我们理解现实的关键。

最后，我想引用中国古代哲学经典《道德经》中的一段话，有趣的是，这段文字似乎在 2500 年前就揭示了与本书相似的洞见：

道可道，非常道。

名可名，非常名。

无名天地之始，

有名万物之母。

故常无欲，以观其妙；

常有欲，以观其徼。

此两者同出而异名，

同谓之玄。

玄之又玄，

众妙之门。
