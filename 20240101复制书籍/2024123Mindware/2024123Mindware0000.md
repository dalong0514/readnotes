## Preface: About Mindware

“Mindware” (the term) is just a convenient label for that unruly rag-bag of stuff we intuitively count as *mental*. Beliefs, hopes, fears, thoughts, reasoning, imagery, feelings—the list is long and the puzzle is deep. The puzzle is, just what is all this stuff with which we populate our minds? What are beliefs, thoughts, and reasons, and how do they take their place among the other things that make up the natural world?

*Mindware* (the book) is written with these three aims in (of course) mind: To introduce some of the research programs that are trying (successfully, I believe) to locate the place of mindfulness in nature. To do so briefly, by sketching the major elements of key research programs, and then prompting the reader to accessible original sources for the full flesh and fire. And, above all, to do so challengingly, by devoting the bulk of the treatment to short, substantive critical discussions that try to touch some deep and tender nerves and that reach out to include front-line research in both cognitive science and philosophy.

The idea, in short, is to provide just enough of a sketch of the central research programs to then initiate and pursue a wide range of critical discussions of the conceptual terrain. These discussions do not pretend to be unbiased, exhaustive, or even to cover all the ground of a standard introductory text (although the material in the two appendices goes a little way toward filling in some gaps). Instead, the goal is to highlight challenging or problematic issues in a way likely to engage the reader in active debate. Each chapter opens with a brief sketch of a research tradition or perspective, followed by short critical discussions of several key issues. Areas covered include artificial intelligence (A.I.), connectionism, neuroscience, robotics, dynamics, and artificial life, while discussion ranges across both standard philosophical territory (levels of description, types of explanation, mental causation, the nature and the status of folk psychology) and the just-visible conceptual landscape of cutting edge cognitive science (emergence, the interplay between perception, cognition, and action, the relation between life and mind, mind as an inintrinsically embodied and environmentally embedded phenomena). If these terms seem alien and empty, don’t worry. They are just placeholders for the discussions to come.

The text has, deliberately, a rather strong narrative structure. I am telling a story about the last three or four decades of research into the nature of mind. It is a story told from a specific perspective, that of a philosopher, actively engaged in work and conversation with cognitive scientists, and especially engaged with work in artificial neural networks, cognitive neuroscience, robotics, and embodied, situated cognition. The narrative reflects these engagements and is thus dense where many are skimpy and (at times) skimpy where others are dense. I embrace this consequence, because I hope that my peculiar combination of interests affords a useful and perhaps less frequently encountered route into many of the central topics and discussions. I hope that the text will be useful in both basic and more advanced level courses both in philosophy of mind and in the various cognitive sciences.

The project is clearly ambitious, taking the reader all the way from the first waves of artificial intelligence through to contemporary neuroscience, robotics, and the coadaptive dance of mind, culture, and technology. In pushing an introductory text to these outer limits, I am betting on one thing: that a good way to introduce people to a living discussion is to make them a part of it and not hide the dirty laundry. There is much that is unclear, much that is ill understood, and much that will, no doubt, soon prove to be mistaken. There are places where it is not yet clear what the right questions are, let alone the answers. But the goal is worthy—a better understanding of ourselves and of the place of human thought in the natural order. The modest hope is just to engage the new reader in an ongoing quest and to make her part of this frustrating, fascinating, multivoiced conversation.

A word of caution in closing. Philosophy of cognitive science has something of the flavor of a random walk on a rubber landscape. No one knows quite where they are going, and every step anyone takes threatens to change the whole of the surrounding scenery. There is, shall we say, flux. So if you find these topics interesting, do, do check out the current editions of the journals, and visit some web sites. You’ll be amazed how things change.

[1] Sites change rapidly, so it is unwise to give lists. A better bet is to search using key words such as philosophy, cognitive science, and connectionism. Or ask your tutor for his or her favorite sites. Useful journals include Minds and Machines, Cognitive Science, Behavioral and Brain Sciences (hard), Mind and Language (rather philosophical), Philosophical Psychology, Connection Science (technical), and Journal of Consciousness Studies. Also mainstream philosophy journals such as Mind, Journal of Philosophy, and Synthese. The journal Trends in Cognitive Sciences is a particularly useful source of user-friendly review articles, albeit one in which explicitly philosophical treatments are the exception rather than the rule.

## Introduction: (Not) Like a Rock

Here's how January 21，2000 panned out for three different elements of the natural order.

让我们来看看在 2000 年 1 月 21 日这一天，自然界中三种不同事物经历了什么。

Element 1: A Rock

Here is a day in the life of a small, gray-white rock nestling amidst the ivy in my St. Louis backyard. It stayed put. Some things happened to it: there was rain, and it became wet and shiny; there was wind, and it was subtly eroded; my cat chased a squirrel nearby, and this made the rock sway. That’s about it, really. There is no reason to believe the rock had any thoughts, or that any of this felt like anything to the rock. Stuff happened, but that was all.

事物之一：一块岩石

让我来讲述一块安卧在我圣路易斯后院常春藤中的小小灰白色岩石的一天。它始终静静地躺在那里。周遭发生了一些变化：雨水打湿了它，让它变得晶莹闪亮；风轻轻地吹过，细微地侵蚀着它的表面；我家的猫在附近追逐松鼠时，让它轻轻摇晃。就这样平淡地过去了一天。我们没有任何理由认为这块岩石会有什么想法，或是对这些发生的事情有任何感知。事情就这样发生了，仅此而已。

Element 2: A Cat

Lolo, my cat, had a rather different kind of day. About 80% of it was spent, as usual, asleep. But there were forays into the waking, wider world. Around 7 A.M. some inner stirring led Lolo to exit the house, making straight for the catflap from the warm perch of the living room sofa. Outside, bodily functions doubtless dominated, at least at first. Later, following a brief trip back inside (unerringly routed via the catflap and the food tray), squirrels were chased and dangers avoided. Other cats were dealt with in ways appropriate to their rank, station, girth, and meanness. There was a great deal of further sleeping.

元素 2：一只猫

我家的猫 Lolo 今天过得有点特别。跟平常一样，它有大约 80% 的时间都在睡大觉。不过它偶尔也会清醒过来，到外面的世界转转。大约早上 7 点，不知道是什么想法驱使它从温暖舒适的客厅沙发起身，径直跑向猫门出去了。到了外面，它首先肯定是要解决一下生理需求。之后，它短暂地回到屋里（准确无误地穿过猫门，顺便光顾了食盘），接着又出去追逐松鼠，躲避各种危险。至于遇到其他的猫，它会根据对方的辈分、身份、体格和脾气来相应地应对。然后，当然少不了的，又是一轮酣睡。

Element 3: Myself

My day was (I think) rather more like Lolo’s than like the rock’s. We both (Lolo and I) pursued food and warmth. But my day included, I suspect, rather more outright contemplation. The kind of spiraling meta-contemplation, in fact, that has sometimes gotten philosophy a bad name. Martin Amis captured the spirit well:

要素之三：关于我自己

我觉得，我的一天更像 Lolo，而不是那块岩石。和 Lolo 一样，我们都在寻找食物和温暖。不过我想，我的一天里包含了更多纯粹的思考。这种思考是层层深入的，思考之上再思考，正是这种方式有时会让哲学背上恶名。正如 Martin Amis 准确地描述的那样：

I experienced thrilling self-pity. “What will that mind of your get up to next?” I said, recognizing the self-congratulation behind this thought and the self-congratulation behind that recognition, and the self-congratulation behind recognizing that recognition.

我陷入了一阵让人心醉神迷的自怜。"你这个脑袋瓜又要耍什么花样？」我自言自语道，随即察觉到这想法中暗藏的自鸣得意，接着又意识到自己在为察觉到这一点而沾沾自喜，更意识到自己又在为能够意识到这种沾沾自喜而洋洋得意。

Steady on. (Martin Amis, *The Rachel Papers*, p. 96)

稳住。（Martin Amis，《The Rachel Papers》，第 96 页）

I certainly did some of that. I had thoughts, even “trains of thought” (reasonable sequences of thinkings such as “It’s 1 P.M. Time to eat. What’s in the fridge?” and so on). But there were also thoughts about thoughts, as I sat back and observed my own trains of thought, alert for colorful examples to import into this text.

我确实经历过这样的时刻。我不仅有各种想法，还有「思维的串联」（trains of thought)（一些合乎逻辑的连续思考，比如「现在是下午 1 点，该吃饭了，冰箱里都有什么呢？」诸如此类）。不仅如此，当我静坐下来观察自己的思维脉络时，还会思考关于这些想法的想法，留意着可以用来充实这篇文章的生动例子。

What, then, distinguishes cat from rock, and (perhaps) person from cat? What are the mechanisms that make thought and feeling possible? And what further tricks or artifices give my own kind of mindfulness its peculiar self-aware tinge? Such questions seem to focus attention on three different types of phenomena:

究竟是什么让猫区别于石头，又是什么让人（可能）区别于猫呢？是什么样的机制让我们能够思考和感知？还有什么特殊的方式让我们人类的意识具有独特的自我觉察能力？这些问题实际上指向了三种不同的现象：

1 The feelings that characterize daily experience (hunger, sadness, desire, and so on)

2 The flow of thoughts and reasons

3 The meta-flow of thoughts about thoughts (and thoughts about feelings), of reflection on reasons, and so on.

1 构成日常生活的各种感受（如饥饿、悲伤、欲望等等)

2 思维和推理的过程

3 关于思考的思考（以及关于情感的思考）的反思过程，对原因的反思，等等。

Most of the research programs covered in this text have concentrated on the middle option. They have tried to explain how my thought that it is 1 P.M. could lead to my thought about lunch, and how it could cause my subsequent lunch-seeking actions. All three types of phenomena are, however, the subject of what philosophers call “mentalist discourse.” A typical example of mentalist discourse is the appeal to beliefs (and desires) to explain actions. The more technical phrase “propositional attitude psychology” highlights the standard shape of such explanations: such explanations pair mental attitudes (believing, hoping, fearing, etc.) with specific propositions (“that it is raining,” “that the coffee is in the kitchen,” “that the squirrel is up the tree,” etc.) so as to explain intelligent action. Thus in a sentence such as “Pepa hopes that the wine is chilled,” the that-construction introduces a proposition (“the wine is chilled”) toward which the agent is supposed to exhibit some attitude (in this case, hoping). Other attitudes (such as believing, desiring, fearing, and so on) may, of course, be taken to the same proposition. Our everyday understandings of each other’s behavior involve hefty doses of propositional attitude ascription: for example, I may explain Pepa’s reluctance to open the wine by saying “Pepa believes that the wine is not yet chilled and desires that it remain in the fridge for a few more minutes.”

本文所涵盖的大多数研究项目都着重关注第二种现象。研究者们试图解释为什么「现在是下午 1 点」这个想法会让我想到午餐，以及这个想法如何促使我随后去寻找食物。不过，这三类现象都属于哲学家所说的「心智论述（mentalistic discourse)」范畴。心智论述的一个典型例子是通过信念（和欲望）来解释行为。更专业的「命题态度心理学（propositional attitude psychology)」突出了这类解释的基本模式：这种解释方式会将各种心理状态（如相信、希望、恐惧等）进行系统性的归类和分析。

通过具体的陈述（比如「正在下雨」、「咖啡在厨房里」、「松鼠在树上」等）来解释智能行为。举个例子，当我们说「Pepa 希望酒已经冷了」这样的句子时，"that」引导的从句表达了一个具体内容（"酒已经冷了"），人们会对这个内容产生某种心理态度（在这个例子中是希望）。当然，面对同样的内容，人们也可能产生其他心理活动（比如相信、渴望、担心等）。在我们理解他人行为时，经常会用到这种心理态度的推测：比如，我可以这样解释 Pepa 为什么不想开酒："因为 Pepa 觉得酒还不够凉，想让它在冰箱里再放一会儿。"

Such ways of speaking (and thinking) pay huge dividends. They support a surprising degree of predictive success, and are the common currency of many of our social and practical projects. In this vein, the philosopher Jerry Fodor suggests that commonsense psychology is *ubiquitous*, almost *invisible* (because it works so well), and practically *indispensable*. For example, it enables us to make precise plans on the basis of someone’s 2-month-old statement that they will arrive on flight 594 on Friday, November 20, 1999. Such plans often work out—a truly amazing fact given the number of physical variables involved. They work out (when they do) because the statement reflects an intention (to arrive that day, on that flight) that is somehow an active shaper of my behavior. I desire that I should arrive on time. You know that I so desire. And on that basis, with a little cooperation from the world at large, miracles of coordination can occur. Or as Fodor more colorfully puts it:

这种说话和思考的方式确实带来了巨大的好处。它们能帮助我们在很大程度上成功地进行预测，并在我们的社会活动和实践项目中发挥着重要作用。对此，哲学家 Jerry Fodor 指出，常识心理学（commonsense psychology）是一种无处不在却又几乎难以察觉（因为它太好用了）的存在，而且在实际生活中不可或缺。举个例子，当某人在两个月前表示他们将在 1999 年 11 月 20 日星期五乘坐 594 航班到达时，我们就能够据此制定精确的接待计划。这样的计划往往能够成功实现，这真是令人惊叹，因为中间可能会出现如此多的不确定因素。之所以能够实现（在成功的情况下），是因为这个表态反映了一个明确的意图（在指定的那天乘坐特定航班到达），而这个意图会持续影响和引导说话者的行为。说话者也确实想要准时到达。

You know that I so desire. And on that basis，with a little cooperation from the world at large，miracles of coordination can occur. Or as Fodor more colorfully puts it:

众所周知，这正是我所期望的。在这个基础上，只要外部环境稍加配合，就能产生令人惊叹的协同效应。正如 Fodor 用更生动的语言所描述的那样：

> If you want to know where my physical body will be next Thursday, mechanics—our best science of middle-sized objects after all, and reputed to be pretty good in its field—is *no use to you at all*. Far the best way to find out (usually in practice, the only way to find out) is: *ask me!* (Fodor, 1987, p. 6, original emphasis)

如果你想知道下周四我的身体会在哪里，那么即便是力学 —— 这门研究常规物体的最权威科学，在其专业领域都享有盛誉 —— 也帮不上任何忙。其实，要找到答案最有效的方式（实际上往往是唯一的方式）就是：直接来问我。(Fodor，1987，p. 6，原文强调)

Commonsense psychology thus works, and with a vengeance. But why? Why is it that treating each other as having beliefs, hopes, intentions, and the like allows us successfully to explain, predict, and understand so much daily behavior? Beliefs, desires, and so on are, after all, invisible. We see (what we take to be) their effects. But no one has ever actually seen a belief. Such things are (currently? permanently?) unobservable. Commonsense psychology posits these unobservables, and looks to be committed to a body of law-like relations involving them. For example, we explain Fred’s jumping up and down by saying that he is happy because his sister just won the Nobel Prize. Behind this explanation lurks an implicit belief in a law-like regularity, viz. “if someone desires x, and x occurs, then (all other things being equal) they feel happy.” All this makes commonsense psychology look like a theory about the invisible, *but causally potent*, roots of intelligent behavior. What, then, can be making the theory true (assuming that it is)? What *is* a belief (or a hope, or a fear) such that it can cause a human being (or perhaps a cat, dog, etc.) to act in an appropriate way?

常识心理学（Commonsense psychology）确实行之有效，而且效果显著。但这是为什么呢？为什么当我们假定他人拥有信念、希望和意图等心理特征时，就能够如此准确地解释、预测和理解日常行为？毕竟，信念和欲望这些都是无形的东西，我们所能观察到的，只是我们认定是由它们产生的表现。

没有人能真正看到信念这种东西。这类事物是否仅仅是暂时无法观察，还是永远都无法观察呢？常识心理学（commonsense psychology）提出了这些无法观察的概念，并试图建立一套关于它们的规律性关系。举个例子，当我们看到 Fred 兴奋地手舞足蹈，我们会解释说这是因为他妹妹刚获得了诺贝尔奖而感到高兴。这个解释背后其实隐含着一个规律性的认知："当一个人期望某事发生，而这件事确实发生了，那么在其他条件不变的情况下，这个人就会感到高兴。」这些特征使得常识心理学看起来像是一个解释智能行为背后那些看不见却能产生实际影响的根本原因的理论。如果我们认定这个理论是正确的，那么是什么让它成为真理呢？信念（或者希望、恐惧）到底是什么，它为什么能够驱使人类（也可能包括猫、狗等动物）做出恰当的行为？

Once upon a time, perhaps, it would have been reasonable to respond to the challenge by citing a special kind of spirit-substance: the immaterial but causally empowered seat of the mental [for some critical discussion, see Churchland (1984), pp. 7–22, and Appendix I of the present text]. Our concerns, however, lie squarely with attempts that posit nothing extra—nothing beyond the properties and organization of the material brain, body, and world. The goal is a fully materialistic story in which mindware emerges as *nothing but* the playing out of ordinary physical states and processes in the familiar physical world. Insofar as the mental is in any way *special*, according to these views, it is special because it depends on some particular and unusual ways in which ordinary physical stuff can be built, arranged, and organized.

在很久以前，人们也许会认为，用一种特殊的精神实体来回应这个挑战是合理的：这种虽然非物质但具有因果作用的实体被认为是心智的栖息之所 [关于相关的批判性讨论，可参见 Churchland（1984）第 7-22 页，以及本文附录 I]。然而，我们现在的研究重点完全集中在另一种思路上：在不引入任何额外概念的前提下，仅通过物质大脑、身体和世界的属性与组织来解释这一现象。我们的目标是构建一个纯粹的唯物主义解释，在这个解释中，心智仅仅是普通物理状态和过程在我们熟悉的物理世界中自然运作的结果。按照这种观点，如果说心智有什么特别之处，那仅仅在于它依赖普通物质以特定且独特的方式被构建、排列和组织。

Views of this latter kind are broadly speaking *monistic*: that is to say, they posit only one basic *kind* of stuff (the material stuff) and attempt to explain the distinctive properties of mental phenomena in terms that are continuous with, or at least appropriately grounded in, our best understanding of the workings of the nonmental universe. A common, but still informative, comparison is with the once-lively (sic) debate between vitalists and nonvitalists. The vitalist held that living things were quite fundamentally different from the rest of inanimate nature, courtesy of a special extra force or ingredient (the “vital spark”), that was missing elsewhere. This is itself a kind of dualism. The demonstration of the fundamental unity of organic and inorganic chemistry (and the absence, in that fundament, of anything resembling a vital spark) was thus a victory—as far as we can tell—for a kind of monism. The animate world, it seems, is the result of *nothing but* the fancy combination of the same kinds of ingredients and forces responsible for inanimate nature. As it was with the animate, so materialists (which is to say, nearly all those working in contemporary cognitive science, the present author included) believe it must be with the mental. The mental world, it is anticipated, must prove to depend on nothing but the fancy combination and organization of ordinary physical states and processes.

从宏观角度来看，后一种观点属于一元论（monism)：即它只承认一种基本的物质存在，并试图用与我们对非精神世界的最佳理解相一致或至少建立在这种理解基础上的方式来解释心理现象的特殊性质。

这种观点可以用一个常见但很有启发性的例子来说明：那就是曾经激烈的活力论者和非活力论者之间的争论。活力论者认为，生命体与无生命的自然界有着本质的区别，这种区别源于一种特殊的额外力量或要素（即所谓的「vital spark」生命火花），而这种力量在其他地方是不存在的。这本身就是一种二元论。然而，有机化学和无机化学的本质统一性得到证明（而且在本质上并未发现任何类似生命火花的东西）标志着 - 就我们目前所知 - 一元论的胜利。看来，有生命的世界不过是由构成无生命自然界的相同成分和力量以复杂方式组合而成的结果。

物质主义者（也就是包括本文作者在内的几乎所有当代认知科学研究者）认为，精神世界也必然遵循同样的规律。可以预见，精神世界终将被证明只不过是普通物理状态和过程以特定方式组合和组织的产物。

Notice, then, the problem. The mental certainly *seems* special, unusual, and different. Indeed, as we saw, it *is* special, unusual, and different: thoughts give way to other thoughts and actions in a way that *respects reasons*: the thought that the forecast was sun (to adapt the famous but less upbeat example) causes me to apply sunscreen, to don a Panama hat, and to think “just another day in paradise.” And there is a qualitative feel, a “something it is like” to have a certain kind of mental life: I *experience* the stabbings of pain, the stirrings of desire, the variety of tastes, colors, and sounds. It is the burden of materialism to somehow get to grips with these various special features in a way that is continuous with, or appropriately grounded in, the way we get to grips with the rest of the physical world—by some understanding of material structure, organization, and causal flow. This is a tall order, indeed. But, as Jerry Fodor is especially fond of pointing out, there is at least one good idea floating around—albeit one that targets just one of the two special properties just mentioned: reason-respecting flow.

让我们注意到这个问题。心智现象确实显得特殊、不寻常且与众不同。事实上，正如我们所见，它的确具有这些特点：我们的思维会依据理性而转向其他思维和行动。比如说，当我想到天气预报是晴天时（这是改编自一个著名但不那么乐观的例子），这个想法会促使我涂防晒霜、戴上巴拿马帽，并想着「又是一个完美的日子」。

同时，特定的心智活动还具有一种定性体验，也就是「体验是什么感觉」的维度：我们能感受到疼痛的刺痛、欲望的涌动，以及各种味道、颜色和声音带来的体验。唯物主义面临的挑战在于：如何用我们理解其他物质世界的方式 —— 即通过理解物质结构、组织和因果关系 —— 来解释这些特殊的心智特征，使之与物质世界的认知保持连续或建立恰当的联系。

这确实是个艰巨的任务。但是，正如 Jerry Fodor 特别喜欢指出的，我们至少已经有了一个好的思路 —— 尽管这个思路只针对我们刚才提到的两个特殊属性中的一个：即符合理性的思维流动过程。

The idea, in a supercompressed nutshell, is that the power of a thought (e.g., that the forecast is sun) to cause further thoughts and actions (to apply sunscreen, to think “another day in paradise”) is fully explained by what are broadly speaking *structural* properties of the system in which the thought occurs. By a structural property I here mean simply a physical or organizational property: something whose nature is explicable *without* invoking the specific thought-content involved. An example will help. Consider the way a pocket calculator outputs the sum of two numbers given a sequence of button pushings that we interpret as inputting “2”
“+” “2.” The calculator need not (and does not) understand anything about numbers for this trick to work. It is simply structured so that those button pushings will typically lead to the output “4” as surely as a river will typically find the path of least resistance down a mountain. It is just that in the former case, but not the latter, there has been a process of design such that the physical stuff became organized so as its physical unfoldings would reflect the arithmetical constraints governing sensible (arithmetic-respecting) transitions in number space. Natural selection and lifetime learning, to complete the (supercompressed) picture, are then imagined to have sculpted our brains so that certain structure-based physical unfoldings respect the constraints on sensible sequences of thoughts and sensible thought–action transitions. Recognition of the predator thus causes running, hiding, and thoughts of escape, whereas recognition of the food causes eating, vigilance, and thoughts of where to find more. Our whole reason-respecting mental life, so the story goes, is just the unfolding of what is, at bottom, a physical and structural story. Mindfulness is just matter, nicely orchestrated.

简而言之，这个观点是这样的：当我们产生一个想法（比如看到天气预报是晴天），进而引发后续的想法和行动（比如涂防晒霜，或想着「真是个完美的日子」），这整个过程完全可以用系统的基本结构特性来解释。所谓结构特性，就是指物理或组织上的特性：它们的本质可以不需要牵涉到具体的思维内容就能得到解释。

让我们用一个例子来说明。想想袖珍计算器是如何在我们按下「2」「+」「2」这几个按键后得出结果的。计算器本身并不需要（事实上也不能）理解数字的含义就能完成这个运算。它只是按照特定方式构建的，就像河水必然会顺着山间阻力最小的路径流下去一样，这些按键操作必然会得到「4」这个结果。不同的是，计算器经过了精心设计，使其物理结构能够体现数学运算规则，确保在数字运算中得到正确的结果。

在这个简化的模型中，自然选择和终身学习的过程被认为塑造了我们的大脑，使其结构能够产生符合逻辑的思维过程和相应的行为反应。这就解释了为什么当我们看到捕食者时会本能地产生跑、躲的行为和逃生的想法，而看到食物时则会进食、保持警觉并思考在哪里能找到更多。按照这种观点，我们所有符合逻辑的心理活动，本质上都是一个物理和结构性的过程的展现。换句话说，我们的意识本质上就是经过精妙组织的物质的体现。

(As to that other distinctive property, “qualitative feel,” let’s just say—and see Appendix II—that it’s a problem. Maybe that too is just a property of matter, nicely orchestrated. But how the orchestration yields the property is in this case much less clear, even in outline. So we’ll be looking where the light is.)

(关于另一个独特的属性 ——「质性体验」（qualitative feel），让我们这样说吧（详见附录二）：这确实是个难题。也许这也仅仅是物质的一种属性，只是以某种精妙的方式被组织起来。但在这种情况下，我们对于这种组织方式如何产生这种属性的理解还很模糊，连基本轮廓都不清晰。因此，我们将选择从已知的领域开始研究。）

In the next eight chapters, I shall expand and pursue that simple idea of mindware (selected aspects!) as matter, nicely orchestrated. The chase begins with a notion of mind as a kind of souped-up pocket calculator (mind as a familiar kind of computer, but built out of meat rather than silicon). It proceeds to the vision of mind as dependent on the operation of a radically different kind of computational device (the kind known as artificial neural networks). And it culminates in the contemporary (and contentious) research programs that highlight the complex interactions among brains, bodies, and environmental surroundings (work on robotics, artificial life, dynamics, and situated cognition).

在接下来的八个章节中，我将展开并深入探讨这样一个简单观点：心智软件（mindware，仅限特定方面）是如何作为物质被精妙地组织起来的。这段探索之旅始于一个基础概念：将心智比作一个高级版的便携式计算器（也就是说，心智像是一台我们熟悉的计算机，只不过其构建材料是生物组织而非硅基材料）。接着，我们将探讨心智如何依赖于一种完全不同类型的计算设备（即人工神经网络）的运作。最终，我们将讨论当代一些颇具争议的研究项目，这些项目主要关注大脑、身体与环境之间的复杂互动关系（包括机器人学、人工生命、动力学和情境认知等领域的研究）。

The narrative is, let it be said, biased. It reflects my own view of what we have learned in the past 30 or 40 years of cognitive scientific research. What we have learned, I suggest, is that there are many deeply different ways to put flesh onto that broad, materialistic framework, and that some once-promising incarnations face deep and unexpected difficulties. In particular, the simple notion of the brain as a kind of symbol-crunching computer is probably too simple, and too far removed from the neural and ecological realities of complex, time-critical interaction that sculpted animal minds. The story I tell is thus a story of (a kind of) inner symbol flight. But it is a story of progress, refinement, and renewal, not one of abandonment and decay. The sciences of the mind are, in fact, in a state of rude health, of exuberant flux. Time, then, to start the story, to seek the origins of mind in the whirr and buzz of well-orchestrated matter.

坦白说，这个论述是带有个人色彩的。它体现了我对过去三四十年认知科学研究成果的个人见解。在我看来，我们已经认识到，在这个宏大的唯物主义框架下可以有多种深层次的诠释方式，而一些曾经被看好的理论模型却遭遇到了深刻且始料未及的挑战。尤其是把大脑简单地比作一台处理符号的计算机，这种观念可能过于简单化了，它与塑造动物心智的复杂的、时序敏感的神经和生态互动的现实相去甚远。因此，我要讲述的是一个关于（某种）内在符号演化的故事。但这是一个关于进步、升华和革新的故事，而不是一个关于放弃和衰落的故事。事实上，心智科学正处于一个蓬勃发展、充满活力的黄金时期。现在，让我们开始这个故事，在有序运作的物质世界的律动中，探寻心智的起源。

## Resources

Each chapter ends with specific suggestions for further reading. But it is also worth highlighting a number of basic resources and collections:

Bechtel, W., and Graham, G. (1998). *A Companion to Cognitive Science*. Oxford, England: Blackwell. (Encyclopedia-style entries on all the important topics, with a useful historical introduction by Bechtel, Abrahamsen, and Graham.)

Boden, M. (1990). *The Philosophy of Artificial Intelligence*. Oxford, England: Oxford University Press. (Seminal papers by Turing, Searle, Newell and Simon, and Marr, with some newer contributions by Dennett, Dreyfus and Dreyfus, P.M. Churchland, and others.)

Boden, M. (1996). *The Philosophy of Artificial Life*. Oxford, England: Oxford University Press. (Nice introductory essay by Langton, and a useful window on some early debates in this area.)

Haugeland, J. (1997). *Mind Design II*. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. (Fantastic collection, including a fine introduction by Haugeland; seminal papers by Turing, Dennett, Newell and Simon, Minsky, Dreyfus, and Searle; a comprehensive introduction to connectionism in papers by Rumelhart, Smolensky, Churchland, Rosenberg, and Clark, seminal critiques by Fodor and Pylyshyn, Ramsey, Stich, and Garon; and a hint of new frontiers from Brooks and Van Gelder. Quite indispensable.)

Lycan, W. (1990). *Mind and Cognition: A Reader*. Cambridge, MA: Blackwell. (Great value—a large and well-chosen collection concentrating on the earlier debates over functionalism, instrumentalism, eliminativism, and the language of thought, with a useful section on consciousness and qualia.)

MacDonald, C., and MacDonald, G. (1995). *Connectionism: Debates on Psychological Explanation*. Oxford, England: Blackwell. (A comprehensive sampling of the debates between connectionism and classicism, with contributions by Smolensky, Fodor and Pylyshyn (and replies by each), Ramsey et al., Stich and Warfield, and many others.)

Two recent *textbooks* have contents that nicely complement the present, cognitive scientifically oriented, perspective:

Braddon-Mitchel, D., and Jackson, F. (1996). *Philosophy of Mind and Cognition*. Oxford, England: Blackwell. (Excellent introductory text covering the more traditionally philosophical territory of identity theory, functionalism, and debates about content.

Kim, J. (1996). *Philosophy of Mind*. Boulder, CO: Westview. (A truly excellent text, covering behaviorism, identity theory, machine functionalism, and debates about consciousness and content.)
