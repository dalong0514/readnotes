THE OPTICAL INFORMATION

FOR SELF-PERCEPTION

It has frequently been assumed in previous chapters that the point of observation for an ambient optic array is not occupied. The point has been thought of as a position at which observation could be made, a position that could be occupied but need not be. Such a position could just as well be occupied by another observer and, since all positions can be occupied by any observer, the invariants of the array under locomotion can be shared by all observers. It was important to establish this principle that the point of observation is public, not private, but now we must consider the other side of the coin. When a point of observation is occupied, there is also optical information to specify the observer himself, and this information cannot be shared by other observers. For the body of the animal who is observing temporarily conceals some portion of the environment in a way that is unique to that animal. I call this information propriospecific as distinguished from exterospecific, meaning that it specifies the self as distinguished from the environment.

The Specifying of the Self by the Field of View

The field of view of an animal, as I will use the term, is the solid angle of the ambient light that can be registered by its ocular system. The field of view, unlike the ambient array, is bounded; it is a sort of sample of the whole sphere. The angular scope of the field of view depends on the placement of the eyes in the head, some animals having lateral eyes and a nearly panoramic field of view and others having frontal eyes and a roughly hemispherical field of view (Walls, 1942，Ch. 10). Horses belong to the first group and humans to the second. In both ocular systems, the separate fields of view of the two eyes overlap in front, but the amount of overlap is very much greater in humans than it is in animals with semipanoramic vision. By the field of view, I mean the combined fields of view of the two eyes. The Optical Information for Self-Perception 105

An attempt is made in Figure 7.1 to show a cross-section of the field of view of the left orbit of a human observer. If the reader will put his or her left eve close to the page, one gets an approximation of the sample of the ambient light that the illustrator could see with his head still and his right eye closed. The illustrator was reclining, with his feet up, facing the corner of a room. His nose, lips, and cheek and part of his left arm are represented. The drawing is an updating of one made by Ernst Mach in the 1880s that he entitled "The Visual Ego." What is being illustrated here is the stationary field of view of an eye socket with the head fixed and the eye mobile, not the shifting field of view with a fixed eve and a turning head: the latter is different and will be described later. For this drawing, the artist had to turn his eye in order to see clearly the peripheral details in the field of view.

A field of view is a large visual solid angle, with an envelope. The important fact about a field of view is its boundaries. vague and indefinite boundaries. to be sure, but still boundaries. They are in some ways like occluding edges, the occluding edges of a window. The edges of the field of view hide the environ- ment behind them. as those of a window do. and when the field moves there is an accretion of optical structure at the leading edge with deletion of structure at the trailing edge, as in the cabin of a steam shovel with a wide front window and controls that enable the operator to turn the cabin to the right or the left. But the edges of the field of view are unlike the edges of a window inasmuch as, for the window, a foreground hides the background whereas, for the field of view, the head of the observer hides the background. Ask yourself what it is that you see hiding the surroundings as you look out upon the world-not darkness surely, not air, not nothing, but the ego! The illustration of course is misleading in this respect.

Whenever a point of observation is occupied by a human, about half of the surrounding world is revealed to the eyes and the remainder is concealed by the head. What is concealed is occluded not by a surface, a projected surface of the sort described when the laws of occluding and occluded surfaces were formulated, but by a unique entity. It is not a part of the world, but it does conform to the principle of reversible occlusion, by which those surfaces that go out of sight with one movement come back into sight with the opposite movement. The head turns. and whatever was in back of the head at one time will be in front of the head at another and vice versa. This fact is fundamental for the theory of perception to be proposed. The purpose of vision, I shall argue, is to be aware of the surroundings, the ambient environment, not merely of the field in front of the eyes. The ambient information is always available to any observer who turns his or her head. Visual perception is panoramic and, over time, the panorama is registered.

There are other remarkable features of the field of view besides its oval boundaries. Still other occluding edges appear within it, those of the nose, the body, the limbs, and the extremities, some of which can be seen in the drawing. The edges of the eye socket, the eyebrows, the nose and cheek bones are only the nearest: the edges of the arms. legs. hands. and feet are more distant. but FIGURE 7.1 The ego as seen by the left eye. The temporary field of view of the left orbit of an observer. (From The Perception of the Visual World by James Jerome Gibson and used with the agreement of the reprint publisher, Greenwood Press,

Inc.) The Optical Information for Self-Perception 107 they still occlude the surfaces of the "outer"environment. The hands and feet behave more like the occluding edges of an object than like the occluding edges of a window; they are actually protrusions into the field of view from below. They are therefore attached objects in the present terminology, but they are attached to the observer, not to the ground, and they are elastic. When these semiobjects move, there is deletion of optical structure at the leading edge and accretion at the trailing edge, just as with objects in the world.

Information exists in a normal ambient array, therefore, to specify the near- ness of the parts of the self to the point of observation-first the head, then the body, the limbs, and the extremities. The experience of a central self in the head and a peripheral self in the body is not therefore a mysterious intuition or a philosophical abstraction but has a basis in optical information.

I have described this information for perceiving the self in terms applicable to a human observer, but the description could be applied to an animal without too much change. In all bilaterally symmetrical animals, the eyes are in the head, the head is attached to a body, and (for terrestrial animals) the body is supported by the ground. But the horse and the human look out upon the world in different ways. They have radically different fields of view; their noses are different, and their legs are different, entering and leaving the field of view in different ways. Each species sees a different self from every other. Each indi- vidual sees a different self. Each person gets information about his or her body that differs from that obtained by any other person.

THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE FIELD OF VIEW

AND THE VISUAL FIELD

The field of view being described here should not be confused with the

visual field. As I used the term, the visual field means a kind of introspective

experience contrasted with the naive experience of the visual world (Gibson,

1950b, Ch. 3). It is the momentary patchwork of visual sensations. But the

field of view is a fact of ecological optics.

Actually, there are always two fields of view available to any animal with

two eyes. That is, there are two ambient optic arrays at two different points

of observation, each of which is sampled by one eye. Since the points of

observation are separated by the interocular distance, the optic arrays are

different. I term this difference disparity, by analogy with the retinal disparity

studied so intensively by physiological image optics.

The difference between the disparity of two array samples and the

disparity of two retinal images is considerable. The difference between a

theory of disparity as information and the traditional theory of the "fusion"

of disparate images is radical. There will be more of this later, especially in

Chapters 11 and 12. 108 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

Nonvisual Information about The self

It is obvious, of course, that perceptual systems other than the visual system are active and that the body is a source of stimulus information for these other so-called senses as well as for vision. Proprioception is either taken to be one of the senses by sensory physiologists or taken to be several related senses, as conceived by Sir Charles Sherrington. A deep theoretical muddle is connected with proprioception. I tried to clear it up in my book on the perceptual systems (Gibson, 1966b) by reformulating the whole meaning of the term sense. In my view, proprioception can be understood as egoreception, as sensitivity to the self, not as one special channel of sensations or as several of them. I maintain that all the perceptual systems are propriosensitive as well as exterosensitive, for they all provide information in their various ways about the observer's activ- ities. The observer's movements usually produce sights and sounds and impres- sions on the skin along with stimulation of the muscles, the joints, and the inner ear. Accordingly, information that is specific to the self is picked up as such, no matter what sensory nerve is delivering impulses to the brain. The point I wish to make is that information about the self is multiple and that all kinds are picked up concurrently. An individual not only sees himself, he hears his foot- steps and his voice, he touches the floor and his tools, and when he touches his own skin he feels both his hand and his skin at the same time. He feels his head turning, his muscles flexing, and his joints bending. He has his own aches, the pressures of his own clothing, the look of his own eyeglasses-in fact, he lives within his own skin.

This theory of information for self-perception, it should be noted, contra- dicts one of the most deep-seated assumptions of traditional sensory physi- ology-the doctrine that a neural input can be specific only to the receptor that initiated it, that is, the doctrine of the specific qualities of the nerves, or specific "nerve energies" as Johannes Müller called them. According to this doctrine, proprioception is ascribed to specialized proprioceptors. But I have rejected this theory of specificity and substituted another that is quite radically different.

Egoreception and Exteroception are Inseparable

The optical information to specify the self, including the head, body, arms, and hands, accompanies the optical information to specify the environment. The two sources of information coexist. The one could not exist without the other. When a man sees the world, he sees his nose at the same time; or rather, the world and his nose are both specified and his awareness can shift. Which of the two he notices depends on his attitude; what needs emphasis now is that information is available for both.

The supposedly separate realms of the subjective and the objective are actually only poles of attention. The dualism of observer and environment is unnecessary. The Optical Information for Self-Perception 109 The information for the perception of "here"is of the same kind as the inform- ation for the perception of "there,"and a continuous layout of surfaces extends from one to the other. This fact can be noted in Figure 7.1. What I called gradients in 1950，the gradients of increasing density of texture, of increasing binocular disparity, and of decreasing motility that specify increasing distance all the way from the observer's nose out to the horizon, are actually variables between two limits, implying just this complementarity of proprioception and exteroception in perception. Self-perception and environment perception go together.

WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE HEAD IS TILTED?

In a chapter entitled "The Problem of the Stable and Boundless Visual World"

(Gibson, 1950), I put the question of why, when one tilts the head, the world

does not appear to tilt but remains visibly upright. Is it now clear that the

question was misconceived? It has long been a puzzle for theories of visual

perception based on the input from the retina. No satisfactory answer has

been agreed upon. (Psychology is plagued with efforts to find answers to the

wrong questions!)

What happens when your head is tilted is simply that you are aware of it.

The change of retinal stimulation is exactly concomitant with changes in the

stimulation coming from muscles and joints and from the inner ear, and

these all specify the same fact. The tilt of the retina behind the normal retinal

image is observed, whereas the tilt of a hypothetical pattern of input relative

to the receptor mosaic is not noticed. Why should it be? Curious anomalies

will arise, to be sure, if the information got by the visual system is discrepant

with that obtained by the muscle-joint system, or the vestibular system, for

then the observer is uncertain what to mean by the word tilt; he is confused,

and the results of the experiment are open to many interpretations.

Efforts to answer the question of why the world looks upright, stable, and

unbounded despite all the vicissitudes of the retinal input are still going on.

Up-to-date knowledge of this research can be obtained by reading Stability

and Constancy in Visual Perception (Epstein, 1977). This is an admirable book

if you accept its premises.

The Information for the Perceiving of Distance

The problem of how distance can be perceived is very old. If it is taken to be the distance of an object in space, then it is "a line endwise to the eye," as Bishop Berkeley pointed out in 1709, and it projects only one point on the retina. Hence, distance of itselfis invisible and, if so, a whole set of perplexities arise that have never been resolved. Distance may be thought of, however, as extending 110 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

along the ground instead of through the air, and then it is not invisible. It is projected as a gradient of the decreasing optical size and increasing optical density of the features of the ground, as I argued in 1950. But this gradient of forms getting smaller and finer and more closely packed together has a limit at the horizon of the earth where, according to the laws of natural perspective, all visual solid angles shrink to zero. The gradient is also anchored at another limit, by the forms projected from the nose, body, and limbs. The nose projects at the maximum of nearness just as the horizon projects at the maximum of farness.

Distance therefore is not a line endwise to the eye as Bishop Berkeley thought. To think so is to confuse abstract geometrical space with the living space of the environment. It is to confuse the Z-axis of a Cartesian coordinate system with the number of paces along the ground to a fixed object.

The nose is here. It projects the largest possible visual solid angle in the optic array. Not only that, it provides the maximum of crossed double imagery or crossed disparity in the dual array, for it is the farthest possible edge to the right in the left eye's field of view and the farthest possible edge to the left in the right eye's field of view. This also says that to look at the nose one must converge the two eyes maximally. Finally, the so-called motion parallax of the nose is an absolute maximum, which is to say that, of all the occluding edges in the world, the edge of the nose sweeps across the surfaces behind it at the greatest rate whenever the observer moves or turns his head. For each of the three kinds of optical gradient that I proposed as "stimuli" for seeing depth in The Perception of the Visual World (Gibson, 19506)-size perspective, disparity perspective, and motion perspective- the nose provides an absolute base line, the absolute zero of distance-from-here. The Specifying of Head Turning

The head can be turned as well as displaced. Turning the head is looking around; displacing it is locomotion. The head can be turned on a vertical axis as in looking from side to side, on a horizontal axis as in looking up and down, and even on a sagittal axis as in tilting the head. The sky will always enter the field in looking up, and the ground will always enter the field in looking down. Three pairs of semicircular canals in the vestibule of the inner ear, set in place relative to the three axes, register these turns and specify the degree of head rotation. This fact is well known and has been widely studied. What is not so familiar is the fact that these turns of the head are also registered by vision. They are specified by what I have called the sweeping of the field of view over the ambient array during head turns and the wheeling of the field over the array during head tilts. The sweeping and wheeling of this window with its special private occluding edges are not simply "motions"but deletions and accretions of optical structure. To say only that the field of view "moves"over the world as the head moves is inexact and insufficient; the world is revealed and concealed as the head moves, in ways that specify exactly how the head moves. Whatever goes out of The Optical Information for Self-Perception 111 sight as the head turns right comes into sight as the head turns left; whatever goes out of sight as the head is lifted comes into sight as the head is lowered. The optical texture that is deleted is subsequently accreted. It is invariant under this reversible optical change. It conforms to the principle of reversible occlusion.

The temporary field of view of an eye socket is a sample of the ambient optic array, and the head is continually sampling the array. Each sample is a segment that overlaps with earlier and later segments. Moreover, it is a changing segment with elements being progressively included and excluded at the margins. And in a sufficiently long sequence of these segments, the whole structure of the array is specified.

The combined field of view of two eye sockets (and all higher animals have two eyes) consists of two samples of the ambient array. They overlap more or less, more in humans than in horses, and thus the same structure is included in both segments. But it is not quite the same structure, because the two points of observation are slightly separated and there is a resulting disparity of the two structures. This disparity, or mismatch, is at a maximum for the contour projected from the edge of the animal's nose, as I pointed out above. The edge of the nose is the left-hand edge of what the right eye sees but the right-hand FIGURE 7.2 A sequence of overlapping fields of view obtained by turning the head to the right (continued overleaf).

This is the same room and the same man as in Figure 7.1, except that his feet are now lined up with the window instead of with the corner of the room. The head turns through an angle of about 90°. His nose is always at the right-hand edge of the field. The field of view is a sliding sample of the ambient array. 112 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

edge of what the left eye sees, and this maximum mismatch constitutes inform- ation for the zero of distance, that is, for the awareness of oneself at the center of a layout of surfaces receding from here. The minimum of mismatch is at the horizon. There will be more about disparity later. The Optical Information for Self-Perception 113 The Specifying of Limb Movements

Consider in more detail the protrusions into the field of view of those complex shapes with deforming outlines that are the projections of the limbs and extremities of the observer's body. They normally enter and leave the field at its lower edge, or else the field sweeps down to reveal them. They are almost never at rest. They specify objects in some ways, but of course they are only semiob- jects. I am tempted to call them subjective objects, and this paradox would emphasize the fact that no line can be drawn between the subjective and the objective. In the primate and the human, the five-pronged shapes that specify the hands are especially meaningful. Their deforming contours and the under- lying invariants make possible what psychologists have called, very inad- equately, eye-hand coordination. More exactly, they are the basis of the visual control of manipulation. And when an object grasped by the hand is used as a tool, it becomes a sort of extension of the hand, almost a part of the body

Infants, both monkey and human, practice looking at their hands for hours, as well they should, for the disturbances of optical structure that specify the niceties of prehension have to be distinguished. All manipulations, from the crudest act of grasping by the infant to the finest act of assembly by the watch- maker, must be guided by optical disturbances if they are to be successful. Some kinds of transformations and occlusions were listed in the last chapter.

The optical minification of the squirming silhouette of the hand specifies extension of the arm, reaching out, while optical magnification specifies flection of the arm, pulling in. A hand occludes progressively less of the environment as it recedes and progressively more of the environment as it approaches. A certain nonsymmetrical magnification of the hand will bring it to the mouth, as every baby learns. A symmetrical magnification of the hand will cause it to cover the eyes so that nothing can be seen. But then, of course, one can peek through the fingers, which is not only pleasurable but a lesson in practical optics.

The visual solid angle of the hand cannot be reduced below a certain minimum: the visual solid angle of a detached obiect like a ball can be made very small by throwing it. These ranges of magnification and minification between limits link up the extremes of here and out there. the body and the world, and constitute another bridge between the subjective and the objective.

You might think that contact of the hand or foot with a surface during extension of the limb is specified by a mechanical impression on the skin, by touch, and that there would be no use for an optical specification as well. Nevertheless, there is such optical specification. When the decreasing occlusion of the surface by the extremity ceases, and when there is no accretion or deletion of surface texture by the occluding edges of the hand or foot, then the extremity is in contact with the surface and not sliding over it. This specifies, for example, that the foot is on the ground. Terrestrial animals are accustomed to have their feet on the ground and to have both cutaneous and 114 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

optical information for this state of affairs. This explains why an invisible glass floor high above the real floor supplies mechanical support but not optical support, and why it is that human infants and other terrestrial animals show distress, flinching and behaving as if falling, when placed on such a transparent floor (Chapter 9).

These are a few examples of the rules that make visual egoreception so useful. The surfaces of the hands, of the tools held by the hands, and the working surfaces that they alter are all given as a changing layout of the nearby environment, the information for which is contained in the changing structure of the optic arrays at the two eyes.

The Specifying of Locomotion

At a moving point of observation no less than a stationary point of observation, the ambient array is sampled by the observer, who can look around the world while moving as well as while stationary. The edges of the observer's field of view will sweep over the flowing ambient array in the same way that they sweep over the frozen ambient array. A person can face backward while riding in a vehicle, or walk backward for that matter, and observe how the array flows inward. instead of outward as it does when one faces forward.

If we consider for the present an open environment, one that is not cluttered, locomotion is specified by flow of the array and rest by nonflow. The flow is a change in perspective structure, a change in the perspectives of the ground if outdoors and of the floor, walls, and ceiling if indoors. There is not only a static perspective of the array but also a motion perspective, as I once called it (Gibson, Olum, and Rosenblatt, 1955). This will be described, along with experiments, in Chapter 9. The main law of flowing perspective is that it is centrifugal in half the array and centripetal in the other half, but these two hemispheres are not invariant. They shift around and thus are not to be confused with the permanent hemispheres of earth and sky. More particularly, a focus of centrifugal outflow is always accompanied by another focus of centripetal inflow at the opposite pole of the sphere. This axis is the line of the displacement of the observer. Hence, the focus of expansion is the direction in which one is going, and the focus of contraction is the direction from which one is coming. This direction may change during locomotion, of course, relative to the permanent environ- ment of earth and sky, and the two foci of inflow and outflow may change correspondingly relative to other invariants of the ambient array.

I have distinguished between invariant structure and perspective structure in Chapter 5. The invariant structure of the array that specifies the persisting world underlies the changing perspective structure. The pattern of outflow and inflow is superposed, as it were, on the nonchanging features of the array. One of these non-changing features is the earth-sky contrast at the horizon, and another is the texture of the earth. The flow pattern shifts as the observer The Optical Information for Self-Perception 115 changes direction, now in one direction and then another, and reverses when the direction is reversed, but the invariants of structure and texture never shift. They specify the unmoving terrain, whereas the flow pattern specifies the observer's locomotion with reference to the terrain.

How do we see where we are going? We guide or steer our locomotion, when we are in control of it, by locating those invariant features of the array that specify a destination, whatever it may be, and then keeping the focus of optical outflow centered on that item. In short, we magnify the form that specifies the goal. A child runs to his mother by enlarging her image to the limit, that is, to the largest possible solid angle; a bee flies to a flower by precisely the same rule. The rule is related to the principle of what I have called the "symmetricalizing"of stimulation (Gibson, 1966b, pp. 72 ff.). We shall return to this problem in Part III, where we will also consider the control of locomotion to a hidden destination.

The centrifugal outflow of the array that specifies locomotion does not interfere with the information that specifies surface layout; the invariants are all the better for the transformation. The moving self and the unmoving world are reciprocal aspects of the same perception. To say that one perceives an outflow of the world ahead and an inflow of the world behind as one moves forward in the environment would be quite false. One experiences a rigid world and a flowing array. The optical flow of the ambient array is almost never perceived as motion; it is simply experienced as kinesthesis, that is egolocomotion ( Warren, 1976).

Consider, finally, an environment with hidden surfaces. An open environ- ment projects a continuous flow pattern to the eye of a moving observer, but a cluttered environment does not. The existence of occluding edges brings about the revealing and concealing of surfaces and the incrementing and decre- menting of the corresponding optical textures. This kind of change is not a flow or a transformation, because the units of the array, some of them, do not map from preceding to succeeding arrays. The invariants that specify the layout of the real environment, then, are not simply invariants under projective trans- formations. There will be more of this in Part III.

How is this optical flow related to classical kinesthesis, which is supposed to be the sense of movement? A person who walks or runs or rides a bicycle does get sensations from the muscles and joints that specify movement. All I propose is that visual kinesthesis should be recognized along with muscle-joint kines- thesis. The latter does not function during passive locomotion in a vehicle. Visual kinesthesis yields the only reliable information about displacement. The classical sense of movement is not trustworthy, for a fish in a stream and a bird in a wind have to exercise their muscles and joints strenuously merely to stay in the same place. The animal is moving in one meaning but not in another. Locomotion with respect to the earth, active or passive, is registered by vision (this will be elaborated in Chapter 10), but supplementary information about 116 The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

the movement of a limb relative to the body is picked up by the haptic system ( Gibson,1966b,Ch.4).

Summary

Information about the self accompanies information about the environment, and the two are inseparable. Egoreception accompanies exteroception, like the other side of a coin. Perception has two poles, the subjective and the objective, and information is available to specify both. One perceives the environment and coperceives oneself.

The edges of the field of view occlude the outer environment, and, as the head turns, the occlusion changes, revealing what was concealed and concealing what was revealed. The same thing happens with locomotion as with head turning. The rule is, whatever goes out of sight comes into sight, and whatever The Optical Information for Self-Perception 117 FIGURE 7.4 The outflow of the optic array from the focus of expansion on the horizon.

This is what a human flier would see looking ahead in the direction of locomotion. There is a gradient of increasing rate of flow downward from the horizon. (From The Perception of the Visual World by James Jerome Gibson and used with the agreement of the reprint publisher, Greenwood Press, Inc.)

comes into sight goes out of sight. Thus it is that a stationary and permanent environment is specified along with a moving observer, one who looks around, moves about, and does things with his hands and feet.

Three types of movement have been distinguished-head turning relative to the body, limb movement relative to the body, and locomotion relative to the environment. Each has a unique type of optical information to specify it: the sweeping of the field of view over the ambient array in the case of head turning; the protrusion of special shapes into the field of view in the case of limb movement (especially manipulation); and the flow of the ambient array in the case oflocomotion. The pickup of this information, I propose, should in all cases be called visual kinesthesis.
