摘自「2021005Implementing-Smart-Factory-of-Industrie-4.0-An-Outlook.md」2016 年 1 月发表的论文

With the emerging information technologies, such as IoT, big data, and cloud computing together with artificial intelligence technologies, we believe the smart factory of Industrie 4.0 can be implemented. The smart machines and products can communicate and negotiate with each other to reconfigure themselves for flexible production of multiple types of products. The massive data can be collected from smart artifacts and transferred to the cloud through the IWN. This enables the system-wide feedback and coordination based on big data analytics to optimize system performance. The above self-organized reconfiguration and big data based feedback and coordination define the framework and operational mechanism of the smart factory.

### 0102. 主题卡 —— 智慧工厂的 autonomy and sociality

摘自「2021005Implementing-Smart-Factory-of-Industrie-4.0-An-Outlook.md」2016 年 1 月发表的论文

From the perspective of control engineer, the smart factory can be viewed as a closedloop system, as shown in Figure 3. In the center of the control loop is the network of smart artifacts. The smart artifact has 3C capabilities, and beyond this, it has autonomy and sociality. By autonomy, we mean that the smart artifact makes decisions by itself; no other entities can directly control its behavior. By sociality, we mean that the smart artifacts understand a common set of knowledge and follow a common set of rules for negotiation. Therefore, a society of smart artifacts can yield a highly flexible manufacturing system, that is, a self-organized and reconfigurable system that seems to be humanoid or smart.

The smart artifacts are fundamental components of smart factory. While today’s computer numerical control (CNC) machines generally have 3C capabilities, the smart machines should have additional autonomy and sociality capabilities. This means the smart machines can make decisions by themselves instead of being directly instructed, and they can negotiate with each other and with the smart products. Therefore, the autonomy and sociality capabilities are the key enablers for the implementation of a self-organized manufacturing system. The research on MAS that is a branch of AI technology can provide some useful results such as the ontology method and the contract net protocol (CNP) [28]. However, further research is still needed to achieve the autonomous manufacturing system architecture instead of hierarchical or mediator ones.

Despite the success stories already discussed, it is still a long and winding road from the vision to the reality of a smart factory, but just as it is constantly being walked by the consumer product engineers, it must also be taken by the factory planners. Adopting the basic principles of the internet-of-things we should talk about a factory-of-things as a vision for our future factories. The factory-of-things will be composed of smart objects which interact based on semantic services. There will be no hierarchy in the traditional sense instead the objects will self-organize to fulﬁl a certain task. But to achieve this goal there are multi-dimensional problems to be solved.

### 0103. 主题卡 —— 智慧工厂要回答的三个问题

摘自「2021008Smart-Factory-A-Step-towards-the-Next-Generation-of-Manufacturing.md」2008 年 1 月发表的论文

The Smart Factory concept enables the real-time collection, distribution and access of manufacturing relevant information anytime and anywhere. The Smart Factory represents a realtime, context-sensitive manufacturing environment that can handle turbulences in production using decentralized information and communication structures for an optimum management of production processes. Premises for further assistance than today are the horizontal and vertical integration of information systems, the assignment of material and flow of information within an enterprise. For acting context-aware, the applications in the Smart factory have to answer the following three questions, from those deriving more challenges:

1 How is an object identified? => Identification phase

2 Where is an object located into the factory? => Positioning phase

3 What is the situation or status of an object? => Status knowledge

2『感觉这的信息就是论文的核心，智慧工厂要回答的三个问题，做一张主题卡片。（2021-01-28）』

These and further challenges are shortly presented:

Identification: The Identification of objects, as one of the basic challenges in a factory, assigns information of the virtual world like process steps to real world objects. Therefore suitable identification methods, tags, sensors, sensor readers and communication facilities have to be found and chosen, specific to their task in a rough industrial environment.

Localization: For improving the processes and reducing idle times within the Smart Factory the localization is required to have an actual knowledge about the position of the objects like tools or materials. Depending on the purpose, the accuracy of a positioning system has to be a range within 0.15-1m. Furthermore a positioning system used in a manufacturing environment has to work on a large scale and has to be robust against environmental influences, electromagnetic fields, noise of dust, etc. [3].

Status knowledge: The assistance systems in a Smart Factory have to know the status or situation of the objects in order to provide users the context-aware information.

Update of smart management systems: Current object information like the status or location has to be communicated to the systems of the Smart Factory. As an example the highly dynamical data like the position of an object should be updated every 10 to 30 seconds [3].

Support for different queries: Assistance systems in the Smart Factory have to support different kinds of queries [3]. We can differentiate into object-based, location-based/spatial, temporal and combinations of the previous types of queries.

Integration of heterogeneous information: The integration challenge of different systems in an enterprise is caused by different information models, interfaces and data formats. In order to provide other systems easy accessible information, different systems have to be integrated into a common synchronizing platform.

Real-time characterized reaction: For supporting people and machines information has to be provided within seconds. This challenge addresses mainly communications technologies and database management.

The above-mentioned authors provided a guidance architecture for smart factory. In summary, the smart factory, which is based on digital and automated factory, uses information technology (e.g., cloud platform and IIoT) to improve the management of manufacturing resources and QoS [13], [14]. In order to build the smart factory, manufacturing enterprises should improve production and marketing, enhance controllability of production process, and reduce manual intervention in workshop. Through the analysis of manufacturing data, the smart factory can realize ﬂexible manufacturing, dynamic reconﬁguration, and production optimization, which are aimed to adapt the system to the changes of business model and consumer shopping behavior [15].

2『感觉 [13-15] 这篇 Paper 很重要。「2021025Context-Aware Cloud Robotics for Material Handling in Cognitive Industrial Internet of Things」目前没下载到原文，已下载「2021026Cloud Robotics: Current Status and Open Issues」、「2021006基于大数据的智慧工厂技术框架」并存入 Zotero。（2021-01-29）』

In the implementation of smart factory, the IIoT is employed to integrate the underlying equipment resources. Accordingly, the manufacturing system has abilities of perception, interconnection and data integration. The data analysis and scientiﬁc decision are used to achieve production scheduling, equipment service and quality control of products in smart factory. Further, the Internet of services is introduced to virtualize the manufacturing resources from a local database to the cloud server. Through the human-machine interaction, the global collaborative process of intelligent manufacturing oriented to the order-driven market is built. Therefore, the smart factory represents an engineering system that mainly consists of three aspects: interconnection, collaboration and execution. 

As shown in Fig. 1, the architecture of smart factory [16], [17] includes four layers, namely physical resource layer, network layer, data application layer, and terminal layer. With the aim to convert modern factory into smart factory, key technologies involved in all layers have to be studied in detail.

From the view of intelligent manufacturing, manufacturing equipment should be equipped with the abilities of edge computing, environment perception, and coordination between equipment. The smart factory, which is a cyber-physical production system (CPPS), integrates intelligent sensors, embedded terminal systems, intelligent control system, and communications facilities. The peer to peer interaction (e.g., person to equipment, equipment to equipment, service to service) is achieved by CPPS. Therefore, building of smart factory should take into consideration manufacturing characteristics to meet rapidly-changing market needs [95], [96]. In the following, we use the laboratory prototype platform as an example to explore typical characteristics of smart factory. The laboratory prototype platform, which represents a candy packing production line, is shown in Fig. 8.

FIGURE 8. Prototype platform for the validation of key technologies.

According to the smart factory architecture, the prototype platform had four layers including the physical resources layer, the cloud service layer, the terminal layer, and the network layer. The prototype layers were as follows.

1 The physical resources layer was consisted of intelligent equipment, conveyor equipment, packing products. It was mainly responsible for execution of tasks such as processing, monitoring, and assembling. The manufacturing process information was the primary data source for upper application.

2 The cloud service layer contained the cloud platform (a service cluster system based on the Hadoop architecture) which provided data storage and computing resource for data application. The ontology model of packing line was built on the cloud platform, and a relationship between objects was established in two dimensions: structure and interaction. The Protégé was used to build application-oriented ontology, and complex constraints were expressed by semantic web rule language. The manufacturing data were uploaded to the cloud platform to form a semantic data model. Based on the knowledge base, the Jena tool was used to reason the equipment operating mode. This layer provides supports for the fault alarm, the resource allocation, and the scheduling optimization.

3 The terminal layer mainly included end-user devices, such as smart phones, desktop computers and electrical boards, which were distributed in workshop, ofﬁce, monitoring center and other regions. Terminal devices were used to visualize the results of cloud processing, and they supported remote monitoring of operation and maintenance. Moreover, customers were able to check the order in real time using the intelligent terminal.

4 The network layer was used to connect layers within smart factory. According to the distributed control, the connection between controller and actuator was implemented by ﬁeld bus, Modbus, and EtherCAT. The connection between equipment was achieved by the combination of Ethernet and DDS, which formed the self-organized network. The connection between equipment and cloud platform was implemented by integration of Ethernet and OPC UA, which provided data interaction.

The basic ﬂow of candy packing is as follows. Firstly, customers choose candy and purchase it online. Then, the order information is sent directly to the manufacturing system. Finally, the completed order is automatically transported by logistical system of smart factory. The candy packaging line has typical characteristics of smart factory, such as high interconnection, dynamical reconﬁguration, deep integration, and so on.

In the experiment, we took into account factors such as equipment availability, equipment performance, and qualiﬁed rate of products. Next, we developed a cloud-aided manufacturing system, which gave suggestions on scheduling optimization of self-organized equipment. The six-month experiment was performed on the equipment of candy packaging line. The smart meter is used to measure the total electrical energy for the equipment in the lab. We calculated the related parameter every day, and the average was took as the value of the month. As shown in Fig. 9, the Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) of tested equipment is improved from 0.42 to 0.82 using the cloud-aided manufacturing system. Compared to the centralized scheduling, the self-organized scheduling with the cloud-aided manufacturing system has more remarkable effect. In general, the candy packing line is an example which was used to explore ﬂexibility, efﬁciency, and transparency of smart factory.

Object-oriented programming is primarily a data abstraction technique, and much of its power derives from this. However, it elaborates this technique with the notion of 'inheritance'. Inheritance can be used in a number of ways, some of which enhance the power of data abstraction. In these cases inheritance provides a useful addition to data abstraction.

This paper discusses the relationship between data abstraction and object-oriented programming. We begin in Section 2 by defining data abstraction and its role in the program development process. Then in Section 3 we discuss inheritance and identify two ways that it is used, for implementation hierarchy and for type hierarchy. Of the two methods, type hierarchy really adds something to data abstraction, so in Section 4 we discuss uses of type hierarchy in program design and development,. Next we discuss some issues that arise in implementing type hierarchy. We conclude with a summary of our results.

### 0107. 主题卡 ——「类」是为了实现「数据抽象」的

信息摘自「2021039Data-Abstraction-and-Hierarchy.md」

In Smalltalk [4], data abstractions are implemented by classes. Classes can be arranged hierarchical but we ignore this for now. A class implements a data abstraction similarly to a cluster. Instead of the "rep =" line, the rep is described by a sequence of variable declarations; these are the instance variables. The remainder of the class consists of methods, which are procedure definitions. There is a method for each operation of the data type implemented by the class. (There cannot be any internal methods in Smalltalk classes because it is not possible to preclude outside use of a method.) Methods are called by "sending messages," which has the same effect as calling operations in CLU.

[1] We ignore the class variables here since they are not important for the distinctions we are trying to make. CLU has an analogous mechanism; a cluster can have some own variables. [9]

### 0108. 主题卡 —— 继承的 2 种使用方式

信息摘自「2021039Data-Abstraction-and-Hierarchy.md」

Abstraction, and especially data abstraction, is an important technique for developing programs that are reasonably easy to maintain and to modify as requirements change. Data abstractions are particularly important because they hide complicated things (data structures) that are likely to change in the future. They permit the representation of data to be changed locally without affecting programs that use the data.

Inheritance is an implementation mechanism that allows one type to be related to another hierarchically. It is used in two ways: to implement a type by derivation from the implementation of another type, and to define subtypes. We argued that the first use is uninteresting because we can achieve the same result by using one type as the rep of the other. Subtypes, on the other hand, do add a new ability. Three uses for subtypes were identified. During incremental design they provide a way to limit the impact of design changes and to organize the design documentation. They also provide a way to group related types, especially in the case where the supertype is invented before any subtypes. When the relationship is discovered after several types have already been defined, other methods, such as grouping or procedure arguments, are probably better than hierarchy. Finally, hierarchy is a convenient and sensible way of organizing a library of types. The hierarchy is either a subtype hierarchy, or almost one the subtypes may not match our strict definition, but are similar to the supertype in some intuitive sense.

2『继承的 2 种使用方式，这几段的信息非常重要，但目前理解不了，待以后知识储量上去了再消化。先做一张主题卡片。（2021-09-09）』—— 未完成

Inheritance can be used to implement a subtype hierarchy. It is needed primarily in the case of related types when the supertype is invented first, because here it is convenient to implement common features just once in the superclass, and then implement the extensions separately for each subtype.

We conclude that although data abstraction is more important, type hierarchy does extend its usefulness. Furthermore, inheritance is sometimes needed to express type hierarchy and is therefore a useful mechanism to provide in a programming language.

An important goal in design is to identify a program structure that simplifies both program maintenance and program modifications made to support changing requirements. Data abstractions are a good way of achieving this goal. They allow us to abstract from the way data structures are implemented to the behavior they provide that other programs can rely on. They permit the representation of data to be changed locally without affecting programs that use the data. They are particularly important because they hide complicated things (data structures) that are likely to change in the future. They also simplify the structure of programs that use them because they present a higher level interface. For example, they reduce the number of arguments to procedures because abstract objects are communicated instead of their representations.

Object-oriented programming is primarily a data abstraction technique, and much of its power derives from this. However, it elaborates this technique with the notion of 'inheritance'. Inheritance can be used in a number of ways, some of which enhance the power of data abstraction. In these cases inheritance provides a useful addition to data abstraction.

Therefore, the industry needs a radical change and it is the Industrie 4.0 that addresses this change. The core idea of Industrie 4.0 is to use the emerging information technologies to implement IoT and services so that business process and engineering process are deeply integrated making production operate in a flexible, efficient, and green way with constantly high quality and low cost.

Some emerging information technologies, such as IoT, big data, and cloud computing as well as artificial intelligence (AI) technologies (e.g., MAS) are enabling factors of Industrie 4.0. Integrating these technologies with industrial automation, business, and trade is able to achieve a huge improvement of industry. With powerful microprocessors and AI technologies, the products and machines become smart in the sense that they not only have abilities of computing, communication, and control (3C) but also have autonomy and sociality. With the support of industrial networks, these smart artifacts are interconnected with each other and with the Internet. With the cloud computing technology, the server network can be virtualized as a resource pool that can provide scalable computing ability and storage space on demand for big data analytics. With numerous information systems deployed on cloud and smart things connected to the same cloud, a novel world of IoT and services is created.

### 0203. 术语卡 —— Lean Production

The production plants also become ever more complex despite all efforts at improving this situation. This in turn, results in longer planning phases and unacceptably long times-to-market. At this point, let's look back to 20 years ago. In the 1980s, we witnessed the first wave of integration of IT technologies into the factories computer integrated manufacturing (CIM), as it was called then The hope was that fully automated plants would solve cost and quality problems on the basis of state-of-the-art computer technology. Since humans would no longer fit in there, the visions of the future then aimed at deserted factories with no human workers. The reality arrived quite differently than imagined. These CIM systems were extremely complex in planning as well as in construction, operation, and maintenance. The technologies were not yet mature and the humans were overstrained. At the beginning of the 90's, when the crisis was obvious, a milestone was represented by the popular book by Womack, Jones and Roos: The Machine That Changed the World: The Story of Lean Production  (Womack, Jones, Roos, 1991), Which explained to the high-tech addicts in the western industry, how Toyota was able to build high quality automobiles with very simple production principles. These principles were known from then on as lean production, which became the paradigm of the beginning decade.

Lean production meant networks, not hierarchies; dynamic, self-coordinating work teams instead of monotonous assembly line jobs; and, most importantly, the personal responsibility of the individual worker. But this philosophy is directed primarily on the organization and less on the technologies.

The downscaling of computer and sensor technologies supports the integration of knowledge at all scales of a holistic production system, aiming at increasing the transformability of the factory as a whole. The presented Smart Factory approach represents a real-time, context sensitive manufacturing environment that can handle turbulences in production using decentralized information and communication structures for an optimum management of Production processes. Based on the Nexus Platform it integrates heterogeneous information systems in manufacturing enterprise both horizontal (e. G. Between systems in the shop floor) and vertical (e. G. Between shop floor and management systems like ERP or MES) in order to reduce information deficits. In the framework of the research area Smart Factory at the Universitat Stuttgart, IFF, a Smart Factory environment has been developed and will be enhanced, aiming at implementing the vision of the next-generation real-time and context-aware production systems.
