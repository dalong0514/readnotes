I’ll also talk about the attitudes and research styles that will make you more productive and accurate. For instance, a common misconception is that you can search and learn about anything, starting with nothing. The reality is that many research quests are foiled by not knowing enough about how to search. There’s a bit of a skill here that we’ll talk about. I’ll talk about how to start learning something in an area about which you know almost nothing. Unsurprisingly, to learn something, you have to begin with something. But how do you do that when your knowledge is at zero? Chance favors the prepared mind. Why is that true? And how can you prepare your mind?

There are skills and attitudes to learn from this book. My goal is to teach both: the skills to let you be an effective researcher, and a person with research-y attitudes. Both are important. Mostly, I HOPE to make you curious about the world and help you learn some of the skills it takes to successfully do online searches to get to good, high-quality, believable answers.

## 0101. Introduction: How You Can Harness the Power of Online Research—Why You Should Improve Your Online Researching Skills

This book has a simple idea: you too can be a great online researcher. It’s not hard, and it’s not computer geeky, but it’s an incredibly useful skill to have. If you can do better online research, you can ask and answer questions better—you can be more accurate, and you find out the information you need faster and more completely.

I’m a professional researcher who works at Google on the team that built the search engine. A big part of my job is to understand how people are using Google, in both good ways and less good ways. How do they use it successfully? And how is it that things occasionally don’t work the way you’d expect? For instance, sometimes I’ll see searchers spending thirty minutes searching for something that should take less than two minutes. Naturally, sometimes they find a less than great result. What makes someone a great online searcher? This book makes the case that learning how to be a better online researcher isn’t just a good idea; it’s something that we all need to know how to do.

Consider this: we all know about the three R’s of education: reading, writing, and ’rithmetic—the three basic skills that schools have to teach (which obviously doesn’t include spelling). This book makes the case that there’s a fourth R that we should be teaching to all students and adults: that is, research.

1『第四个 R，调研的能力。（2020-10-29）』

I don’t mean that you’ll have to spend your time doing learned investigations into strange and inscrutable depths of obscure history, or weird and exotic scientific studies. What I DO mean is that everyone can learn to use online information much more effectively and efficiently, whether you’re a student, citizen, parent, or professional researcher; there are things you should know about online research.

If you think about it, learning has changed from a school-only activity to a lifelong activity. And just as the person who can learn the best and know the most has a real advantage, so too does being a great online researcher give you a real advantage—in school, your work, and life. People fluent in search not only save time but are also far more likely to find higher-quality, more credible, more useful content. More important, they can ask questions that were impossible just a few years ago.

As Samuel Johnson wrote, Knowledge is of two kinds. We know a subject ourselves, or we know where we can find information upon it. 1

While that’s true, the common version of his quote usually leaves off the rest of his paragraph: When we enquire into any subject, the first thing we have to do is to know what books have treated of it. This leads us to look at catalogues, and at the backs of books in libraries. 2

2『两类知识，做一张术语卡片。』——已完成

In Johnson’s day that meant knowing how to do research AND knowing that catalogs existed, that libraries were collections of books on topics of interest, and that the back of a book contains an index. It also meant that you knew how to get into a library, many of which were still private and by subscription (that is, by「invitation」) only.

Most of the searches that Google sees in a typical day are fairly straightforward. The goal is clear, and the results are pretty obvious and unambiguous.

But a significant number of searches are not. Searchers might have a goal in mind, but they can’t figure out how to express it in a way that will give them what they want. Sometimes their query is precise, but they don’t know how to read and interpret the results. It drives me to distraction as a researcher because I know that the searcher is missing just one small but critical piece of information. We try to build as much as we can into the search algorithm, but people still need to know a bit about what the web is, and how search engines crawl, index, and respond to their queries. (Unlike in Johnson’s day, there’s no index in the back of the book of the internet.)

In a sense, that’s my mission: to help people become better researchers, beyond just the basic skill of knowing how to make Google dance to their tune. My goal is to help people understand the larger issues at play here: what it means to be a literate person now, and how to continuously learn to be literate as changes happen in the future.

Research is a skill that we all take for granted—we all use Google, and so we assume we’re good at it. Yet online research is a critical skill for our future. As the nature of work and education changes (and that, really, is the only constant we have), we need to bring our students (and ourselves) up to speed on what it takes to be good searchers. As teachers, parents, and citizens, we need to give them the skills of the fourth R—research—and all the skills and knowledge they need to function effectively as learned searchers.

What’s more, we’re trying to equip them with skills they can use not just now but also for every information search problem that we confront now and in the future.

So what kinds of things do you need to know?

To start with, there’s so much information available online that you might be forgiven for thinking it’s all online somewhere. And it is truly amazing what is available with a quick Google search. We live in a time of fantastic information richness and depth. But it wasn’t always like this. And what’s more, you need to know where the limits are, and how to detect when you’ve hit them.

One of the great discoveries of my young life was when I learned that there are books with answers in them that could satisfy my curiosity and let me do research almost instantaneously. Since I was a curious child, I found that by just picking up a volume of an encyclopedia. 3 I could read about many wonderful things—Eritrea, Eisenhower, eggs (development of), Earth (planet), ecru (the color) … on and on. All these riches—and just in the volume of the letter「E.」What mysteries lay in「F」or「G」? Why was there a volume「X, Y, and Z,」and not「M, N, and O」?

That was then, this is now, and it’s difficult to find any reference content that’s organized alphabetically. Why would you, when it’s so much faster to do a search for what you seek? Today we have vast resources online, indexed by search engines, or sometimes organized into websites and databases—all there for the questing mind to use.

All that information is out there, so it’s frustrating to see books and articles that assert some piece of information is true, but don’t tell you the source or how they know it’s true.

I find it deeply frustrating to be told something about the world and then have it be unsubstantiated. I’ve always wanted to know how I could figure this out on my own.

This is especially true for books of trivia and fascinating content. You know what I mean—those books and websites that collect the biggest, longest, heaviest, or most unbelievable facts about the world. They’re great, but I want to shout at them, HOW do you know that? WHERE did you find that morsel of information? (Or did you just make it up?) Even fact-checking websites and collections of interesting facts don’t tell you the story behind the information. If you’re lucky, they’ll point to something else. But it’s rare that they actually tell you how to figure it out for yourself. And that’s only if you’re lucky.

There are also a good number of books that tell you how to use online information resources. But there’s a gap in those texts: they tell you the various things you can do, but not how to hook them all together to go from an initial question to a satisfying answer. This book, however, is about HOW to answer those questions yourself. It is about HOW to frame your questions and use the various online research tools that let you get the answers yourself, from the beginning of your curious question, to finding results via many different online resources.

And that’s the point of this book: you too can ask, and answer, your curious questions.

Here I’ll show you how to find things out by showing you the steps (and occasional missteps) that I’ve gone through while doing my own research. Each chapter is a story—one that documents how I’ve found the answers to questions I’ve had (or have been asked). Along the way, I’ll tell you exactly how I did each search step, and why.

My work for the past thirteen years as a research scientist at Google has been to study how people use various kinds of online information sources to answer questions that they have. And it’s been puzzling. The online world has an immense set of resources at hand, and yet I see that most people don’t really understand how to use it effectively. It’s as though we’ve all been given a Steinway, but we only know「Chopsticks.」Or you just got a Formula 1 racing car, but nobody ever showed you how to take it out of first gear. We have these amazing tools that we just don’t know how to use well.

For most simple queries—those in first gear—search engines (such as Google) work extremely well. Search engines’ ability to quickly provide answers to these queries is a remarkable testament to their power and scope as well as the advances in information engineering during the past few decades. But there’s so much more these engines can do.

Clearly, search engines are different from traditional information sources; they’re not at all like the encyclopedias of my youth. Need to know the population of Japan? The number of elementary schools in the United States? The signers of the Declaration of Independence and where they lived at the time? How about the distance from the Earth to the Sun? Ask, and you’ll get the answer in the twinkle of an eye. With the rise of easily accessible online searches, anyone can answer these questions quickly, accurately, and at any time of day from their laptop, desktop, or phone. What’s more, unlike the encyclopedias of yore, these information sources are up to date.

And yet if you know just a little more about searching, if you realize the depth of information processing available to you, if you learn a touch of sleuthing and take advantage of your new ability to shift ordinary memory tasks to the machine, search engines can become more of an intelligence amplifier for you than just a simple collection of data. That power is not only truly fun to have, but also gives you the ability to understand how things work and see more deeply in the world.

Through online search tools, the world is your information oyster, at your disposal twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. Those who are fluent in search and retrieval not only save time but also are far more likely to find higher-quality, more credible, more useful content. They can ask questions that were impossible just a few years ago. They can think faster and find solutions more easily. They can quickly get to the bottom of that wild news story they read and the top of their career ladders too. Whether they’re students, professionals, or stay-at-home parents, those who are good at doing online research have a real advantage over those who aren’t.

Even though「research」is often thought to be what professional scientists do, the truth is that it’s something we all do every day. My mission—the mission of this book—is to help you become better at it, go beyond the basic skill of typing something into Google and learn how to ask a search engine a good question, and understand what it means to be a literate person today and in the future. My goal is to show you the marvelous depth of knowledge at your fingertips, and my hope is to share with you the great joy of finding out.

I’ll also talk about the attitudes and research styles that will make you more productive and accurate. For instance, a common misconception is that you can search and learn about anything, starting with nothing. The reality is that many research quests are foiled by not knowing enough about how to search. There’s a bit of a skill here that we’ll talk about. I’ll talk about how to start learning something in an area about which you know almost nothing. Unsurprisingly, to learn something, you have to begin with something. But how do you do that when your knowledge is at zero? Chance favors the prepared mind. Why is that true? And how can you prepare your mind?

There are skills and attitudes to learn from this book. My goal is to teach both: the skills to let you be an effective researcher, and a person with research-y attitudes. Both are important. Mostly, I HOPE to make you curious about the world and help you learn some of the skills it takes to successfully do online searches to get to good, high-quality, believable answers.

### 1.1 How to Read This Book

This book is composed of sixteen stories about how I answered some questions that came up for me during the course of my life. These chapters walk you through my stories of discovery, laying out the journey I went through to find out the answers to some particularly interesting questions. Along the way, I’ll show you just how I solved them, and how you can do the same kind of thing.

The first half (chapters 2–9) are primarily about tactics—that is, the individual steps you need to know to work with online resources. In these chapters, I’ll use a variety of different resources along with some of the tips and tricks that make searching these easier.

In the second half (chapter 10–18), I’ll talk more about the strategies I used to guide my search process. When should you keep searching? When should you stop? How do you decide when a particular research path is leading you to a dry hole?

In each chapter, I’ll start our investigations with a research question, using this as a way to be careful about what we’re searching for. You’ll see each research question separated out in the text. For example,「Where was this photograph taken?」Or the research question might be some curiosity about some observation in the world—such as「Why do lakes sometimes explode?」—that seems utterly bizarre, and when you follow your curiosity, you’ll find out where, why, or how this thing can be answered.

Even though it’s a simple thing, just writing down the question has the side benefit of helping to frame what you’re about to do. I know, it sounds too simple to actually work, but it’s true. If you take ten seconds to write down your question BEFORE you start your research process, you’ll find your process will be much, much more effective. It’s almost magical; you have to figure out (a) what you’re really asking, (b) what terms you’ll be searching for, and (c) what kind of answer will satisfy you.

That’s what I do in each chapter: I write down the questions, and then walk through the steps I took to find the answer. Instead of just telling you the answer, I’m trying to make it clear exactly how I went from really interesting question to an answer that I believe.

As you read these stories, I’ll point out how I use each of the tools and information resources along the way. Every so often you’ll see some text in square brackets like this: `[exploding lakes in Africa]`. That’s a query. The text in the brackets is what I searched for in order to answer a particular question. But note that you shouldn’t include the brackets in your search; they’re just there to show you where the actual query starts and ends. Every chapter has the online searches I used along the way.

At the end of each chapter is a set of research lessons that summarize the things you should have picked up during the story. These are the insights that you can use in answering your own questions.

I’ve also added a bunch of「How to Do It」notes at the end of each chapter. When you see bolded text that has a superscript letter—such as this example of how to make a good query for searching[A]—you’ll find a short note at the end of the chapter telling you how to do this particular step of the research process. (And of course, if that’s not enough information for you, you could always do another search to get even more details!)

As you read you’ll also see URLs that look like this: bit.LY/TJOS-1-1. These are links to online web pages that are easier to type than a full URL, which are often long and full of strange characters that nobody can transcribe correctly. But the bit.LY links are short and easy to type. This is a nice solution to the perennial problem of「How do you put links to online resources in a print document?」Note that these links are case sensitive. TJOS-1–1 is not the same as tjos-1–1! Be sure to use all capital letters.

Note also that you should not include any trailing periods. In the typesetting process, a period is added to the end of a sentence to indicate the end. But if that sentence (or citation) ends with a URL, be careful not to add the trailing period to the URL you type! You want to type bit.LY/TJOS-1-1 without any extra period (i.e., do not type bit.LY/TJOS-1-1.).

The last two chapters summarize what this book has to teach. It’s really true that in this case, the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. Chapter 19 offers many of the lessons I’ve learned all pulled together into a tidy summary that’s worth reading because it reflects on ALL the chapters. Sometimes you can see things more clearly when you see many of the lessons side by side. Chapter 20 gives you an idea about the future of online research.

Now let’s go find out something amazing about the world.

I’ll start the next chapter with a photograph that a friend sent to me, asking where on earth he took it. Remarkably, I was able to figure it out fairly quickly just by doing a few online searches. Let’s see how. Once you see how it’s done, you’ll be able to do this too.

Onward. Let’s do some research.

### 1.2 How to Do It

A. How to make an effective query.

One of the great pieces of search engine technology is that queries can be simple, just a few words long, and you’ll often find the information you’re seeking. Knowing a couple of things about how search engines work, however, will make your searching far better.

You should know that there are a few different approaches to doing a query on a search engine such as Google, Bing, Wolfram Alpha, or DuckDuckGo. The classic query style is to use a few words (sometimes called keywords) that describe the kind of web result you seek. A classic query is best made by choosing a few terms that are central to the idea you’re searching for, and ones that you think will be on the web page. Classic queries look like this:

```
[Japan population]

[most Olympic gold medals]
```

As search engines improve their question-handling ability, they are getting better at handling questions posed in a more natural fashion, such as a question-answering query style like this:

```
[What is the population of Japan?]

[Who has won the most Olympic gold medals?]
```

Generally speaking, the best queries are those that use on-topic words (for the classical queries) or consist of clearly stated questions. When a question-query is answerable, the results usually give much more context information on that topic. (For instance, `[What is the population of Japan?]` will give some contextualized data as well.)

While search engines let you use some special operators (that is, special terms that modify the meaning of your query), more than 99 percent of all queries don’t use anything special; they’re just classical queries or simple questions.

In particular, people rarely, if ever, use Boolean queries in their classical searches. 4 Both Google and Bing automatically put an implied AND between all the terms (although they might drop a term from the list if there aren’t any results with all the terms). On the other hand, sometimes using an OR in the query is a useful way to specify synonyms for a search term. For example, you can look for jobs in either (or both) of two cities with a query like this:

```
[Dallas OR Houston jobs software development]
```

This query means that the search engine will look for either Dallas or Houston on the web pages.

But if you don’t want anything from Houston, you can use the minus sign (−) before that term to exclude it from the search results. This query will show jobs in Dallas, but none from Houston.

```
[Dallas −Houston jobs software development]
```

Overall, the classical queries are best when they use terms that you’d expect to find on the ideal page that will answer your query. There’s much more to talk about, and that’s what the rest of the book will discuss.
