创始人模式

2024 年 9 月

At a YC event last week Brian Chesky gave a talk that everyone who was there will remember. Most founders I talked to afterward said it was the best they'd ever heard. Ron Conway, for the first time in his life, forgot to take notes. I'm not going to try to reproduce it here. Instead I want to talk about a question it raised.

上周在一个 Y Combinator（YC）创业加速器的活动中，Airbnb 联合创始人 Brian Chesky 做了一场令人难忘的演讲。之后我与多位创始人交流，他们纷纷表示这是他们听过的最精彩的演讲。就连著名天使投资人 Ron Conway 也破天荒地忘记了做笔记，这在他的投资生涯中还是头一回。

我并不打算在这里复述整个演讲内容。相反，我想探讨一下这次演讲引发的一个有趣问题。

The theme of Brian's talk was that the conventional wisdom about how to run larger companies is mistaken. As Airbnb grew, well-meaning people advised him that he had to run the company in a certain way for it to scale. Their advice could be optimistically summarized as "hire good people and give them room to do their jobs." He followed this advice and the results were disastrous. So he had to figure out a better way on his own, which he did partly by studying how Steve Jobs ran Apple. So far it seems to be working. Airbnb's free cash flow margin is now among the best in Silicon Valley.

Brian 演讲的核心观点是，人们对于如何管理大型公司的普遍看法其实是有误的。随着 Airbnb 的快速发展，一些好心人向他提出建议，认为要想让公司实现持续增长，就必须采用某种特定的管理方式。这些建议可以乐观地概括为「聘请优秀人才，给予他们充分发挥的空间」。Brian 起初采纳了这些建议，但结果却令人大失所望。

这个挫折促使 Brian 不得不独自摸索出一条更适合的管理之道。在这个过程中，他特别研究了 Steve Jobs 是如何管理 Apple 的。令人欣慰的是，他的新方法似乎正在显现成效。如今，Airbnb 的自由现金流利润率（衡量公司运营效率和盈利能力的重要指标）已跻身硅谷顶尖企业行列。

The audience at this event included a lot of the most successful founders we've funded, and one after another said that the same thing had happened to them. They'd been given the same advice about how to run their companies as they grew, but instead of helping their companies, it had damaged them.

在这次活动中，许多我们资助过的最成功创始人也在场。令人惊讶的是，他们纷纷表示经历了相同的情况。在公司成长过程中，这些创始人都收到了类似的经营建议。然而，这些建议非但没有促进公司发展，反而对公司造成了损害。

Why was everyone telling these founders the wrong thing? That was the big mystery to me. And after mulling it over for a bit I figured out the answer: what they were being told was how to run a company you hadn't founded — how to run a company if you're merely a professional manager. But this m.o. is so much less effective that to founders it feels broken. There are things founders can do that managers can't, and not doing them feels wrong to founders, because it is.

为什么所有人都在给这些创始人错误的建议？这个问题一直困扰着我。经过一番思索，我终于找到了答案：他们得到的建议其实是关于如何管理一家你并非创始人的公司 —— 换句话说，就是作为一个职业经理人该如何管理公司。但这种管理方式效果差强人意，以至于创始人们会觉得这种方法根本行不通。事实上，创始人能做到而普通经理做不到的事情确实存在。对创始人来说，不去做这些事感觉就是大错特错，因为事实确实如此。

In effect there are two different ways to run a company: founder mode and manager mode. Till now most people even in Silicon Valley have implicitly assumed that scaling a startup meant switching to manager mode. But we can infer the existence of another mode from the dismay of founders who've tried it, and the success of their attempts to escape from it.

实际上，经营公司有两种不同的方式：创始人思维和职业经理人思维。直到现在，就连硅谷的大多数人也普遍认为，初创公司要想扩大规模，就必须切换到职业经理人的思维模式。然而，从那些尝试过这种模式的创始人所表现出的失望，以及他们成功摆脱这种模式的尝试中，我们可以推测出另一种经营方式的存在。

There are as far as I know no books specifically about founder mode. Business schools don't know it exists. All we have so far are the experiments of individual founders who've been figuring it out for themselves. But now that we know what we're looking for, we can search for it. I hope in a few years founder mode will be as well understood as manager mode. We can already guess at some of the ways it will differ.

据我所知，目前还没有专门讨论创始人模式（founder mode）的书籍。商学院甚至还没有意识到这种模式的存在。到目前为止，我们所了解的仅仅来自于个别创始人自己摸索和实践的结果。不过，现在我们已经明确了研究的方向，就可以开始有目标地探索这个领域了。我希望在未来几年内，创始人模式能够像管理者模式（manager mode）一样被深入理解。我们现在已经可以预见，创始人模式在许多方面将与管理者模式有所不同。

The way managers are taught to run companies seems to be like modular design in the sense that you treat subtrees of the org chart as black boxes. You tell your direct reports what to do, and it's up to them to figure out how. But you don't get involved in the details of what they do. That would be micromanaging them, which is bad.

管理者被教导如何运营公司的方式，似乎与软件开发中的模块化设计有异曲同工之妙。在这种管理方法中，你会将组织架构中的各个部门或团队视为独立的「黑匣子」—— 就像模块化设计中的独立模块一样，你只需关注其输入和输出，而不必深入了解内部运作机制。

具体来说，你会告诉直属手下（比如各部门负责人）应该完成什么任务，但至于如何完成，则完全交由他们自行决定。作为管理者，你不应该过多干预他们工作的具体细节。这种过度干预被称为「微观管理」（micromanaging），通常被认为是一种不良的管理行为。

这种管理方式强调授权和信任，让下属在各自的领域里发挥专长，同时也使高层管理者能够专注于更宏观的战略决策。

Hire good people and give them room to do their jobs. Sounds great when it's described that way, doesn't it? Except in practice, judging from the report of founder after founder, what this often turns out to mean is: hire professional fakers and let them drive the company into the ground.

招聘优秀人才，给他们充分施展的空间。乍一听，这个理念是不是很吸引人？但是在现实中，根据众多创始人的亲身经历，这种做法往往演变成了：招来一群「专业戏精」，然后眼睁睁看着他们把公司带入深渊。

One theme I noticed both in Brian's talk and when talking to founders afterward was the idea of being gaslit. Founders feel like they're being gaslit from both sides — by the people telling them they have to run their companies like managers, and by the people working for them when they do. Usually when everyone around you disagrees with you, your default assumption should be that you're mistaken. But this is one of the rare exceptions. VCs who haven't been founders themselves don't know how founders should run companies, and C-level execs, as a class, include some of the most skillful liars in the world. [1]

在 Brian 的演讲中，以及后来与创始人的交谈中，我注意到一个共同的主题：创始人们感觉自己正受到双重的误导和压力。一方面，有人告诉他们必须像职业经理人那样管理公司；另一方面，当他们真的这样做时，又会受到员工的质疑。通常情况下，当周围的人都不赞同你时，你应该会认为是自己错了。但这种情况恰恰是少有的例外之一。那些从未亲身创业的风险投资人（VC）并不真正了解创始人应该如何经营公司。而那些高管们，尤其是 C 级高管（如 CEO、CFO 等公司最高层管理者），作为一个群体，其中不乏一些世界顶级的「话术高手」。[1]

Whatever founder mode consists of, it's pretty clear that it's going to break the principle that the CEO should engage with the company only via his or her direct reports. "Skip-level" meetings will become the norm instead of a practice so unusual that there's a name for it. And once you abandon that constraint there are a huge number of permutations to choose from.

无论「创始人模式」具体包含什么内容，有一点是显而易见的：它将打破首席执行官（CEO）应该只通过直接下属与公司互动的传统原则。所谓的「越级」会议（即高层领导直接与低层员工交流的会议）将从一种少见到需要专门命名的做法，变成一种常态。一旦突破了这个限制，就会出现大量的可能性供人选择。

For example, Steve Jobs used to run an annual retreat for what he considered the 100 most important people at Apple, and these were not the 100 people highest on the org chart. Can you imagine the force of will it would take to do this at the average company? And yet imagine how useful such a thing could be. It could make a big company feel like a startup. Steve presumably wouldn't have kept having these retreats if they didn't work. But I've never heard of another company doing this. So is it a good idea, or a bad one? We still don't know. That's how little we know about founder mode. [2]

举个例子，Steve Jobs 曾经每年都会组织一次闭门会议，参加者是他认为苹果公司最重要的 100 人，而这 100 人并非公司组织架构中最高层的人员。你能想象在普通公司推行这种做法需要多大的魄力吗？然而，仔细想想这样做可能带来的效果：它能让一家大公司保持创业公司的活力。Steve 之所以坚持举办这些会议，想必是因为它们确实卓有成效。但奇怪的是，我从未听说过其他公司效仿这种做法。那么，这到底是个好主意还是坏主意呢？我们至今仍无从得知。这正说明了我们对于「创始人模式」的认知还是如此有限。[2]

Obviously founders can't keep running a 2000 person company the way they ran it when it had 20. There's going to have to be some amount of delegation. Where the borders of autonomy end up, and how sharp they are, will probably vary from company to company. They'll even vary from time to time within the same company, as managers earn trust. So founder mode will be more complicated than manager mode. But it will also work better. We already know that from the examples of individual founders groping their way toward it.

显然，创始人无法用管理 20 人小公司的方式来运营一个 2000 人的大公司。这必然需要进行一定程度的权力下放。自主权的界限在哪里，以及这些界限有多清晰，可能会因公司而异。即使在同一家公司内，随着时间推移和管理者逐渐赢得信任，这些界限也会发生变化。因此，创始人模式（founder mode）将比管理者模式（manager mode）更为复杂。但与此同时，创始人模式也会运作得更加有效。这一点已经从一些创始人摸索前进的实际案例中得到了证实。

Indeed, another prediction I'll make about founder mode is that once we figure out what it is, we'll find that a number of individual founders were already most of the way there — except that in doing what they did they were regarded by many as eccentric or worse. [3]

事实上，关于创始人模式（founder mode）我还有另一个预测：一旦我们真正理解了它的本质，我们可能会发现许多个人创始人其实早已相当接近这种状态了。然而，有趣的是，这些创始人在实践过程中，却常常被很多人视为怪人，甚至遭受更为严厉的评判。[3]

Curiously enough it's an encouraging thought that we still know so little about founder mode. Look at what founders have achieved already, and yet they've achieved this against a headwind of bad advice. Imagine what they'll do once we can tell them how to run their companies like Steve Jobs instead of John Sculley.

令人深思的是，我们对创始人模式（founder mode）的了解还如此有限，这反而是一个令人鼓舞的事实。回顾创始人们已经取得的卓越成就，我们会发现他们是在面对大量不当建议的阻力下依然成功的。试想一下，如果我们能够指导他们像 Steve Jobs 那样管理公司，而不是采用 John Sculley 的方式，他们将会创造出怎样的奇迹。（注：Steve Jobs 是苹果公司的联合创始人，以创新和远见著称；John Sculley 曾是苹果公司 CEO，但其管理风格与 Jobs 大相径庭。）

### Notes

[1] The more diplomatic way of phrasing this statement would be to say that experienced C-level execs are often very skilled at managing up. And I don't think anyone with knowledge of this world would dispute that.

[2] If the practice of having such retreats became so widespread that even mature companies dominated by politics started to do it, we could quantify the senescence of companies by the average depth on the org chart of those invited.

[3] I also have another less optimistic prediction: as soon as the concept of founder mode becomes established, people will start misusing it. Founders who are unable to delegate even things they should will use founder mode as the excuse. Or managers who aren't founders will decide they should try to act like founders. That may even work, to some extent, but the results will be messy when it doesn't; the modular approach does at least limit the damage a bad CEO can do.
