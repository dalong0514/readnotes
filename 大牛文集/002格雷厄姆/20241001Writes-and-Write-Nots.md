October 2024

I'm usually reluctant to make predictions about technology, but I feel fairly confident about this one: in a couple decades there won't be many people who can write.

One of the strangest things you learn if you're a writer is how many people have trouble writing. Doctors know how many people have a mole they're worried about; people who are good at setting up computers know how many people aren't; writers know how many people need help writing.

The reason so many people have trouble writing is that it's fundamentally difficult. To write well you have to think clearly, and thinking clearly is hard.

And yet writing pervades many jobs, and the more prestigious the job, the more writing it tends to require.

These two powerful opposing forces, the pervasive expectation of writing and the irreducible difficulty of doing it, create enormous pressure. This is why eminent professors often turn out to have resorted to plagiarism. The most striking thing to me about these cases is the pettiness of the thefts. The stuff they steal is usually the most mundane boilerplate — the sort of thing that anyone who was even halfway decent at writing could turn out with no effort at all. Which means they're not even halfway decent at writing.

Till recently there was no convenient escape valve for the pressure created by these opposing forces. You could pay someone to write for you, like JFK, or plagiarize, like MLK, but if you couldn't buy or steal words, you had to write them yourself. And as a result nearly everyone who was expected to write had to learn how.

Not anymore. AI has blown this world open. Almost all pressure to write has dissipated. You can have AI do it for you, both in school and at work.

The result will be a world divided into writes and write-nots. There will still be some people who can write. Some of us like it. But the middle ground between those who are good at writing and those who can't write at all will disappear. Instead of good writers, ok writers, and people who can't write, there will just be good writers and people who can't write.

Is that so bad? Isn't it common for skills to disappear when technology makes them obsolete? There aren't many blacksmiths left, and it doesn't seem to be a problem.

Yes, it's bad. The reason is something I mentioned earlier: writing is thinking. In fact there's a kind of thinking that can only be done by writing. You can't make this point better than Leslie Lamport did:
If you're thinking without writing, you only think you're thinking.
So a world divided into writes and write-nots is more dangerous than it sounds. It will be a world of thinks and think-nots. I know which half I want to be in, and I bet you do too.

This situation is not unprecedented. In preindustrial times most people's jobs made them strong. Now if you want to be strong, you work out. So there are still strong people, but only those who choose to be.

It will be the same with writing. There will still be smart people, but only those who choose to be.

写者与不写者

2024 年 10 月

我通常不愿对技术做出预测，但我对这一点相当有信心：再过几十年，能写作的人将寥寥无几。

如果你是一名作家，你会学到一个非常奇怪的事实：有很多人写作有困难。就像医生知道有多少人担心自己身上的痣，擅长设置电脑的人知道有多少人不会设置电脑一样，作家知道有多少人需要写作上的帮助。

很多人写作困难的原因是，写作本质上很难。要写得好，你必须要思路清晰，而清晰地思考是件难事。

然而，写作渗透到了许多工作中，职位越是体面，往往需要写作的要求就越多。

这两种强大的对立力量 —— 无处不在的写作要求和写作本身不可简化的难度 —— 产生了巨大的压力。这就是为什么一些著名教授最终被发现抄袭的原因。让我感到最震惊的是这些抄袭行为的琐碎性。他们偷的内容通常是最普通的陈词滥调 —— 任何一个写作水平稍微过得去的人都可以毫不费力地写出来的东西。这意味着他们的写作水平甚至连「稍微过得去」都达不到。

直到最近，这种由对立力量产生的压力还没有方便的出口。你可以像肯尼迪那样花钱请人写，或者像马丁·路德·金那样抄袭，但如果你既买不到文字又偷不来，你就得自己写。因此，几乎所有需要写作的人都不得不学会如何写。

但现在不一样了。AI 打破了这个局面。几乎所有写作的压力都消散了。无论是在学校还是在工作中，你都可以让 AI 替你写作。

结果将是一个分裂成「写者」和「不写者」的世界。仍然会有一些人会写作，因为我们中的一些人喜欢写作。但介于会写作的人和完全不会写作的人之间的中间地带将消失。届时，不再会有好作家、普通作家和不会写作的人，只有好作家和不会写作的人。

这真的那么糟糕吗？当技术让某些技能变得过时时，这些技能消失并不常见吗？如今铁匠已经不多了，这似乎并不是什么问题。

是的，这很糟糕。原因是我前面提到的一点：写作就是思考。实际上，有一种思考方式只能通过写作来完成。你无法比莱斯利·兰伯特的这句话更好地表达这个观点：

**如果你在不写作的情况下思考，你只是以为自己在思考。**

因此，一个分裂为「写者」和「不写者」的世界比听起来更危险。这将是一个「思考者」和「不思考者」的世界。我知道我想要在哪一边，我敢打赌你也知道。

这种情况并非前所未有。在工业化之前，大多数人的工作使他们变得强壮。现在，如果你想变得强壮，你得去健身。所以仍然有强壮的人，但只有那些选择变强壮的人。

写作也将如此。仍然会有聪明的人，但只有那些选择变聪明的人。
