When To Do What You Love

September 2024

There's some debate about whether it's a good idea to "follow your passion." In fact the question is impossible to answer with a simple yes or no. Sometimes you should and sometimes you shouldn't, but the border between should and shouldn't is very complicated. The only way to give a general answer is to trace it.

When people talk about this question, there's always an implicit "instead of." All other things being equal, why wouldn't you work on what interests you the most? So even raising the question implies that all other things aren't equal, and that you have to choose between working on what interests you the most and something else, like what pays the best.

And indeed if your main goal is to make money, you can't usually afford to work on what interests you the most. People pay you for doing what they want, not what you want. But there's an obvious exception: when you both want the same thing. For example, if you love football, and you're good enough at it, you can get paid a lot to play it.

Of course the odds are against you in a case like football, because so many other people like playing it too. This is not to say you shouldn't try though. It depends how much ability you have and how hard you're willing to work.

The odds are better when you have strange tastes: when you like something that pays well and that few other people like. For example, it's clear that Bill Gates truly loved running a software company. He didn't just love programming, which a lot of people do. He loved writing software for customers. That is a very strange taste indeed, but if you have it, you can make a lot by indulging it.

There are even some people who have a genuine intellectual interest in making money. This is distinct from mere greed. They just can't help noticing when something is mispriced, and can't help doing something about it. It's like a puzzle for them. [1]

In fact there's an edge case here so spectacular that it turns all the preceding advice on its head. If you want to make a really huge amount of money — hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars — it turns out to be very useful to work on what interests you the most. The reason is not the extra motivation you get from doing this, but that the way to make a really large amount of money is to start a startup, and working on what interests you is an excellent way to discover startup ideas.

Many if not most of the biggest startups began as projects the founders were doing for fun. Apple, Google, and Facebook all began that way. Why is this pattern so common? Because the best ideas tend to be such outliers that you'd overlook them if you were consciously looking for ways to make money. Whereas if you're young and good at technology, your unconscious instincts about what would be interesting to work on are very well aligned with what needs to be built.

So there's something like a midwit peak for making money. If you don't need to make much, you can work on whatever you're most interested in; if you want to become moderately rich, you can't usually afford to; but if you want to become super rich, and you're young and good at technology, working on what you're most interested in becomes a good idea again.

What if you're not sure what you want? What if you're attracted to the idea of making money and more attracted to some kinds of work than others, but neither attraction predominates? How do you break ties?

The key here is to understand that such ties are only apparent. When you have trouble choosing between following your interests and making money, it's never because you have complete knowledge of yourself and of the types of work you're choosing between, and the options are perfectly balanced. When you can't decide which path to take, it's almost always due to ignorance. In fact you're usually suffering from three kinds of ignorance simultaneously: you don't know what makes you happy, what the various kinds of work are really like, or how well you could do them. [2]

In a way this ignorance is excusable. It's often hard to predict these things, and no one even tells you that you need to. If you're ambitious you're told you should go to college, and this is good advice so far as it goes, but that's where it usually ends. No one tells you how to figure out what to work on, or how hard this can be.

What do you do in the face of uncertainty? Get more certainty. And probably the best way to do that is to try working on things you're interested in. That will get you more information about how interested you are in them, how good you are at them, and how much scope they offer for ambition.

Don't wait. Don't wait till the end of college to figure out what to work on. Don't even wait for internships during college. You don't necessarily need a job doing x in order to work on x; often you can just start doing it in some form yourself. And since figuring out what to work on is a problem that could take years to solve, the sooner you start, the better.

One useful trick for judging different kinds of work is to look at who your colleagues will be. You'll become like whoever you work with. Do you want to become like these people?

Indeed, the difference in character between different kinds of work is magnified by the fact that everyone else is facing the same decisions as you. If you choose a kind of work mainly for how well it pays, you'll be surrounded by other people who chose it for the same reason, and that will make it even more soul-sucking than it seems from the outside. Whereas if you choose work you're genuinely interested in, you'll be surrounded mostly by other people who are genuinely interested in it, and that will make it extra inspiring. [3]

The other thing you do in the face of uncertainty is to make choices that are uncertainty-proof. The less sure you are about what to do, the more important it is to choose options that give you more options in the future. I call this "staying upwind." If you're unsure whether to major in math or economics, for example, choose math; math is upwind of economics in the sense that it will be easier to switch later from math to economics than from economics to math.

There's one case, though, where it's easy to say whether you should work on what interests you the most: if you want to do great work. This is not a sufficient condition for doing great work, but it is a necessary one.

There's a lot of selection bias in advice about whether to "follow your passion," and this is the reason. Most such advice comes from people who are famously successful, and if you ask someone who's famously successful how to do what they did, most will tell you that you have to work on what you're most interested in. And this is in fact true.

That doesn't mean it's the right advice for everyone. Not everyone can do great work, or wants to. But if you do want to, the complicated question of whether or not to work on what interests you the most becomes simple. The answer is yes. The root of great work is a sort of ambitious curiosity, and you can't manufacture that.

何时做你热爱的事

关于是否应该「追随内心的热情」，一直存在争议。实际上，这个问题无法简单地用是或否来回答。有时候应该这样做，有时候则不应该，但其中的界限相当模糊。要给出一个普遍性的答案，我们需要深入分析这个问题。

当人们讨论这个话题时，总是暗含着一个「而不是做其他事」的选项。如果其他条件都相同，谁不愿意做自己最感兴趣的事呢？所以，当这个问题被提出时，就意味着现实中其他条件并不相同，你必须在最感兴趣的事情和其他选择之间做出取舍，比如选择最赚钱的工作。

的确，如果你的主要目标是赚钱，你往往就没法专注于自己最感兴趣的事情。毕竟人们支付报酬，是让你完成他们需要的工作，而不是你想做的事。不过这里有一个明显的例外：当你的兴趣恰好符合他人的需求时。比如说，如果你热爱足球，而且确实有这个实力，你完全可以靠踢球赚到丰厚的收入。

在足球这样的领域，你的成功机会确实不大，毕竟热爱足球的人实在太多了。但这并不意味着你就不该去尝试，关键还是要看你自身的天赋有多少，以及你愿意投入多少努力。

当你拥有与众不同的兴趣爱好时，成功的机会反而更大：特别是当你喜欢上那些收入可观、却很少有人感兴趣的事物时。比如说，Bill Gates 显然特别热爱经营软件公司。他不只是热爱编程 —— 这一点很多人都做得到，但他更热衷于为客户开发软件。这确实是个相当独特的爱好，但正是这种独特的兴趣为他带来了丰厚的回报。

有趣的是，还有一些人对赚钱本身就抱有纯粹的智力兴趣。这与简单的贪婪完全不同。他们天生就对价格失衡特别敏感，而且总忍不住想要从中寻找机会。对他们来说，这就像是在解决一个有趣的谜题。[1]

实际上，这里有一个极其特殊的例外，它完全推翻了我们之前所说的一切。如果你想赚到真正巨额的财富 —— 几亿甚至上百亿美元 —— 专注于你最感兴趣的事情反而会很有帮助。这并不是因为兴趣能给你带来额外的动力，而是因为要赚取巨额财富，创办初创公司是最佳途径，而深入研究自己感兴趣的领域恰恰是发现创业机会的最好方式。

很多大型初创公司，可能甚至是大多数，最初都只是创始人们的兴趣项目。Apple、Google 和 Facebook 的诞生都是如此。为什么这种现象如此普遍？因为最优秀的创意往往都极其独特，如果你刻意去寻找赚钱的方法，反而会忽略它们。相比之下，如果你年轻且精通技术，你对有趣工作的直觉往往恰好能够指向那些真正需要被创造的事物。

在赚钱这件事上存在一个有趣的现象，就像一条倒 U 形曲线。如果你对收入要求不高，可以自由地追随兴趣；如果你想要达到中等财富水平，往往就不得不放弃兴趣取向；但如果你想要获得极高的财富，而且你年轻又精通技术，那么追随兴趣反而再次成为明智之选。

假如你还没有明确的方向怎么办？如果你既被赚钱的前景所吸引，又对某些工作领域特别感兴趣，但这两种倾向都不是特别强烈，该如何抉择？

关键在于要明白，这种看似两难的选择其实并非真正的平衡。当你在追随兴趣和追求财富之间犹豫不决时，绝不是因为你对自己和各种工作选项都了如指掌，更不是因为这些选项真的势均力敌。实际上，当你难以做出选择时，几乎都是源于认知的局限。具体来说，你通常会同时面临三个认知盲区：不了解什么能真正让自己快乐，不清楚各种工作的真实面貌，也不知道自己在这些领域能够做到什么程度。[2]

说实话，这种懵懂无知也情有可原。这些事情本来就难以预测，而且也没人提醒你需要考虑这些。如果你志向远大，别人会建议你上大学，这建议确实不错，但通常也就到此为止了。没人会告诉你该如何找到适合自己的事业，也没人提醒你这个过程会有多么困难。

面对不确定的未来，该怎么办？最好的办法就是让未来变得更明朗一些。而实现这一点的最佳方式，可能就是尝试去做那些让你感兴趣的事情。这样你就能更清楚地了解自己到底有多喜欢这件事、自己是否擅长，以及这条路能带给你多大的发展空间。

别总是在等待时机。不要等到大学毕业才开始思考职业方向，也不要把希望都寄托在在校期间的实习机会上。比如说，你想做编程，其实不一定非要等找到程序员的工作才能开始；你完全可以自己动手先试试看。因为找到真正适合自己的事业可能需要好几年时间，所以越早开始探索越好。

有个判断工作的实用小技巧：看看你未来的同事都是什么样的人。因为共事久了，你终究会变得和他们相似。那么问问自己：你想成为那样的人吗？

实际上，不同工作性质之间的差异会被进一步放大，这是因为每个人都在面临与你相同的选择。如果你选择一份工作仅仅是因为它待遇优厚，你就会发现自己被同样为此选择这份工作的人所包围，这会让工作变得比从外表看起来更加令人倦怠和痛苦。相反，如果你选择真正感兴趣的工作，你就会被其他同样对这份工作充满热情的人所环绕，这反而会让工作变得更具激励和启发性。[3]

在面对不确定性时，还有另一个重要的决策原则，那就是做出能够应对不确定性的选择。你对未来方向越是迷茫，就越应该选择那些能为你打开更多可能性的道路。我把这称为「上游策略」。举个例子，如果你在数学和经济学专业之间犹豫不决，那就选择数学；因为数学相当于是经济学的上游学科，日后从数学转向经济学要比从经济学转向数学容易得多。

在一种情况下，我们很容易判断是否应该投入到最感兴趣的领域：那就是当你想要做出卓越成就的时候。这虽然不是取得卓越成就的充分条件，但确实是必要条件。

关于「追寻内心热爱」的建议中其实存在着普遍的认知偏差，这就是其中的原因。这类建议大多来自那些已经功成名就的人，如果你向这些成功人士请教他们是如何获得今天的成就的，大多数人都会告诉你：一定要专注于自己最感兴趣的事情。这个观点确实有其道理。

但这并不意味着这样的建议适用于所有人。毕竟不是每个人都有能力或者渴望创造非凡的成就。不过，如果你确实有这样的追求，那么是否要投入到最感兴趣领域这个看似复杂的问题就变得简单了。答案是肯定的。因为卓越成就的根源在于一种充满抱负的求知欲，而这种品质是无法刻意培养的。

### Notes

[1] These examples show why it's a mistake to assume that economic inequality must be evidence of some kind of brokenness or unfairness. It's obvious that different people have different interests, and that some interests yield far more money than others, so how can it not be obvious that some people will end up much richer than others? In a world where some people like to write enterprise software and others like to make studio pottery, economic inequality is the natural outcome.

[2] Difficulty choosing between interests is a different matter. That's not always due to ignorance. It's often intrinsically difficult. I still have trouble doing it.

[3] You can't always take people at their word on this. Since it's more prestigious to work on things you're interested in than to be driven by money, people who are driven mainly by money will often claim to be more interested in their work than they actually are. One way to test such claims is by doing the following thought experiment: if their work didn't pay well, would they take day jobs doing something else in order to do it in their spare time? Lots of mathematicians and scientists and engineers would. Historically lots have. But I don't think as many investment bankers would.

This thought experiment is also useful for distinguishing between university departments.
