[Life is Short](https://paulgraham.com/vb.html)

January 2016

Life is short, as everyone knows. When I was a kid I used to wonder about this. Is life actually short, or are we really complaining about its finiteness? Would we be just as likely to feel life was short if we lived 10 times as long?

Since there didn't seem any way to answer this question, I stopped wondering about it. Then I had kids. That gave me a way to answer the question, and the answer is that life actually is short.

Having kids showed me how to convert a continuous quantity, time, into discrete quantities. You only get 52 weekends with your 2 year old. If Christmas-as-magic lasts from say ages 3 to 10, you only get to watch your child experience it 8 times. And while it's impossible to say what is a lot or a little of a continuous quantity like time, 8 is not a lot of something. If you had a handful of 8 peanuts, or a shelf of 8 books to choose from, the quantity would definitely seem limited, no matter what your lifespan was.

Ok, so life actually is short. Does it make any difference to know that?

It has for me. It means arguments of the form "Life is too short for x" have great force. It's not just a figure of speech to say that life is too short for something. It's not just a synonym for annoying. If you find yourself thinking that life is too short for something, you should try to eliminate it if you can.

When I ask myself what I've found life is too short for, the word that pops into my head is "bullshit." I realize that answer is somewhat tautological. It's almost the definition of bullshit that it's the stuff that life is too short for. And yet bullshit does have a distinctive character. There's something fake about it. It's the junk food of experience. [1]

If you ask yourself what you spend your time on that's bullshit, you probably already know the answer. Unnecessary meetings, pointless disputes, bureaucracy, posturing, dealing with other people's mistakes, traffic jams, addictive but unrewarding pastimes.

There are two ways this kind of thing gets into your life: it's either forced on you, or it tricks you. To some extent you have to put up with the bullshit forced on you by circumstances. You need to make money, and making money consists mostly of errands. Indeed, the law of supply and demand ensures that: the more rewarding some kind of work is, the cheaper people will do it. It may be that less bullshit is forced on you than you think, though. There has always been a stream of people who opt out of the default grind and go live somewhere where opportunities are fewer in the conventional sense, but life feels more authentic. This could become more common.

You can do it on a smaller scale without moving. The amount of time you have to spend on bullshit varies between employers. Most large organizations (and many small ones) are steeped in it. But if you consciously prioritize bullshit avoidance over other factors like money and prestige, you can probably find employers that will waste less of your time.

If you're a freelancer or a small company, you can do this at the level of individual customers. If you fire or avoid toxic customers, you can decrease the amount of bullshit in your life by more than you decrease your income.

But while some amount of bullshit is inevitably forced on you, the bullshit that sneaks into your life by tricking you is no one's fault but your own. And yet the bullshit you choose may be harder to eliminate than the bullshit that's forced on you. Things that lure you into wasting your time have to be really good at tricking you. An example that will be familiar to a lot of people is arguing online. When someone contradicts you, they're in a sense attacking you. Sometimes pretty overtly. Your instinct when attacked is to defend yourself. But like a lot of instincts, this one wasn't designed for the world we now live in. Counterintuitive as it feels, it's better most of the time not to defend yourself. Otherwise these people are literally taking your life. [2]

Arguing online is only incidentally addictive. There are more dangerous things than that. As I've written before, one byproduct of technical progress is that things we like tend to become more addictive. Which means we will increasingly have to make a conscious effort to avoid addictions — to stand outside ourselves and ask "is this how I want to be spending my time?"

As well as avoiding bullshit, one should actively seek out things that matter. But different things matter to different people, and most have to learn what matters to them. A few are lucky and realize early on that they love math or taking care of animals or writing, and then figure out a way to spend a lot of time doing it. But most people start out with a life that's a mix of things that matter and things that don't, and only gradually learn to distinguish between them.

For the young especially, much of this confusion is induced by the artificial situations they find themselves in. In middle school and high school, what the other kids think of you seems the most important thing in the world. But when you ask adults what they got wrong at that age, nearly all say they cared too much what other kids thought of them.

One heuristic for distinguishing stuff that matters is to ask yourself whether you'll care about it in the future. Fake stuff that matters usually has a sharp peak of seeming to matter. That's how it tricks you. The area under the curve is small, but its shape jabs into your consciousness like a pin.

The things that matter aren't necessarily the ones people would call "important." Having coffee with a friend matters. You won't feel later like that was a waste of time.

One great thing about having small children is that they make you spend time on things that matter: them. They grab your sleeve as you're staring at your phone and say "will you play with me?" And odds are that is in fact the bullshit-minimizing option.

If life is short, we should expect its shortness to take us by surprise. And that is just what tends to happen. You take things for granted, and then they're gone. You think you can always write that book, or climb that mountain, or whatever, and then you realize the window has closed. The saddest windows close when other people die. Their lives are short too. After my mother died, I wished I'd spent more time with her. I lived as if she'd always be there. And in her typical quiet way she encouraged that illusion. But an illusion it was. I think a lot of people make the same mistake I did.

The usual way to avoid being taken by surprise by something is to be consciously aware of it. Back when life was more precarious, people used to be aware of death to a degree that would now seem a bit morbid. I'm not sure why, but it doesn't seem the right answer to be constantly reminding oneself of the grim reaper hovering at everyone's shoulder. Perhaps a better solution is to look at the problem from the other end. Cultivate a habit of impatience about the things you most want to do. Don't wait before climbing that mountain or writing that book or visiting your mother. You don't need to be constantly reminding yourself why you shouldn't wait. Just don't wait.

I can think of two more things one does when one doesn't have much of something: try to get more of it, and savor what one has. Both make sense here.

How you live affects how long you live. Most people could do better. Me among them.

But you can probably get even more effect by paying closer attention to the time you have. It's easy to let the days rush by. The "flow" that imaginative people love so much has a darker cousin that prevents you from pausing to savor life amid the daily slurry of errands and alarms. One of the most striking things I've read was not in a book, but the title of one: James Salter's Burning the Days.

It is possible to slow time somewhat. I've gotten better at it. Kids help. When you have small children, there are a lot of moments so perfect that you can't help noticing.

It does help too to feel that you've squeezed everything out of some experience. The reason I'm sad about my mother is not just that I miss her but that I think of all the things we could have done that we didn't. My oldest son will be 7 soon. And while I miss the 3 year old version of him, I at least don't have any regrets over what might have been. We had the best time a daddy and a 3 year old ever had.

Relentlessly prune bullshit, don't wait to do things that matter, and savor the time you have. That's what you do when life is short.

生命很短暂，这话谁都知道。小时候，我经常想这个问题：生命真的短暂吗？还是我们只是在感叹生命终有尽头？假如我们的寿命能延长十倍，我们是否还会觉得生命短暂？

因为找不到答案，我就不再纠结这个问题了。直到我有了孩子。有了孩子让我找到了答案，而这个答案是：生命确实很短暂。

养育孩子让我懂得了如何把抽象的时间转化成具体的数字。和两岁的孩子相处，你总共只有 52 个周末的时光。如果说孩子们感受圣诞节神奇美好的年龄是在 3 岁到 10 岁之间，你就只能陪着孩子经历 8 次这样的美好时刻。虽然我们很难说时间的长短是多是少，但「8」这个数字绝对算不上多。就像你手里只有 8 颗花生，或者书架上只有 8 本书可选，不管你活多久，这个数量都显得太少了。

既然生命真的很短暂，那么认识到这一点对我们来说又有什么意义呢？

对我来说确实如此。「生命太短暂不该浪费在某事上」这种说法具有很强的说服力。这并不仅仅是一个修辞手法，也不仅是表达厌烦的另一种说法。如果你发现自己觉得生命太短暂不该浪费在某事上，那就应该尽可能地避免这些事。

当我扪心自问生命太短暂不该浪费在什么事情上时，「无用功」（bullshit）这个词立即跳入我的脑海。我知道这个答案听起来有点像绕圈子，因为「无用功」本身就可以定义为那些生命太短暂不值得浪费时间的事情。但无用功确实有其特别之处，它们总是带着一种虚假的性质，就像精神生活中的垃圾食品一样。[1]

如果你问问自己平时在哪些无用功上浪费时间，答案可能已经呼之欲出：那些不必要的会议、无谓的争吵、繁琐的官僚流程、表面功夫、收拾别人的烂摊子、交通堵塞，还有那些让人欲罢不能却毫无意义的消遣活动。

这种情况会以两种方式进入你的生活：要么被强制接受，要么在不知不觉中陷入其中。在某种程度上，你必须接受现实环境强加给你的繁文缛节。你需要谋生，而谋生往往充斥着各种琐事。实际上，供需规律决定了这一点：一份工作越有意义和价值，就越会有人愿意以更低的报酬去做它。不过，也许强加在你身上的无谓事务并没有你想象的那么多。历史上一直都有一些人选择摆脱常规的工作生活，去一些虽然在传统意义上机会较少，但生活更为真实的地方。这种选择可能会越来越普遍。

你不必搬家也能在小范围内作出改变。不同的雇主会占用你不同程度的时间去处理这些无谓事务。大多数大型组织（以及许多小型组织）都充斥着繁文缛节。但是，如果你能有意识地把避免这些无谓事务放在金钱和声望等因素之前，你很可能找到一个不会过多浪费你时间的雇主。

作为一名自由职业者或小型公司，你完全可以从个别客户层面来控制这一点。通过疏远或解雇那些有毒性的客户，你减少生活中无价值事物的程度往往会超过收入的损失。

虽然有些无谓的事情难免会被强加到你身上，但那些悄悄潜入你生活中、通过欺骗你而存在的琐事，责任其实在于你自己。有趣的是，这些你主动选择的干扰往往比被强加的还要难以摆脱。毕竟，能够诱使你浪费时间的事物，一定都很擅长欺骗你。举个很多人都熟悉的例子：在网上争论。当别人反驳你时，某种程度上就是在攻击你，有时这种攻击还相当直接。面对攻击时，人的本能反应就是自我防卫。但和许多本能一样，这种反应并不适合我们现在所处的世界。虽然这听起来违反直觉，但在大多数情况下，选择不去防卫反而更明智。否则，这些人实际上就是在消耗你的生命。[2]

网上争论的成瘾性其实只是表象，还有更多更危险的事物。正如我之前所写的，随着技术的进步，我们喜欢的事物往往会变得更容易让人沉迷。这意味着我们需要越来越多地主动努力避免成瘾 —— 需要时不时跳出当下的状态，问问自己「这真的是我希望投入时间的事情吗？」

除了远离无意义的事情，我们还应该主动寻找真正有价值的事物。不过对于不同的人来说，什么是有价值的往往大不相同，而且大多数人都需要经过一段时间才能找到对自己真正重要的事物。有些幸运的人很早就发现了自己对数学、照顾动物或写作的热爱，并找到了把大量时间投入其中的方法。但大多数人在生活初期，重要的事物和无关紧要的事情都参杂其中，只能在经历中慢慢学会区分它们。

这种困惑在年轻人中尤为明显，很大程度上是因为他们所处的非自然社交环境。在初中和高中，别人的眼光似乎就是整个世界的全部。但当你问成年人他们在那个年纪最大的误区是什么，几乎所有人都会说：太在意同龄人的看法了。

判断一件事是否真正重要的简单方法，就是问问自己将来是否还会在意它。那些表面上看起来重要的事情，往往会在某一时刻给你一种异常重要的错觉。这正是它们欺骗你的方式。就像一根细针，虽然实际影响微乎其微，却能在你的心上狠狠地戳一下。

真正值得关注的事情，未必是人们口中所谓的「要事」。比如和朋友一起喝杯咖啡聊聊天，这就很重要。回想起来，你永远不会觉得这是在浪费时间。

养育小孩有个很棒的好处，就是他们会迫使你把时间用在真正重要的事情上：陪伴他们。当你盯着手机时，他们会拉着你的衣袖问：「你能陪我玩吗？」而实际上，放下手机陪孩子玩耍，往往就是最明智的选择。

生命是短暂的，而这种短暂往往在我们措手不及时才会醒悟。事情总是这样发生：我们习惯把一切视为理所当然，等到失去时才追悔莫及。我们总以为将来有的是时间去写那本书，去攀登那座山，去完成那些想做的事，直到有一天突然发现，机会已经悄然溜走。最让人心痛的，莫过于失去身边的人。他们的生命同样短暂。母亲离世后，我多么希望当初能多陪陪她。我一直以为她会永远在我身边，而她也总是那么平静地默许着我这种想法。但这终究是一场幻觉。我想，很多人都和我一样，犯了同样的错误。

要避免被某件事情弄得措不及防，最常用的方法就是始终保持警觉。在过去生活更加艰难的年代，人们对死亡的关注程度会达到现在看来似乎有些过分的地步。我不确定具体原因，但是时刻提醒自己死亡就在身边这种做法似乎并非正确答案。也许我们可以换个角度来思考这个问题。对于那些你最想做的事情，培养一种马上行动的习惯。无论是登那座山，写那本书，还是看望母亲，都不要等待。你不需要不断提醒自己为什么不该等待，只要记住：别等待。

当一个人拥有的某样东西不多时，通常会有两种反应：努力获取更多，以及珍惜已有的。这两种态度在这里都很有意义。

生活方式直接影响寿命长短。大多数人都还有改进的空间，我也不例外。

但是如果你能更用心地关注自己拥有的时间，可能会有更深刻的体会。时光总是容易悄然流逝。富有想象力的人们所热爱的「心流」（flow）状态也有其消极的一面，它可能让我们在忙于日常琐事和各种提醒中忘记停下脚步享受生活。我读过的最震撼人心的话，并非来自书中的内容，而是来自一本书的书名：James Salter 的《燃烧的日子》。

我们确实可以让时间过得稍慢一些。我在这方面已经做得更好了。有了孩子会很有帮助。当你有小孩的时候，总会遇到一些美好到让你情不自禁想要驻足的瞬间。

当你觉得自己充分体验了某段经历，也会让人感到欣慰。我为母亲感到难过，不仅是因为想念她，更是因为想到了那些我们本可以做却没有做的事情。我的大儿子快 7 岁了。虽然我怀念他 3 岁时的模样，但至少对于那段时光，我没有任何遗憾。我们共同度过了一个父亲和 3 岁孩子所能拥有的最美好时光。

坚决摒除无意义的事务，不要迟迟不去做重要的事，好好珍惜你所拥有的时间。这就是面对短暂人生时我们应有的态度。

### Notes

[1] At first I didn't like it that the word that came to mind was one that had other meanings. But then I realized the other meanings are fairly closely related. Bullshit in the sense of things you waste your time on is a lot like intellectual bullshit.

[2] I chose this example deliberately as a note to self. I get attacked a lot online. People tell the craziest lies about me. And I have so far done a pretty mediocre job of suppressing the natural human inclination to say "Hey, that's not true!"
