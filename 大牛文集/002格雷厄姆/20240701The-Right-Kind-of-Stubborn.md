恰到好处的执着

Successful people tend to be persistent. New ideas often don't work at first, but they're not deterred. They keep trying and eventually find something that does.

成功人士往往有一个共同特点：他们特别能坚持。当新想法刚提出时，常常不能马上见效，但这并不会让他们轻易放弃。相反，他们会不断尝试，反复摸索，直到找到真正有用的方法。这种锲而不舍的精神，正是他们最终取得成功的关键。

Mere obstinacy, on the other hand, is a recipe for failure. Obstinate people are so annoying. They won't listen. They beat their heads against a wall and get nowhere.

相反，纯粹的固执往往是通向失败的捷径。固执己见的人常常让人感到不快。他们充耳不闻他人建议，只知一味地钻牛角尖，最终却毫无收获。

But is there any real difference between these two cases? Are persistent and obstinate people actually behaving differently? Or are they doing the same thing, and we just label them later as persistent or obstinate depending on whether they turned out to be right or not?

但是，这两种情况之间真的存在本质区别吗？那些被称为「坚持」的人和被认为「固执」的人，他们的行为模式真的不同吗？还是说，其实他们做的是同一件事，只是我们根据最终结果的对错来为他们贴上不同的标签？换句话说，我们是不是在事后才判断一个人是「坚持不懈」还是「固执己见」，这完全取决于他们的坚持是否最终被证明是正确的？

If that's the only difference then there's nothing to be learned from the distinction. Telling someone to be persistent rather than obstinate would just be telling them to be right rather than wrong, and they already know that. Whereas if persistence and obstinacy are actually different kinds of behavior, it would be worthwhile to tease them apart. [1]

如果坚持和固执之间仅仅存在对错的差异，那么这种区分就没有什么实际意义。仅仅告诉别人「要坚持，不要固执」等同于告诉他们「要做对的事，不要做错的事"—— 这显然是人尽皆知的道理。然而，如果坚持和固执实际上代表了两种不同类型的行为模式，那么深入分析并区分这两者就变得非常有价值了。[1]

I've talked to a lot of determined people, and it seems to me that they're different kinds of behavior. I've often walked away from a conversation thinking either "Wow, that guy is determined" or "Damn, that guy is stubborn," and I don't think I'm just talking about whether they seemed right or not. That's part of it, but not all of it.

我曾与许多意志坚定的人交谈过，我发现他们展现出了不同类型的行为。我经常在结束谈话后会有这样的想法："哇，这个人真是意志坚定」或者「唉，这个人真是顽固不化」。我并不认为我仅仅是在判断他们的观点是否正确。这确实是其中的一个因素，但绝不是全部。

There's something annoying about the obstinate that's not simply due to being mistaken. They won't listen. And that's not true of all determined people. I can't think of anyone more determined than the Collison brothers, and when you point out a problem to them, they not only listen, but listen with an almost predatory intensity. Is there a hole in the bottom of their boat? Probably not, but if there is, they want to know about it.

固执己见的人有一种令人烦恼的特质，这并不仅仅是因为他们的观点可能是错误的。更让人不快的是，他们往往不愿意听取他人的意见。然而，并非所有意志坚定的人都是如此。以 Collison 兄弟（知名科技企业家）为例，我实在想不出还有谁比他们更加坚定不移。有趣的是，当你向他们指出一个问题时，他们不仅会认真倾听，甚至会以一种异常专注的态度深入思考。就好像你问他们："你们的事业中是否存在隐患？」虽然答案很可能是否定的，但如果真的存在问题，他们会非常渴望了解。这种求知若渴、直面挑战的态度，正是他们与一般固执己见者的根本区别。

It's the same with most successful people. They're never more engaged than when you disagree with them. Whereas the obstinate don't want to hear you. When you point out problems, their eyes glaze over, and their replies sound like ideologues talking about matters of doctrine. [2]

这一点在大多数成功人士身上也是如此。当你与他们意见相左时，他们反而会表现出最高涨的兴致。相比之下，那些固守己见的人则不愿意听取他人的意见。当你指出问题时，他们的目光会变得茫然，他们的回答听起来就像是一些教条主义者在谈论意识形态一样空洞。[2]

The reason the persistent and the obstinate seem similar is that they're both hard to stop. But they're hard to stop in different senses. The persistent are like boats whose engines can't be throttled back. The obstinate are like boats whose rudders can't be turned. [3]

坚持不懈和固执己见看似相似，原因在于它们都难以被阻止。然而，这两种特质难以阻止的方式却大不相同。坚持不懈的人就像一艘引擎无法降速的船，总是全速前进；而固执己见的人则如同一艘舵无法转向的船，始终保持原有方向。[3]

In the degenerate case they're indistinguishable: when there's only one way to solve a problem, your only choice is whether to give up or not, and persistence and obstinacy both say no. This is presumably why the two are so often conflated in popular culture. It assumes simple problems. But as problems get more complicated, we can see the difference between them. The persistent are much more attached to points high in the decision tree than to minor ones lower down, while the obstinate spray "don't give up" indiscriminately over the whole tree.

在最简单的情况下，坚持和固执是难以区分的：当解决问题只有一种方法时，你唯一的选择就是放弃还是继续，而坚持和固执都会选择继续。这大概就是为什么在大众文化中，比如电影或小说里，这两种品质常常被混为一谈的原因。这种混淆通常基于问题很简单的假设。然而，随着问题变得越来越复杂，我们就能看出它们之间的差异了。

想象一下解决问题的过程像是在攀爬一棵决策树。在这个比喻中，坚持的人更关注决策树顶端的关键选择点，而不太在意树下层的次要决定。相比之下，固执的人则会在整棵决策树上毫无区别地坚持「永不放弃」的态度。

这种差异揭示了坚持和固执在面对复杂问题时的本质区别：坚持需要战略性思考和灵活性，而固执则可能导致盲目和僵化的行为。

The persistent are attached to the goal. The obstinate are attached to their ideas about how to reach it.

Worse still, that means they'll tend to be attached to their first ideas about how to solve a problem, even though these are the least informed by the experience of working on it. So the obstinate aren't merely attached to details, but disproportionately likely to be attached to wrong ones.

有恒心的人专注于目标。顽固的人则执着于他们认为达成目标的方法。

更令人担忧的是，这意味着顽固的人往往会固守他们最初解决问题的想法，尽管这些想法往往是最缺乏实践经验支撑的。因此，顽固的人不仅仅是拘泥于细节，更可能过分坚持那些错误的细节。

Why are they like this? Why are the obstinate obstinate? One possibility is that they're overwhelmed. They're not very capable. They take on a hard problem. They're immediately in over their head. So they grab onto ideas the way someone on the deck of a rolling ship might grab onto the nearest handhold.

他们为什么会这样呢？为什么有些人会如此固执己见？一种可能性是他们感到不知所措。这些人可能能力有限，却偏偏遇到了一个棘手的问题。结果一上来就觉得自己完全招架不住。于是，他们就像站在颠簸的船只甲板上的人一样，急于抓住身边最近的扶手 —— 在这里，这个「扶手」就是他们能想到的任何想法。

That was my initial theory, but on examination it doesn't hold up. If being obstinate were simply a consequence of being in over one's head, you could make persistent people become obstinate by making them solve harder problems. But that's not what happens. If you handed the Collisons an extremely hard problem to solve, they wouldn't become obstinate. If anything they'd become less obstinate. They'd know they had to be open to anything.

这是我最初的想法，但仔细分析后发现并不成立。如果固执只是因为一个人遇到了超出自己能力的事情，那么你就可以通过给那些坚毅的人更难的问题来让他们变得固执。但现实并非如此。如果你给 Collisons 兄弟（著名的年轻企业家）一个极其棘手的问题去解决，他们不会变得固执。恰恰相反，他们可能会变得更加开明。他们会意识到必须对各种可能性持开放态度。

Similarly, if obstinacy were caused by the situation, the obstinate would stop being obstinate when solving easier problems. But they don't. And if obstinacy isn't caused by the situation, it must come from within. It must be a feature of one's personality.

同理，如果固执是由外部环境引起的，那么当面对较为简单的问题时，固执的人应该会变得不那么顽固。然而事实并非如此。既然固执并非由外部环境所致，那么它必定源自个人内在。换句话说，固执很可能是一个人性格特征的体现。

Obstinacy is a reflexive resistance to changing one's ideas. This is not identical with stupidity, but they're closely related. A reflexive resistance to changing one's ideas becomes a sort of induced stupidity as contrary evidence mounts. And obstinacy is a form of not giving up that's easily practiced by the stupid. You don't have to consider complicated tradeoffs; you just dig in your heels. It even works, up to a point.

顽固是一种对改变自己想法的本能抗拒。虽然它与愚蠢并非完全等同，但两者确实密切相关。随着与之相悖的证据不断积累，这种对改变想法的本能抗拒逐渐演变成一种自我诱导的愚蠢。同时，顽固也是一种容易被愚钝之人采用的坚持方式。采取这种态度无需权衡复杂的利弊得失，只需要固守己见就行。有趣的是，这种方式在某种程度上甚至是行之有效的，尽管它显然有其局限性。

The fact that obstinacy works for simple problems is an important clue. Persistence and obstinacy aren't opposites. The relationship between them is more like the relationship between the two kinds of respiration we can do: aerobic respiration, and the anaerobic respiration we inherited from our most distant ancestors. Anaerobic respiration is a more primitive process, but it has its uses. When you leap suddenly away from a threat, that's what you're using.

固执在解决简单问题时往往行之有效，这一现象为我们提供了一个重要的启示。实际上，坚持和固执并非对立的概念，它们之间的关系更类似于我们体内两种呼吸方式之间的关系：有氧呼吸（aerobic respiration）和无氧呼吸（anaerobic respiration），后者是我们从远古祖先那里继承而来的。尽管无氧呼吸是一种更为原始的生理过程，但它在某些情况下仍然发挥着重要作用。举个例子，当你遇到威胁需要迅速逃离时，你的身体就会启动无氧呼吸机制。这个比喻恰好说明了固执虽然看似简单，但在某些特定情况下可能比复杂的思考方式更为有效。

The optimal amount of obstinacy is not zero. It can be good if your initial reaction to a setback is an unthinking "I won't give up," because this helps prevent panic. But unthinking only gets you so far. The further someone is toward the obstinate end of the continuum, the less likely they are to succeed in solving hard problems. [4]

适度的固执是有益的。当遇到挫折时，如果你的第一反应是不假思索地说「我不会放弃」，这其实是件好事，因为它能帮你避免陷入恐慌。然而，单凭固执态度并不能让你走得太远。在「固执 - 灵活」这个光谱上，一个人越是倾向于固执的一端，他在解决复杂问题时就越难取得成功。[4]

Obstinacy is a simple thing. Animals have it. But persistence turns out to have a fairly complicated internal structure.

One thing that distinguishes the persistent is their energy. At the risk of putting too much weight on words, they persist rather than merely resisting. They keep trying things. Which means the persistent must also be imaginative. To keep trying things, you have to keep thinking of things to try.

固执是一种简单的特质，即使是动物也会表现出来。然而，坚持不懈却被证明具有相当复杂的内在机制。

坚持不懈的人有一个显著特征，那就是他们充满动力。为了更准确地描述，我们可以说他们是在积极地坚持，而不仅仅是被动地抵抗。他们不断尝试各种可能性。这意味着坚持不懈的人还必须富有想象力。要持续探索新的方法，你就必须不断地构思新的尝试。这两种能力是相辅相成的：持续的尝试激发想象力，而丰富的想象力又支持不断的尝试。

Energy and imagination make a wonderful combination. Each gets the best out of the other. Energy creates demand for the ideas produced by imagination, which thus produces more, and imagination gives energy somewhere to go. [5]

能量和想象力堪称完美搭档。它们相互成就，相得益彰。能量为想象力孕育的创意提供了用武之地，进而激发出更多奇思妙想；而想象力则为能量指明了前进的方向。[5]

Merely having energy and imagination is quite rare. But to solve hard problems you need three more qualities: resilience, good judgement, and a focus on some kind of goal.

拥有充沛的精力和丰富的想象力已经是相当罕见的特质了。然而，要解决棘手的问题，你还需要具备另外三个关键品质：坚韧不拔的毅力、敏锐的判断力，以及对特定目标的专注。

Resilience means not having one's morale destroyed by setbacks. Setbacks are inevitable once problems reach a certain size, so if you can't bounce back from them, you can only do good work on a small scale. But resilience is not the same as obstinacy. Resilience means setbacks can't change your morale, not that they can't change your mind.

心理韧性是指面对挫折时不会丧失斗志。当问题变得复杂时，挫折往往不可避免。如果你无法从挫折中恢复过来，那么你只能在小范围内做出成绩。但是，心理韧性并不等同于固守己见。心理韧性意味着挫折不能动摇你的决心，但这并不意味着你不能因此改变想法。

Indeed, persistence often requires that one change one's mind. That's where good judgement comes in. The persistent are quite rational. They focus on expected value. It's this, not recklessness, that lets them work on things that are unlikely to succeed.

事实上，真正的坚持往往需要我们不断调整自己的思维方式。这就是为什么良好的判断力如此重要。具有坚持精神的人通常都很理性，他们会把注意力集中在预期收益（expected value）上。正是这种对预期收益的关注，而非盲目冒进，使他们能够勇于尝试那些成功几率看似渺茫的事业。

There is one point at which the persistent are often irrational though: at the very top of the decision tree. When they choose between two problems of roughly equal expected value, the choice usually comes down to personal preference. Indeed, they'll often classify projects into deliberately wide bands of expected value in order to ensure that the one they want to work on still qualifies.

有一个有趣的现象：那些坚持不懈的人在面对最高层次的决策时，往往会表现得不那么理性。当他们需要在两个预期价值大致相当的问题之间做出选择时，最终的决定通常取决于个人偏好。实际上，这些人常常会刻意将项目划分到较宽泛的预期价值区间内，这样做的目的是确保他们想要投入的项目仍然符合筛选标准。

这种行为反映了一个有趣的心理现象：即使是在追求理性决策的过程中，人们也会找到方法来合理化自己的主观偏好。通过扩大价值评估的范围，他们为自己的选择提供了更大的灵活性，同时还能保持决策过程的表面合理性。这种做法揭示了人类决策过程中理性与感性的微妙平衡，以及我们如何在追求客观的同时仍然保留个人偏好的影响力。

Empirically this doesn't seem to be a problem. It's ok to be irrational near the top of the decision tree. One reason is that we humans will work harder on a problem we love. But there's another more subtle factor involved as well: our preferences among problems aren't random. When we love a problem that other people don't, it's often because we've unconsciously noticed that it's more important than they realize.

实际上，这种情况似乎并不会造成问题。在做重大决策时，即使不够理性也无妨。这背后有两个原因。首先，我们人类往往会在自己热爱的问题上投入更多精力。其次，还有一个不太明显但同样重要的因素：我们对不同问题的偏好并非完全随机。当我们热衷于某个大多数人不感兴趣的问题时，很可能是因为我们潜意识里已经察觉到了这个问题比其他人认识到的更加重要。

Which leads to our fifth quality: there needs to be some overall goal. If you're like me you began, as a kid, merely with the desire to do something great. In theory that should be the most powerful motivator of all, since it includes everything that could possibly be done. But in practice it's not much use, precisely because it includes too much. It doesn't tell you what to do at this moment.

这就引出了我们的第五个特质：需要有一个总体目标。如果你跟我有相似经历，你可能在小时候就萌生了想要做出一番大事的愿望。从理论上讲，这应该是最强大的动力，因为它涵盖了所有可能实现的事情。但实际上，正是因为它包罗万象，反而不太管用。它无法指导你当下应该采取什么行动。

So in practice your energy and imagination and resilience and good judgement have to be directed toward some fairly specific goal. Not too specific, or you might miss a great discovery adjacent to what you're searching for, but not too general, or it won't work to motivate you. [6]

因此，在实际操作中，你需要将自己的精力、创造力、韧性和判断力集中在一个相对明确的目标上。这个目标不宜过于具体，否则你可能会忽视与你的研究方向相关的重大发现；但也不能过于宽泛，否则难以激发你的动力。[6]

When you look at the internal structure of persistence, it doesn't resemble obstinacy at all. It's so much more complex. Five distinct qualities — energy, imagination, resilience, good judgement, and focus on a goal — combine to produce a phenomenon that seems a bit like obstinacy in the sense that it causes you not to give up. But the way you don't give up is completely different. Instead of merely resisting change, you're driven toward a goal by energy and resilience, through paths discovered by imagination and optimized by judgement. You'll give way on any point low down in the decision tree, if its expected value drops sufficiently, but energy and resilience keep pushing you toward whatever you chose higher up.

当你深入探究坚持不懈的内在结构时，你会发现它与顽固固执完全不同，实际上要复杂得多。坚持不懈是由五种不同的品质共同构成的：动力、想象力、韧性、良好的判断力以及对目标的专注。这些品质结合在一起，产生了一种表面上看似固执的现象，因为它使人不轻易放弃。但是，这种不放弃的方式与固执截然不同。

在坚持不懈的过程中，你并非只是单纯地抗拒改变。相反，你被内在的动力和韧性驱使，朝着目标不断前进。在这个过程中，想象力为你开辟新的道路，而判断力则帮助你优化这些路径。

想象一个决策过程像一棵树，根部是最基本的决策，而枝叶则代表更细节的选择。在这个决策树中，如果较低层级的某个选项的预期收益显著下降，你会愿意在这一点上做出让步和调整。但是，你的内在动力和韧性会继续推动你朝着在决策树更高层所选定的重要目标前进。

这就是坚持不懈的真正含义：它不是固执己见，而是在保持灵活性的同时，始终朝着最重要的目标努力。

Considering what it's made of, it's not surprising that the right kind of stubbornness is so much rarer than the wrong kind, or that it gets so much better results. Anyone can do obstinacy. Indeed, kids and drunks and fools are best at it. Whereas very few people have enough of all five of the qualities that produce the right kind of stubbornness, but when they do the results are magical.

如果我们仔细思考其本质，就不难理解为什么正面的固执如此罕见，而且能带来如此出色的结果。任何人都可以表现得顽固不化，实际上，小孩子、酒鬼和愚人在这方面往往表现得最为出色。然而，能够同时具备产生积极固执所需的全部五种品质的人却少之又少。不过，一旦有人真正具备了这些品质，其成果往往会令人叹为观止。

### Notes

[1] I'm going to use "persistent" for the good kind of stubborn and "obstinate" for the bad kind, but I can't claim I'm simply following current usage. Conventional opinion barely distinguishes between good and bad kinds of stubbornness, and usage is correspondingly promiscuous. I could have invented a new word for the good kind, but it seemed better just to stretch "persistent."

[2] There are some domains where one can succeed by being obstinate. Some political leaders have been notorious for it. But it won't work in situations where you have to pass external tests. And indeed the political leaders who are famous for being obstinate are famous for getting power, not for using it well.

[3] There will be some resistance to turning the rudder of a persistent person, because there's some cost to changing direction.

[4] The obstinate do sometimes succeed in solving hard problems. One way is through luck: like the stopped clock that's right twice a day, they seize onto some arbitrary idea, and it turns out to be right. Another is when their obstinacy cancels out some other form of error. For example, if a leader has overcautious subordinates, their estimates of the probability of success will always be off in the same direction. So if he mindlessly says "push ahead regardless" in every borderline case, he'll usually turn out to be right.

[5] If you stop there, at just energy and imagination, you get the conventional caricature of an artist or poet.

[6] Start by erring on the small side. If you're inexperienced you'll inevitably err on one side or the other, and if you err on the side of making the goal too broad, you won't get anywhere. Whereas if you err on the small side you'll at least be moving forward. Then, once you're moving, you expand the goal.
