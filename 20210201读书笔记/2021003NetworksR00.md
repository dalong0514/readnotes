### 0101. 主题卡 —— 判断同质还是异质的数学方法

In general, a network with heterogeneous connectivity has a set of clear hubs. When a graph is small, it is easy to find whether its connectivity is homogeneous or heterogeneous (Figure 8). In the first case, all the nodes have more or less the same connectivity, while in the latter it is easy to spot a few hubs. But when the network to be studied is very big (like the Internet, the Web, metabolic networks, and many others) things are not so easy. Fortunately, mathematics provides a way to find whether a magnitude is heterogeneous or homogeneous.

Let us start with a homogeneous magnitude, such as people’s height. In order to study the height of the students of a class, one can do as follows. First, make a row with those 1.50 to 1.55 metres tall: there will be a few of them. Then, make a parallel row with those 1.55 to 1.60: there will be some more and the row will be a little longer. Follow those with 1.60 to 1.65: more people will be in that row. Increasing by 5 centimetres in every row (Figure 9 left). At the end, the profile of the rows will have the shape of a bell curve : the number of students increases as height increases, then reaches the top around the average, and then starts to fall. The very tall and the very short are rare and the majority are in the middle. This curve provides the distribution of heights of the students.

Now, let us consider the number of social contacts of those same students. Now the rows correspond to those with 0 to 20 friends, 20 to 40, 40 to 60, and so on. The outcome of this procedure provides the distribution of the connectivity of the nodes of the social network, that is, the degree distribution of the graph. The resulting picture is very different from the case of heights (Figure 9 right). First of all, there will be many more rows, since there will be people with hundreds or thousands of friends. The majority of people will have some tens of contacts per person, but the resulting distribution will have a 'fat tail’. In other words, the distribution will be very skewed to the right, with a long or 'heavy tail’. Mathematically speaking, the shape of the degree distribution is well described by a curve called power law.

In homogeneous networks, the degree distribution is a bell curve, similar to that of height, while in heterogeneous networks, it is a power law, similar to that of friendships. The power law implies that there are many more hubs (and much more connected) in heterogeneous networks than in homogeneous ones. Moreover, hubs are not isolated exceptions: there is a full hierarchy of nodes, each of them being a hub compared with the less connected ones. Take once again the comparison of height and friendships. Probably there are several million people in the world who are 1.50 metres tall; however, if we double that height (3.00 metres), the number of people this tall is much smaller, most probably zero. On the other hand, tens of millions of people have, say, 20 friends in their social network. If we double that number (40 friends), there will be fewer (say a quarter of those with 20), but still millions. We can double the number many times, and the number will be reduced by about a quarter at every step (the actual rate of reduction depends on the slope of the power law). This explains, for example, the role of Mr Jones and Mr Brown in Milgram’s experiment: while Jacobs is the largest hub of the stockbroker’s social network, Jones and Brown are smaller hubs, but still well connected.

Looking at the degree distribution is the best way to check if a network is heterogeneous or not: if the distribution is fat tailed, then the network will have hubs and heterogeneity. A mathematically perfect power law is never found, because this would imply the existence of hubs with an infinite number of connections. However, no real network is infinitely big: this is why the fat tail of the degree distribution always has a cut-off at a maximum value for the degree. Indeed, the size of hubs can be limited by various costs of accumulating connections: for example, neurons cannot accumulate an arbitrary amount of connections, because of their physical and now represents a wide variety of topics in history, philosophy, religion, science, and the humanities. The VSI ve of the structure. In professional collaboration networks, time plays a role: connections cannot be accumulated indefinitely, because at a certain moment the career (or life) of an individual comes to an end. All these and other factors are reflected in the shape of the degree distribution. Nonetheless, a strongly skewed, fat-tailed distribution is a clear signal of heterogeneity, even if it is never a perfect power law.

One has to be careful in interpreting what hubs and fat tails mean. For example, some anthropologists believe that a magnitude called Dunbar number limits the number of social relations. According to this hypothesis the number of stable social bonds cannot increase much above 150. Anthropologist Robin Dunbar put forward this hypothesis in 1992 after finding evidence that the size of a part of the brain’s cortex of primates and humans may be related to that of their social groups. If this is true, what is the explanation of the hubs with thousands of connections found in many social networks? Some scientists think that they are instances of the pizza delivery guy problem. A pizza delivery guy receives many phone calls on his mobile, but just a tiny fraction of them come from real friends; the rest are clients. According to this concept, the majority of the links represented in the fat tail of the distribution would be fictitious in social networks. However, this depends on exactly what problem one wants to study. For example, if the pizza delivery guy catches flu, epidemiologists only care about how many people (friends or not) have been in contact with him.

On the other hand, not all networks are necessarily heterogeneous. While the small-world property is something intrinsic to networked structures, hubs are not present in all kind of networks. For example, power grids usually have very few of them. The same holds for some foodwebs, the neuronal network of the C. elegans, and the World Trade Web.

Finally, an interesting case is found in some directed networks, as in the case of, most genetic regulatory networks. If gene A regulates gene B, an arrow is drawn from A to B, but not necessarily from B to A. The out-degree distribution (that is, the distribution of the number of outcoming arrows) is usually fat tailed: that is, a few genes regulate large portions of the genome. However, the in-degree distribution (that of the number of incoming arrows) is much more homogeneous: just a few other genes regulate a single one. Heterogeneity is widespread in many networks, but when we approach an unknown system we must not take it for granted until we have checked it.

一般而言，具备异质连接性的网络都会有一组清晰的中心。当图很小时，我们很容易发现其内部连接是同质还是异质的（图 8）。在第一种情況下，所有节点多少具备相同的连接性，而在后者中则很容易发现少量枢纽节点。但是，当被研究的网络非常大（如互联网、万维网、代谢网络以及许多其他网络）时，事情就没那么简单了。幸运的是，数学提供了一种方法来确定一种量值是同质还是异质。

1-2『判断同质还是异质的数学方法：同质网络中所有节点的「度数」大致相同。另外一种表述形式：同质的数据符合正态分布模型，异质的数据符合幕律分布模型。做一张主题卡片。（2021-02-16）』——已完成

我们以同质量值为起点，比如人的身高。为了研究某班学生的身高，我们可以按照以下方法操作。首先，让那些身高在 1.50 到 1.55 米之间的学生排成一列：他们可能人数不多。然后，让那些身高在 1.55 到 1.60 米之间的学生平行地排成一列：这些人的数量会多些，队伍也会长些。接下来的一列为 1.60 到 1.65 米的学生：更多的人会出现在这一列。然后，每一列身高增加 5 厘米（图 9 左）。最后，这些列的轮廓将构成钟形曲线的形状：

学生的数量随着身高的增加而增加，然后在平均值附近达到峰值，接着开始下降。很高和很矮的学生都较少，大部分处于中间范围。这条曲线提供了学生的身高分布。

现在，我们来考虑这些学生的社交关系数量。这时，每一列分别对应 0 到 20 个朋友，20 到 40 个朋友，40 到 60 个朋友，以此类推。该过程的结果提供了社交网络节点的连接性分布，即图的度数分布。这个结果图与身高图的情况十分不同（图 9 右）。首先，图中的列会更多，因为有的人的朋友数量会成百上千。多数人的联系人为几十个，但由此产生的分布将具有「肥尾效应」。换言之，分布图的长尾或者说是「厚尾」将明显向右偏斜。从数学角度讲，度数分布的形状可通过幂律得到很好的描述。

在同质网络中，度数分布是类似于前述学生身高的钟形曲线，而在异质网络里，度数分布则遵循幂律，类似于朋友数量的分布图。幂律意昧着异质网络中存在着比同质网络更多的枢组节点（以及更多的连接数）。此外，枢节点并不是单独的例外：与连接数较少的网络相比，连接数较多的网络中有着完整的节点层级结构，每个节点都构成了一个枢纽。

再拿身高和朋友数量来说。世界上身高 1.50 米的人可能有数百万；然而，如果我们将这一高度翻倍（3 米），如此高度的人则少得多，很可能没有。另一方面，数干万人在其社交网络中有比如说 20 位朋友。如果我们将这个数字加倍（40 位朋友）拥有这个朋友数的人数则会少些（比如比加倍之前人数减少了 1/4）, 但仍有数百万。我们可将这个数字多次加倍，而对应的人数则每次减少约 1/4（实际少的速度取決于幂律的斜率）。这便解释了比如琼斯先生和布朗先生在米尔格拉姆实验中的作用：虽然雅各布是股票经纪人社交网络中的最大枢纽而琼斯和布朗是更小的枢纽，但与他们联系的人依然很多。

查看度数分布是检查网络是否为异质结构的最佳方法：如果度数分布呈肥尾，则该网络将有多个枢纽且为异质结构。人们从未发现某种数学上完美的幂律，因为这将意味着存在拥有无限连接数的枢纽。然而，不存在无限大的真实网络：这就是为何度数分布的肥尾总有一个度数最大值上限的原因。实际上，枢纽的大小会受到连接累积的各种成本的限制：例如，由于神经元的物理结构，神经元无法累积任意数量的连接。在专业协作网络中，时间起着某种作用：连接数无法无限累积，因为个体的事业（或生命）会在某个时刻终结。所有这些和其他因素都反映在度数分布的形状上。尽管如此，严重偏斜的肥尾状度数分布仍是异质网络的清楚信号，即便它从来都不是一个完美的幂律。

在解释枢纽和肥尾的含义时必须小心谨慎。例如，一些人类学家认为，一种叫邓巴数字的量值限制了人们的社交关系数量。根据这一假设，稳定的社交关系数量不能超过 150 这个数字太多。人类学家罗宾·邓巴在发现灵长类动物和人类的大脑皮质某部分的大小可能与它们的社会群组规模相关的证据之后，于 1992 年提出这一假设。如果这一假设为真，那又如何解释人们在许多社交网络中发现的有着上干联系人的社交枢纽呢？

一些科学家认为，这便是「披萨送货员问题」的实例。披萨送货员在自己的手机上会接到许多电话，但只有极少的一部分来自其真正的朋友；其余则为客户。根据这种想法，呈现在社交网络度数分布图肥尾处的多数连接都是泛泛之交。然而，这还得看人们究竟想研究什么问题。例如，如果披萨送货员得了流感，流行病学家只会关心有多少人（不管是不是朋友）曾与他有过接触。

另一方面，并非所有网络都是异质结构。尽管小世界属性是网络结构所固有的，但不是所有的网络中都会出现枢纽。例如，电网通常就仅有少量枢纽。还有一些食物网、线虫的神经网络以及世界贸易网络等都很少有枢纽存在。

最后，人们在一些有向网络中发现了一个有趣的情況，正如在多数基因调控网络中发现的那样。如果基因 A 调控基因 B，则箭头从 A 指向 B，但 B 不是一定要指向 A。出度分布（即朝外箭头数的分布）通常是肥尾状：少数基因调控大部分基因组。然而，入度分布（即朝内箭头数的分布）则均匀得多：少数其他基因调控某个基因。异质性在许多网络中都广泛存在，但当我们处理未知系统时，在检验之前我们不要理所当然地认为它就是异质网络。

### 0201. 术语卡 —— Degree

The lattice choice, albeit simpler with respect to a graph, introduces nevertheless a strong limitation. In fact, a lattice is suitable only for representing systems carefully designed or subject to strong constraints. These might be, for example, the arrays of processors in a computing cluster or verbal communications between chain workers in a noisy workplace. In lattices, every node is linked to a fixed number of nearest neighbours, while in the vast majority of real-world cases, links connect a variable number of elements, no matter whether close to or far away from each other. The ability to capture this disorder is one of the great advantages of the network approach.

Much of this disorder is encoded in a crucial quantity: the degree, that is, the number of edges attached to each node. If a node is a web page, the degree represents the number of links it receives from other pages. If a node is a species, the degree is the number of species it depends on for feeding. If a node is an individual, the degree is the number of acquaintances. This circle can be related to what sociologist Peter Marsden has called a core discussion network: the set of people (friends, partners, family members, current and past schoolmates, co-workers, neighbours, fellow members of clubs, professional advisers, consultants, etc.) with whom one discusses important matters or spends time.

尽管格子相对于图而言更加简单，但它引入了强烈的限制条件。事实上，一个格子仅适于呈现经过精心设计或受到强烈约束的系统。比如，这些系统可能是某个计算集群的处理器阵列，或者某个嘈杂工作场所中彼此关联的工人之间的语言交流。在格子框架中，每个节点都连接着固定数量的最近连接点，而在绝大多数真实情况中，这些连接则关联着数量可变的元素，无论它们彼此是邻近还是相隔很远。捕获这种混乱状态的能力是网络方法的最大优点之一。

大部分这种无序状态都被编码为某种关键的数量 一一 度数，即附着于每个节点之上的边数。如果节点是网页，度数则表示了该网页与其他页面的链接数量。如果节点是物种，度数则表示了该物种赖以生存的物种数量。如果节点是一个人，度数则表示了其熟人的数量。这个圏子能与社会学家彼得·马斯登所谓的核心讨论网络联系起来，即那些可与之讨论重要事宜或打发时间的人群（朋友、伙伴、家庭成员、现在和过去的同学、同事、邻居、俱乐部伙伴、专业顾问、咨询员等等）。

### 0202. 术语卡 —— 网络分析法（network approach）

印象：从个体到群体的一种分析方法。

There are two possible approaches when dealing with a situation where many different elements interact in different ways. In the first approach, we identify the basic constituents and interactions between them. By studying each element on its own, we can then deduce the behaviour of the system as the sum of its individual elements. For example, ecologists can describe the features of an ecosystem by listing prey and predators of every single species. Computer scientists describe a network of computers by focusing on the features and protocols of each different machine. Psychologists study social relations by describing the behaviour of each social actor in his or her circle. A second strategy, different from the first one, consists in putting many elements together into a few homogeneous groups. For example, sociologists and political scientists usually split society into social classes, genders, levels of education, ethnicities, nations, etc. Similarly, epidemiologists often separate the population into a limited set of compartments: healthy individuals, infected, immunized, etc. Ecologists can also use this approach by aggregating into groups (trophic species) all the species that have similar roles in a foodweb.

The network approach tries to complement these two points of view. Many phenomena are impossible to explain if one focuses only on the behaviour of individual elements. For example, the dynamics of a species population within an ecosystem do not depend on the features of that species alone: the global network of prey–predator interactions must be taken into account. On the other hand, focusing on big classes of elements may not be useful either. For example, the political phenomena taking place in a country are hardly the outcome of a pre-existing national identity but rather of the specific pattern of social relations within that country. The network approach is somewhere between the description by individual elements and the description by big groups, bridging the two of them. In a certain sense, networks try to explain how a set of isolated elements are transformed, through a pattern of interactions, into groups and communities. In all cases where this pattern is relevant, the network approach provides essential insights.

在处理多种不同元素以不同方式相互作用的情况时，存在两种可能的方法。第一种方法是确认这种情况中的基本成分以及它们之间的相互作用。通过研究每个元素本身，我们可以将系统的行为推导为个体元素的加总。例如，生态学家可以通过列出每个物种的猎物和捕食者来描述生态系统的特征。计算机科学家通过关注每个不同机器的特征和协议来描述计算机网络。心理学家则通过描述每个社交者在他的子中的行为来研究社会关系。与第一种策略不同，第二种策略旨在将许多元素组合成为若干同类的群体。例如，社会学家和政治学家通常按照社会阶层、性别、教育水平、种族、国家等因素对社会进行划分。同样，流行病学家则常常将人口分成一组有限的「区划」：健康的、感染的、免疫的个体等。生态学家也能用同样的方法将所有在食物网中扮演类似角色的物种汇集成群组（即营养物种）。

2『两种方式来处理多种不同元素以不同方式相互作用的系统（个体法、分组法），以及进阶版的网络法。网络分析法做一张术语卡片。（2021-02-09）』——已完成

网络方法试图补充这两种策略。若我们只关注个体元素的行为，许多现象就无法得到解释。例如，生态系统内物种的数量动态并不单单依赖于该物种自身的特征，猎物-捕食者相互作用的全局网络也必须考虑在内。另一方面，专注于大类的元素也可能没什么用。比如，一国发生的政治现象基本上不是由先前存在的国家认同引起的，而是该国内部社会关系的具体模式运作的结果。网络方法则介于通过单个元素和通过大群组进行的描述之间，并将二者连接起来。在某种意义上，网络试图解释一组孤立的元素是如何通过相互作用的模式转化为群体和共同体的。在与这种模式相关的所有情况下，网络方法都提供了重要的洞见。

### 0203. 术语卡 —— 无标度

信息摘自「2021003Networks0501.md => Superconnectors」：

The root of their problems is that body size is a homogeneous magnitude. People entering a cinema are of different sizes, but all the seats are identical: some people find them large, others small, but in general they are reasonably comfortable. Body size does not vary a lot from the average. Very tall (or very short) people are exceptionally rare, and the taller (or shorter) they are, the rarer. Almost everybody knows somebody about 1.90 metres tall, but few know a 2-metre tall person and almost nobody a 2.5-metre one. People are also homogeneous with respect to other features. For example, IQ tests yield results close to the average most of the times, and deviations — both upwards and downwards — are rare. Behaviours can be quite homogeneous, too. For example, drivers can be more or less reckless, but most of the time the speed measured on highways conforms quite closely to the average.

However, homogeneity is not always the rule. For example, the number of friends a person can have is extremely variable. Robert Wadlow was 'only' five times taller than the shortest person ever, Chandra Bahadur Dangi, 55 cm tall, according to the Guinness Book of Records. By contrast, the friendliest people (the hubs of social networks) can have tens or hundreds of friends more than the extremely one, who interact with very few individuals. If contacts in virtual social networks are taken as a proxy of the number of friends a person has, then the hubs of these networks have hundreds more friends than the less connected people. While height is a homogeneous magnitude, the number of social connection is a heterogeneous one.

If the height of people reflected the number of their social connections, somebody as tall as Wadlow would not enter any record book. There would be people hundreds of times taller than the shorter ones: 'social giants’ more than 2 km tall would walk the streets. Even more interestingly, these giants would not be astounding exceptions in a generally short population. All the intermediate heights between dwarf and giant would be represented by some individuals: naturally, the greater the height, the fewer the people of that height; however, the number of tall people in this imaginary world would not diminish as quickly in terms of height as in the real world. In other words, the taller, the rarer: but not as rare as in the real world.

The business of seat manufacturers would be much more difficult in this world, because there would be no way to build a seat that would fit every body size. In the real world, if we want to manufacture seats, or analyse IQ tests, or predict the duration of a road trip, we take into account average height, IQ, or speed. But in order to understand social relations, the very concept of average may be useless. Body size, IQ, road speed, and other magnitudes have a characteristic scale : that is, an average value that in the large majority of cases is a rough predictor of the actual value that one will find. In contrast, social relations do not have this scale. If you knock on the door of an unknown neighbour, you expect to see a person whose height is within a certain reasonable range, and most of the time your guess will be accurate. But it is almost impossible to guess in advance whether that person has many or few friends, and how many. The average number of relationships in a town just gives an idea about whether the social network of that place is more or less dense. But it does not allow us to make any reasonable prediction about each single person. A system with this feature is said to be scale-free or scale-invariant, in the sense that it does not have a characteristic scale. This can be rephrased by saying that the individual fluctuations with respect to the average are too large for us to make a correct prediction.

他们的问题根源在于，身体尺寸是一种「同质」量值。进入电影院的人有着不同的身高，但所有的座椅都一样：有些人觉得椅子大了，其他人觉得小了，但一般而言，他们都觉得还算舒服。身体尺寸不会偏离平均尺寸太多。很高（或很矮）的人非常罕见，越高（或越矮）的人则越少见。几乎每个人都认识 1.9 米高的人，但仅有少数人认识 2 米高的人，而几乎没有人认识身高 2.5 米的人。人们在其他一些特征上也具有同质量值。例如，人们的智商测试结果多数时候接近平均水平，而偏差 一一 无论往上还是向下ー则较为罕见。人们的行为方式也十分同质化。比如，司机可能多少都有些莽撞，但经测量多数时候他们在高速公路上的行驶速度都非常接近平均水平。

然而，同质性并非金科玉律。例如，一个人的朋友数量是极度多变的。根据《吉尼斯世界纪录》，瓦德洛的身高仅是最矮的人的五倍，后者名为钱德拉·巴哈杜尔·唐吉，身高 55 厘米。相比之下，最友好的人（即社交网络中的枢）所交的朋友数比那些仅与很少人交往的极度害羞之人要多出数十上百个。如果将虚拟社交网络中的联系人也算入一个人的朋友之中，那么这些网络的枢纽人物会比那些不善交往的人多出数百个朋友。人们的身高属于「同质」量值，但社交关系的数量却是「异质」的。

1-2『同质对应于正态分布（身高），异质对应于幕律分布（社交数量）。这里的异质引出了「无标度」的概念，即系统不具备特征尺度。无标度做一张术语卡片。（2021-02-16）』——已完成

如果人的身高反映了他们社交关系的数量，那么，像瓦德洛这么高的人不会进入任何世界纪录。社交关系中会有比矮子高出几百倍的人：身高超过两公里的「社交巨人」会行走在社交之路上。更有趣的是，这些巨人在普遍矮小的人群中并不会是惊人的。例外。侏儒和巨人之间的所有中间高度将由另一些人代表：自然，高度越高，人数越少；然而，这个想象世界里的高个子数量不会像在现实世界中那样迅速少。换句话说，越高越少，但也不至于像在现实世界中那般稀有。

在这个想象世界中，座椅制造商的业务难度会增大许多，因为没法制造一个适合每个人身体尺寸的座位。而在现实世界里，如果想制造座椅、分析智商测试或预测自驾旅程的时长，我们会考虑平均身高、智商或行车速度。但为了理解社会关系，平均的概念就显得无用了。身体尺寸、智商、行车速度以及其他量值都具备特征尺度，即大多数情况下的平均值都是对我们所发现的实际值的大致预测。相比之下，社交关系并不具备这种尺度。如果去敲一个陌生邻居的门，你预计看见之人的身高会在一个合理的范围之内，而你的猜测多数时候是准确的。但我们几乎不可能提前猜测此人朋友数量的多寡以及具体数字。某个城镇的平均人际关系数量仅能让我们了解该地区社交网络的密程度。但我们无法据此对每个个人做出任何合理的预测。具备这种特征的系统被认为是无标度或标度不变的，意为该系统并不具备特征尺度。这句话还可以这样表述，相较于平均值，个体波动太大，以至于我们无法做出正确的预测。

### 0204. 术语卡 —— 结构洞

信息摘自「2021003Networks0701.md => Digging Deeper into Networks」：

Cosimo de' Medici, the man who led his family to take over Florence in 15th century, was described as an 'indecipherable sphinx'. Although he rarely spoke publicly, and never committed openly to almost any form of action, he was able to build around him a strong party that made him the pater patriae (father of the nation) of the most important city of the Renaissance. In 1993, social scientists John F. Padgett and Christopher K. Ansell analysed the information about marriages, economic relations, and patronage links that connected the Medici to the other powerful families of the city. They found that Cosimo's family was at the centre of a network of ties with many of the leading lineages. More importantly, without the Medici connection, most of the time those families were weakly related, or even opposed to each other. Cosimo's reserved attitude helped him to establish relations of alliance and control with everyone.

The network with the Medici at the centre is an example of an ego network, a graph composed of a set of nodes with direct ties to a central one (the ego), as well as ties linking them to each other. Whenever one of the latter ties is missing (i.e. two neighbours of the ego are not neighbours to each other) the network has a structural hole. Cosimo's network was full of structural holes, and his family was able to use them to implement a divide et impera (divide and reign) strategy: the Medici were seen as a third party in many conflicts, and families had to ask their mediation in their relations with other families.

However, being surrounded by many structural holes is not always beneficial for an individual. Adolescent girls whose friends are not friends with each oth latter are twice as likely to commit suicide, according to a 2004 study. A possible explanation of this finding is the exposure to conflicting inputs from unrelated friends. Another example comes from workers' unions: when workers' networks lack structural holes (that is, egos are surrounded by nodes with abundant mutual ties), then a powerful, well coordinated, and communicative organization arises. In general, different patterns of structural holes point to different situations. For example, a scientist working in a specialized field is usually connected to other scientists in the field, which are likely connected to each other. On the other hand, a scientist working in a highly interdisciplinary field is probably connected to experts of various areas not necessarily in contact with each other.

In all these cases, it doesn't matter how many friends you have (your degree), or who they are (for example, whether their degree is similar to or different from yours). What really matters is who your friends' friends are; in particular whether or not your friends are also friends to each other. This concept is often referred to as transitivity, or clustering. Let us consider an individual with two friends: they form a connected triple. If the two friends are friends with each other, than in its random counterpart. Isccathen they also form a transitive triple, or triangle. The quantity of triangles in a network compared with the overall number of connected triples is the basic ingredient of the clustering coefficient of that network: this is a measure of the density of triangles in that graph, its overall transitivity. In random networks, the connections between the nearest neighbours of a node are as random as those between any two nodes. As a consequence, these graphs have just the quantity of triangles that emerge from a purely random disposal of edges. On the other hand, the clustering coefficient of almost all real-world networks is higher than their random counterparts. This suggests that some non-trivial process, possibly a form of self-organization, is at work in generating this extra transitivity.

The high clustering of many networks suggests the presence of groups where 'everybody is friends with everybody else'. At first sight, this picture seems to contradict the small-world property of networks: are networks 'open' worlds in which everybody is a few steps from everybody else, or are they the sum of tightly knit, segregated groups? In reality, there is no real contradiction between these two features: one can see this by having a closer look at the Watts–Strogatz model. The model starts by considering a circle of nodes, each of them connected with its first- and second-nearest neighbours, such as remote villages interchanging goods with their neighbours. This is a fully clustered structure, in which all the commercial partners of one village are commercial partners with each other. The model then allows for rewiring a few links to randomly chosen nodes: a few villages open paths to other faraway villages and bring goods there, declining to do business with one of their neighbours. A few paths are enough to reduce abruptly the distance between any two villages, but on the other hand we can think that the local tight commercial structure is disrupted, that is, its clustering goes down. However, Watts and Strogatz found that the decrease in the clustering is less pronounced than the decrease in the average distance. In practice, in order to make a noticeable drop in the transitivity, one has to rewire almost all the nodes. At this point, only random connections are present in the network. Since it is a random graph, we do not expect a large clustering. The take-home message is that networks (neither ordered lattices nor random graphs), can have both large clustering and small average distance at the same time.

Another interesting point about clustering is that in almost all networks, the clustering of a node depends on the degree of that node. Often, the larger the degree, the smaller the clustering coefficient. Small-degree nodes tend to belong to well-interconnected local communities. Similarly, hubs connect with many nodes that are not directly interconnected. In the Internet, for example, low-degree autonomous systems usually belong to highly clustered regional networks, interconnected by national backbones. A similar structure is likely to be present in many networks, where clustering decreases with increasing degree.

科西莫·德·美第奇于 15 世纪带领家族接管佛罗伦萨，人们称他为「难以理解的斯芬克斯」。尽管他绝少公开发表言论，并且也从未公开采取任何形式的行动，但他依旧能够在自己周围建立起强大的党羽，并让自己成为文艺复兴时期最重要城市的国父（pater patriae）。1993 年，社会学家约翰·F.帕吉特和克里斯托弗·K.安赛尔分析了美第奇家族与佛罗伦萨其他权势家族之间的婚姻关系、经济联系和赞助往来。他们发现，科西莫的家族位于众多权贵家族关系网络的中心。更重要者，若无美第奇家族搭线，其他家族多数时候的联系并不多，甚至彼此抵牾。科西莫的克制态度帮助自己建立起了与各家族的联盟和共治关系。

以美第奇家族为中心的网络便是自我中心网络的一个实例，在这种网络中，一组节点与中心节点（自我节点）直接连接，这组节点彼此之间也相互连接。每当后一种连接丢失ー个（也就是自我节点的两个邻点彼此不再相邻），该网络就会出现结构洞。科西莫的网络布满了结构洞，其家族能够用它们实行分而治之（divide et impera）策略：美第奇家族被视为许多冲突的第三方，那些家族不得不要求美第奇家族调节他们彼此的关系。

然而，对个人而言，周围布满许多结构洞并不总是件好事。根据 2004 年的一项研究，朋友之间不构成朋友关系的青春期女孩，其自杀概率为相反情况的两倍。这个发现的可能解释是，当事人会暴露在无关朋友的冲突之中。另外一个例子来自工会：若工人之间的联系网不存在结构洞（即自我节点被大量相互关联的节点包围时），则会形成一个强大、协调良好、交往密切的组织。一般而言，结构洞的不同模式表示不同的情况。例如，专业领域的科学家常常与该领域其他科学家相互联系，后者可能彼此也有联系。另一方面，高度跨学科领域的科学家则很可能与不同领域的科学家都有联系，后者并不必然彼此关联。

在所有这些情况下，你有多少朋友（即你的节点度数），或者他们是谁（比如他们的节点度数与你的相似还是不同）都不重要。重要之事在于，你朋友的朋友是谁：特别是，你的朋友彼此之间是否也是朋友关系。这个概念通常被称为传递性或集聚性。让我们考虑有着两位朋友的一个人：他们三人构成了连接三元组。如果此人的两位朋友彼此也是朋友，那么他们三人同样构成了可传递三元组，或者三角形。网络中的三角形数量与其中的连接三元组总数的比值便是该网络集聚系数的基本组成：这个系数衡量了该图中的三角形密度及其总体的传递性。而在随机网络中，某节点最近点之间的连接与任意其他两个节点间的连接具有同样的随机性。因此，这些图仅有纯粹随机连接的边所组成的三角形。另ー方面，几乎所有现实世界网络的集聚系数都高于其相应的随机网络。这意味着某种重要的过程 —— 可能是某种形式的自组织 —— 在产生这种额外的传递性过程中起到了作用。

许多网络的高度集聚性表明存在着其中「每人都是其他每个人的朋友」这样的群体。乍一看，这幅图景似乎与网络的小世界属性相矛盾：网络是否是个「开放」世界，其中每个人之间都仅隔几步之遥？或者说网络就是紧密编织的分离群体的总和？现实中，这两个特性之间并不存在真正的矛盾：通过仔细观察沃茨-斯托加茨模型就能看出这一点。这个模型以一圈节点为开端，每个节点都与其最近和次近的邻点相连，就像遥远的村庄与其邻村交换货物一样。这是个完全集聚的结构，其中，任一村庄的所有商业伙伴也互为商业伙伴。然后，该模型为随机选择的节点开放一些连接：少数村庄开放了前往其他遥远村庄的路径，并将货物带往该处，且拒绝与其邻居做生意。少量路径便足以陡然降低任意两个村庄之间的距离，但另一方面，我们可以认为当地紧密的商业结构已遭到破坏，也即，当地的集聚性下降了。然而，沃茨和斯托加茨发现，集聚性的降低并不像平均距离的减少那般明显。实际上，为了使传递性显著下降，人们必须重连几乎所有节点。此时，网络中仅剩随机连接了，而我们并不会期待随机图中存在高集聚性。此处的关键信息在于，网络（既不是有序网格，也非随机图）可以同时具备高集聚性和较短的平均节点距离这两个特征。

集聚性的另一个有趣之处在于，几乎所有网络中某节点的集聚性都取决于该节点的度数。通常，节点度数越大，集聚系数便越小。低度数节点往往属于彼此连接良好的局部网络。类似地，枢纽节点与众多节点连接，这些节点并不会直接地彼此连接。例如，互联网中低度数的自治网络常常属于高度集聚的区域网络，且经由全国主干网彼此连接。许多网络中都可能出现类似的结构，其中集聚性会随着节点度数的增加而呈下降趋势。

### 0205. 术语卡 —— 模体

信息摘自「2021003Networks0701.md => Digging Deeper into Networks」：

The simpler form of module is the motif, a pattern of connections within a few nodes repeated throughout the network. In foodwebs we frequently find a diamond-like structure: for example, a carnivore eats two different herbivores, and they both eat the same plant. Another common motif is a simple chain of three species: a big fish eats a small fish that eats an even smaller one. These patterns are not the result of pure chance: motifs appear with a much higher frequency in a real foodweb than in its random counterpart. In general, in large networks, one can isolate many subsets of nodes and edges that may be candidate motifs. However, a given subgraph is considered a relevant motif only if it occurs in a network with a higher probability than in its random counterpart. In the Web, a very common example is the bipartite clique : this is composed of two groups of websites, where all those in the first group have links to all those in the second. Often, this motif identifies a group of 'fans' with the same interests (say, blogs on rafting), pointing to their 'idols' (say, websites of rafting magazines). Networks that regulate genes are almost completely built out of motifs. When the bacterium E. coli is in a stressful condition, a specific genetic circuit senses the stress and coordinates the production of certain proteins. These proteins coalesce to build flagella, a kind of moving tail that allows the bacterium to swim away in search of better conditions. This same genetic circuit, the coherent feed-forward loop, is present in many other bacteria and several other organisms. Evolution seems to have selected specific motifs, because of their optimal properties, (e.g. because they use the smaller number of genes necessary to perform a certain function). Moreover, a clear advantage of modularity is that motifs can combine to give rise to new functions, and damage to one of them is not propagated to the others.

Motifs are a kind of small-scale, local, repeated modules. But when people think about communities, they usually aim at finding great partitions of a network, such as compartments of a foodweb, online communities, disciplinary areas, etc. These structures do not show a regular, repetitive pattern. The task of finding them is easier if we have some clue, for example if the members of the community are self-identified by some element. This might be a widget all the members of the community add to their blogs, a common way of dressing, etc. However, most of the time this information is neither available nor explicit, and we have to dig into the network structure to find the modules. The general objective of community identification is to find sets of nodes that are more highly interconnected:

topology of the network, is based on computing the edge betweenness. That is, finding the edges through which most of the shortest paths pass. The links with highest edge betweenness are akin to the weak links connecting otherwise separated groups in Granovetter's work. If one cuts a few edges with high betweenness, then the network splits into a certain number of isolated clusters: these are suitable candidate communities. One can continue cutting the higher-betweenness edges to find more detailed structures nested within the larger ones.

An interesting application of community finding is the analysis of the US political blogosphere. Physicist Lada Adamic found a clear separation between Democrats' and Republicans' blogs. The resulting structure showed two large groups with very few connections to each other. Moreover, the structure related to liberals' blogs was found to be less cohesive than the conservatives' one. For instance, in the part of this blogosphere dedicated to abortion, pro-life blogs show a denser interconnection than pro-choice blogs. As a result, an online campaign is likely to spread more easily in the first group than in the second. Another study analysed communities of students in US schools, to see whether ethnicity shaped social networks.

仅仅基于网络结构本身，扎卡里的方法便能够几乎完美地预测俱乐部的分裂。从那时起，研究人员便一直致力于找出能够识别网络中的「社区」或「模块」的通用办法。在扎卡里的例子中，这些社区或模块仅通过查看图形便能看出，但在其他复杂得多 89 的情况中，人们尚未发现通用的解方案。所有真实界的网络都在一定程度上显示出模块化特征。很明显，阿拉斯加机场便是机场网络结构中一个特定的模块，其他内部连接良好却与外部没有连接的区域也是如此。食物网也分为若干不同的分部，即那些内部互动更加频繁而与其他物种联系较少的物种群体。社交网络也分为不同的团体：例如，针对青少年的研究表明，他们的行为强烈地受其所属群体的影响。神经网络常被划分为对应特定功能的大区块。基因调控网络则被分为不同的子网络，后者与特定的功能或疾病相关联。度数、相关性、集聚性以及中心性都提供了单个节点及其紧邻的周环境和节点在整个网络中的相对地位等信息，但它们并不体现整个图形所分解成的各别结构。

模块的更简单形式是模体，它是少数节点在整个网络中重复出现的连接模式。在食物网中，我们经常会发现某种菱形结构：例如，某种食肉动物捕食两种不同的食草动物，后两者食用同一种植物。另一种常见的模体是三个物种的简单链条：大鱼吃小鱼，小鱼吃虾米。这些模式并非纯粹概率的结果：模体在真实的食物网中出现的频率比在其随机对照网络中高出很多。通常，在大型网络中，人们可以区隔出许多可能为候选模体的由节点和边组成的子集。然而，只有当给定的子图出现在某网络中的频率高于其随机对照图时，该子图才能被认为是相关模体。在万维网中，一个十分常见的例子是「二分团」：它由两组网站组成，其中一组的所有网站与另一组所有网站之间相互连接。通常，这种模体能够确定一组有着相同兴趣的「粉丝」群体（比如有关漂流的博客），并指向他们的「偶像」（例如漂流杂志的网站等）。调控基因的网络则几乎完全由模体构建。当大肠杆菌处于应激状态时，特定的基因回路会感知到应激状态，并协调某些蛋白质的产生。这些蛋白质联合起来形成鞭毛，这种不断摆动的尾状物能让细菌游走以寻找更好的环境。相同的遗传回路，即协调前馈环还存在于许多其他细菌和一些其他微生物体内。演化似乎已经因为特定模体的最优特性而选择了它们（例如，因为它们能用更少量的所需基因来执行某项功能）。此外，模体机制的明显优点是模体可以组合产生新的功能，而其中某个模体受到破坏也不会影响到别的模体。

1-2『模体少数节点在整个网络中重复出现的连接模式，直觉上「模体」会在以后开发的「智慧工厂」模型里起到关键作用。做一张术语卡片先。（2021-02-17）』——已完成

模体乃某种小规模、局部的重复性模块。但当人们考虑社区时，他们通常意在发现网络中的大型分区，比如食物网的区划、在线社区、学科领域等等。这些结构并不表现出规律性的重复模式。如果我们掌握了某些线索，比如，假如社区的成员因某个因素而自发确定自己的身份，则相对容易找到它们。这个因素可能是社区内所有成员添加到他们博客上的小饰物、共同的着装方式等。然而，多数时候这种信息既非现成也不明确，我们必须深入挖掘网络结构以找到模块。社区识别的总体目标为发现那些内部连接比彼此之间连接更为紧密的节点集，就像空手道俱乐部网络中呈现的那样。口头表述是很容易的，但将此概念转换为数学表达却很难，以至于人们尚未发现确切的社群检测方法。一些方法可以聚合节点以满足最优性准则。其他方法则可将网络拆分为群组，然后再进一步将群组进行拆分，接着再进行拆分，进而创建一个嵌套社区的谱系树。还有一些方法在节点之间放置假想的弹簧，然后查看系统松弛之后所形成的节点群集。一般来说，还有很多其他方法上的选项。有一种有趣的技术聪明地利用了网络拓扑学，其基础在于计算边介数，也就是找出多数最短路径所通过的边。具有最高边介数的连接类似于在格兰诺维特的研究中连接原本相互分离之群体的弱连。如果去掉一些高介数的边，那么，网络就会分裂成一定数量的孤立节点群集：它们便是恰当的候选社区。我们还可以继续去掉网络中一些介数较高的边，以找出嵌套在更大结构中的更为精细的结构。

社区发现方法的一个有趣应用是对美国政治博客圈的分析。物理学家拉达·阿达米克在民主党人和共和党人的博客间发现了清晰的分隔。其得出的网络结构显示，这两大党的阵营绝少相互关联。此外，民主党的博客比共和党的博客更缺乏凝聚力。例如，在此博客圈的堕胎讨论专区中，反对堕胎的博客比支持堕胎的博客联系更为紧密。因此，在线造势运动更可能在前者的博客中得到传播。另一项研究分析了美国学校中的学生社区特征，借此了解种族是否会塑造社交网络。在种族非常多元和十分同质的学校中，这一因素似乎都是无关紧要的。相反，在种族多样性处于中间值时则能看出隔离特征。在代谢网络中，人们已经发现了与特定功能相对应的社区（碳水化合物代谢，核苷酸与核酸代谢，蛋白质、肽和氨基酸代谢，脂类代谢，芳香族化合物代谢，单碳化合物代谢和辅酶代谢等）。最后，公司股票则在价格相关性的基础上聚类，人们能从中发现与银行、矿业、分销、金融等各业务领域相对应的模块。

将社区定义为「内部联系比外部联系更为紧密」的子图非常普遍，但这种做法并未涵盖某些特定的模块。想想朋友间的电话通信链条，其中第一个呼叫第二个，第二个呼叫第三个，以此类推：根据上述定义，这种链条极有可能不会被归类为社区。另外一个例子则是同行业竟争者的网页：显然，他们并没有动力相互连接，尽管他们明显属于同一社区。此外，真实世界的社区比密集的节点群集复杂得多。多种划分可能同时出现；国籍、社会阶层、性别、工作、政治观念統都可用来对同一群人进行分类。而且，社区之间可能互相重：ー个人可能同时从属于多个国籍或隶属关系。最后，嵌套社区也可能存在：例如，地域身份从属于国籍。

尽管过于简化，但图示法仍然能够捕捉到系统的诸多相关特征。若我们仔细查看图，便会发现大量相关信息，而运行的复杂测算越多，便会呈现越多细节。真实世界的网络几乎在任何时候都会偏离其随机对照网络，这意味着其中存在某种嵌入的秩序。同样，所有这些网络都未经过设计：偏离很可能产生于自组织过程。目前，在图的结构中寻找新的规律并揭示其潜在机制是网络科学仍然面临的一些挑战。

### 0501. 数据信息卡 —— 哥尼斯堡七桥之谜的洞见

问题：在不重复走过一座桥的前提下，能否遍历所有七座桥（欧拉桥）。

洞见：除了起点和终点允许有奇数座桥，里面的「节点」必须是有偶数座桥（边）才到实现上面的要求。

印象：记得这个问题是数学中图论的起源。

A riddle was popular in the town: was it possible to walk across the seven bridges, without crossing any of them twice? Nobody had ever been able to do this successfully. On the other hand, no formal proof was available about the feasibility of such a walk. The solution came from one of the most famous mathematicians of all times. In 1736, Leonard Euler drew a map of Königsberg in an unusual fashion. He represented the portions of mainland and the island as dots, and the bridges as lines, connecting the dots with each other (Figure 2 bottom).

When we cast the problem in this form, things become easier. By showing the network out of the city, Euler proved that the walk was impossible. His explanation is based on the following observation: for such a walk to be feasible, all the dots along the path must have an even number of connections. This is because every time one enters any part of the city via a bridge, one must leave via a different bridge. In general, each area must have an even number of bridges, e.g. 2, 4, 6. Only the start points and end points of the walk can have an odd number of links: at the start point, there can be only one bridge; and the same holds for the end point. Unfortunately, the graph of Königsberg has all the vertices with an odd number of links. Therefore it is impossible to walk only once over all the bridges.

2『哥尼斯堡七桥之谜的洞见，做一张信息数据卡片。（2021-02-09）』

当时的城里流行着一个谜题：是否可能在不重复走过一座桥的情況下，遍历所有七座桥？之前没有任何人成功做到这一点。另一方面，对这种走法的可行性，当时也不存在任何形式证明。而其解决方案来自古往今来最著名的数学家之一。1736 年，菜昂哈德·欧拉以一种不寻常的方式画出了哥尼斯堡市的地图。他将陆地和岛屿的部分表示为点，而桥则为连接各点的线（图 2 下）。

当我们以这种方式看待该问题，事情就变得更加容易了。通过展示城市的网络结构，欧拉证明了谜题中的走法不可能。他的解释基于以下观察：若此种走法可行，则路程沿线所有点的连接数必为偶数。这是因为每当某人通过一座桥进入该市的任何部分时，他必须通过另外一座不同的桥离开。总之每个区域必须有偶数座桥，比如 2 座、4 座、6 座等等。只有起点和终点可以有奇数个连接数：起点只能有一座桥，终点亦复如此。不幸的是，哥尼斯堡地图所有顶点的连接数均为奇数。因此，人们不可能一次性谝历所有桥而不重复。

## 序言

著名诗人北岛有一首名为《生活》的一字诗：网。

毫无疑问，我们的世界运行在有形或无形的网络之中，尤其是在信息技术飞速发展的今天。进入 21 世纪以来，技术进步和社会经济的全球化，把世界更加紧密地联结在一起，系統性和复杂性已经成为各领域核心问题的共性特征。

正像《网络》一书中指出的，系统性和复杂性的现象在我们的生活中比比皆是，大到全球性的金融危机、生态系统的稳定性，小到空手道俱乐部的分裂和足球队的场上表现，其突出表现是系统各单元或要素，通过相互关联和影响所展现出的涌现性行为：在没有中心控制和全局信息的情况下，仅仅通过个体之间的局域相互作用，系统就可以在一定条件下展现出宏观的时空或功能结构，在新的层次上涌现出具有整体性的性质和功能。在这里应该强调的是，非线性的关联和相互作用关系对于系统的涌现性至关重要，它使得系统的整体行为不能通过个体行为的简单加而获得。因此，结构决定系统功能，刻画系统中的相互作用关系对于认识和理解系统的宏观性质意义重大。

而复杂网络就是对系统结构的最一般和本质的刻画。系统中的个体对应于网络的节点，个体之间的联系或相互作用对应于联结节点的边。网络的抽象，超越了每个系统自身的特殊性质、独特背景和演化机制，让我们可以用統一、普适的网络分析方法去研究系统的性质，进而加深对系统共性的了解事实上，自 18 世纪欧拉建立起图与网络的概念，解決了哥尼斯堡七桥问题开始，图与网络就成为刻画结构的重要工具，并于 19 世纪中叶进入社会学领域，社会网络分析由此成为社会计量学的重要工具。

1998 年，沃茨-斯托加茨提出小世界网络模型，指出少量的随机捷径会改变网络的拓扑结构，从而涌现出小世界的效应；随后，巴拉巴西提出了无标度网络概念，解释了增长和择优机制在复杂网络自组织演化过程中的普遍性和幂律的重要性。这些开创性的研究工作使我们认识到，实际系统的网络结构存在着许多超越经典随机网络的特殊性质，例如小世界性质、幂律度分布、不同的匹配关系、社团结构等，我们需要建立更加细致、准确的概念，刻画网络结构并进而更加科学地认识系统性质，以促进网络科学的快速发展。

网络描述方法已被广泛应用于实际系统的研究，例如神经元网络、食物链网络、因特网络、赛博空间以及人与人之间交往的社会网络等等，研究结果加深了对这些具体系统的理解，且提出了一系列新的概念和分析方法。总体上说，网络科学研究包括以下主要内容：

1、如何定量刻画复杂网络？通过实证分析，了解实际网络结构的特点，并建立相应概念以刻画网络结构特征。

2、网络是如何发展成现在这种结构的？建立网络演化模型，理解网络结构的产生和涌现。

3、网络特定结构的后果是什么？利用基于网络的特定动力学过程，如新陈代谢网络上的物质流、食物链网络上的能量流、万维网上的信息传播、社会网络上的论形成等等，探讨网络结构与功能的关系。

4、利用网络结构的设计和调整，控制和优化系统功能。

总的来说，复杂系统的涌现现象是具有整体性和全局性的行为，不能通过分析还原的方法去研究，必须考虑个体之间的关联和相互作用。从这个意义上讲，理解复杂系统的行为应该从理解系统相互作用的网络结构开始。2009 年，《科学》杂志以「复杂系统与网络」（Complex Systems and Netwo ks）为主题，发表一集专刊，其中巴拉巴西教授的一段话很有启发意义。

他指出，由于底层结构对于系統行为有着重大的影响，除非探讨网络结构，否则没有办法去理解复杂系統。希望《网络》一书能够帯领大家进入生动有趣的网络科学领域。
