### 1.1 Electrical forcesConsider

a force like gravitation which varies predominantly inversely as the square of the distance, but which is about a billion-billion-billion-billion times stronger. And with another diﬀerence. There are two kinds of「matter,」which we can call positive and negative. Like kinds repel and unlike kinds attract — unlike gravity where there is only attraction. What would happen?

A bunch of positives would repel with an enormous force and spread out in all directions. A bunch of negatives would do the same. But an evenly mixed bunch of positives and negatives would do something completely diﬀerent. The opposite pieces would be pulled together by the enormous attractions. The net result would be that the terriﬁc forces would balance themselves out almost perfectly, by forming tight, ﬁne mixtures of the positive and the negative, and between two separate bunches of such mixtures there would be practically no attraction or repulsion at all.

There is such a force: the electrical force. And all matter is a mixture of positive protons and negative electrons which are attracting and repelling with this great force. So perfect is the balance, however, that when you stand near someone else you don’t feel any force at all. If there were even a little bit of unbalance you would know it. If you were standing at arm’s length from someone and each of you had one percent more electrons than protons, the repelling force would be incredible. How great? Enough to lift the Empire State Building? No! To lift Mount Everest? No! The repulsion would be enough to lift a「weight」equal to that of the entire earth!

With such enormous forces so perfectly balanced in this intimate mixture, it is not hard to understand that matter, trying to keep its positive and negative charges in the ﬁnest balance, can have a great stiﬀness and strength. The EmpireState Building, for example, swings less than one inch in the wind because the electrical forces hold every electron and proton more or less in its proper place. On the other hand, if we look at matter on a scale small enough that we see only a few atoms, any small piece will not, usually, have an equal number of positive and negative charges, and so there will be strong residual electrical forces. Even when there are equal numbers of both charges in two neighboring small pieces, there may still be large net electrical forces because the forces between individual charges vary inversely as the square of the distance. A net force can arise if anegative charge of one piece is closer to the positive than to the negative charges of the other piece. The attractive forces can then be larger than the repulsive ones and there can be a net attraction between two small pieces with no excess charges. The force that holds the atoms together, and the chemical forces that hold molecules together, are really electrical forces acting in regions where the balance of charge is not perfect, or where the distances are very small.

You know, of course, that atoms are made with positive protons in the nucleus and with electrons outside. You may ask:「If this electrical force is so terriﬁc, why don’t the protons and electrons just get on top of each other? If they want to be in an intimate mixture, why isn’t it still more intimate?」The answer has to do with the quantum eﬀects. If we try to conﬁne our electrons in a region that is very close to the protons, then according to the uncertainty principle they musthave some mean square momentum which is larger the more we try to conﬁne them. It is this motion, required by the laws of quantum mechanics, that keeps the electrical attraction from bringing the charges any closer together.

There is another question:「What holds the nucleus together」? In a nucleus there are several protons, all of which are positive. Why don’t they push them-selves apart? It turns out that in nuclei there are, in addition to electrical forces, nonelectrical forces, called nuclear forces, which are greater than the electrical forces and which are able to hold the protons together in spite of the electrical repulsion. The nuclear forces, however, have a short range — their force falls oﬀ much more rapidly than 1/r2. And this has an important consequence. If anucleus has too many protons in it, it gets too big, and it will not stay together. An example is uranium, with 92 protons. The nuclear forces act mainly between each proton (or neutron) and its nearest neighbor, while the electrical forces actover larger distances, giving a repulsion between each proton and all of the others in the nucleus. The more protons in a nucleus, the stronger is the electrical repulsion, until, as in the case of uranium, the balance is so delicate that the nucleus is almost ready to ﬂy apart from the repulsive electrical force. If such anucleus is just「tapped」lightly (as can be done by sending in a slow neutron), it breaks into two pieces, each with positive charge, and these pieces ﬂy apart by electrical repulsion. The energy which is liberated is the energy of the atomic bomb. This energy is usually called「nuclear」energy, but it is really「electrical」energy released when electrical forces have overcome the attractive nuclear forces. We may ask, ﬁnally, what holds a negatively charged electron together (sinceit has no nuclear forces). If an electron is all made of one kind of substance, each part should repel the other parts. Why, then, doesn’t it ﬂy apart? But does the electron have「parts」? Perhaps we should say that the electron is just a pointand that electrical forces only act between diﬀerent point charges, so that the electron does not act upon itself. Perhaps. All we can say is that the question of what holds the electron together has produced many diﬃculties in the attempts to form a complete theory of electromagnetism. The question has never been answered. We will entertain ourselves by discussing this subject some more inlater chapters.

As we have seen, we should expect that it is a combination of electrical forces and quantum-mechanical eﬀects that will determine the detailed structure of materials in bulk, and, therefore, their properties. Some materials are hard, some are soft. Some are electrical「conductors」— because their electrons are free to move about; others are「insulators」— because their electrons are held tightly to individual atoms. We shall consider later how some of these properties come about, but that is a very complicated subject, so we will begin by looking at the electrical forces only in simple situations. We begin by treating only the laws of electricity — including magnetism, which is really a part of the same subject.

We have said that the electrical force, like a gravitational force, decreases inversely as the square of the distance between charges. This relationship is called Coulomb’s law. But it is not precisely true when charges are moving — the electrical forces depend also on the motions of the charges in a complicated way. One part of the force between moving charges we call the magnetic force. It is really one aspect of an electrical eﬀect. That is why we call the subject「electromagnetism.」

There is an important general principle that makes it possible to treat electromagnetic forces in a relatively simple way. We ﬁnd, from experiment, that the force that acts on a particular charge — no matter how many other charges there are or how they are moving — depends only on the position of that particular charge, on the velocity of the charge, and on the amount of charge. We can write the force F on a charge q moving with a velocity v as:

```
F = q(E + v × B)    (1.1)
```

We call E the electric ﬁeld and B the magnetic ﬁeld at the location of the charge. The important thing is that the electrical forces from all the other charges in the universe can be summarized by giving just these two vectors. Their values will depend on where the charge is, and may change with time. Furthermore, if we replace that charge with another charge, the force on the new charge will be just in proportion to the amount of charge so long as all the rest of the charges in the world do not change their positions or motions. (In real situations, of course, each charge produces forces on all other charges in the neighborhood and may cause these other charges to move, and so in some cases the ﬁelds can change if we replace our particular charge by another.) We know from Vol. I how to ﬁnd the motion of a particle if we know the force on it. Equation (1.1) can be combined with the equation of motion to give:

(1.2)

So if E and B are given, we can ﬁnd the motions. Now we need to know how the E’s and B’s are produced. One of the most important simplifying principles about the way the ﬁelds are produced is this: Suppose a number of charges moving in some manner would produce a ﬁeld E1, and another set of charges would produce E2. If both sets of charges are in place at the same time (keeping the same locations and motionsthey had when considered separately), then the ﬁeld produced is just the sum:

```
E = E1 + E2     (1.3)
```

This fact is called the principle of superposition of ﬁelds. It holds also for magneticﬁelds.

This principle means that if we know the law for the electric and magnetic ﬁelds produced by a single charge moving in an arbitrary way, then all the laws of electrodynamics are complete. If we want to know the force on charge A we need only calculate the E and B produced by each of the charges B, C, D, etc., and then add the E’s and B’s from all the charges to ﬁnd the ﬁelds, and from them the forces acting on charge A. If it had only turned out that the ﬁeld producedby a single charge was simple, this would be the neatest way to describe the laws of electrodynamics. We have already given a description of this law (Chapter 28,Vol. I) and it is, unfortunately, rather complicated.

It turns out that the form in which the laws of electrodynamics are simplest are not what you might expect. It is not simplest to give a formula for the forcethat one charge produces on another. It is true that when charges are standing still the Coulomb force law is simple, but when charges are moving about the relations are complicated by delays in time and by the eﬀects of acceleration, among others. As a result, we do not wish to present electrodynamics only through the force laws between charges; we ﬁnd it more convenient to consider another point of view — a point of view in which the laws of electrodynamics appear to be the most easily manageable.

1-1 电力

现在来考虑一种力，它也像引力那样与距离平方成反比地变化，但比引力要强约一万亿亿亿倍。另外，还有一个区别，即存在两种我们可称之为正的和负的「物质」，种类相同的相斥，不同的相吸。这就不像引力，那里只存在吸引。这样，会出现什么情景呢？

一堆正的物质会以巨力互相排斥，并向四面八方散开，一堆负的物质亦是如此。但一堆正、负物质的均匀混合物就完全不同了。相反的物质会以巨大的吸引力互相拉挽着，净结果将把那些可怕的斥力差不多完全抵消了，这是通过形成紧密而精致的正、负物质的混合体而达到的，而这样两堆分开着的混合体之间实际上就不再存在任何引力或斥力了。

确实存在这样一种力 ー一 电力。世间万物都是由此种巨力互相吸引和排斥着的正的质子与负的电子所组成的混合物。然而，平衡竟是那么完善，以致当你站在别人旁边时也根本没有任何受力的感觉。这时，即使只有一点点不平衡，你都会觉察到。例如，要是你站在别人旁边相距只有一臂之遥，而且各自都具有比本身的质子仅多出百分之一的电子，那两人间的排斥力就会大得不得了！多大呢？足以举起那座帝国大厦`*`？不！举起珠穆朗玛峰？不！这个斥力应足以举起相当于整个地球的「重量」！

由于在这种致密混合物中这些巨力完善地达到了平衡，所以我们就不难理解：当物质试图保持其正、负电荷最细致的平衡时，它能具有多大的硬度与强度。例如，帝国大厦在风中之所以摇摆小于一英寸，是因为电力把每一个电子与质子或多或少地保持在其适当位置上。另一方面，如果我们在一个足够小的尺度范围内观察物质，使得只能看到几个原子，那么任一小部分就往往不会有相等数目的正电荷和负电荷，从而会存在强大的剩余电力。即使在相邻两小部分中两种电荷的数目相等，也仍然有可能拥有巨大的净电力，因为各电荷之间的力是与距离的平方成反比的。如果一部分中的负电荷，与另一部分中的正电荷靠得较近、而与负电荷离得较远，则力就会产生。因此，吸引力可能大于排斥力，从而在两个不带额外电荷的小块中就有一个净吸引力存在。那种把各原子结合在一起的力，以及把各分子保持在一起的化学力，其实都是电力，它们在电荷的平衡不够完善、或在距离十分微小的那些区域里才起作用。

当然，你会知道，原子是由位于其核内的正的质子和核外的负电子所构成的。你也许会问：「如果这种电力那么厉害，为什么质子和电子不会正好一个紧挨着一个呢？如果它们想要形成一个紧密的混合体，为什么不会更紧密些呢？」这问题必须用量子效应来回答。要是试图把电子限制在一个很接近于质子的区域中，那么按照不确定性原理它们就得拥有一个均方动量，若我们把它们限制得越紧，这个均方动量就越大。正是这一种由量子力学规律所支配的运动，才使得电的吸引力不会把这两个电荷移得更接近些。

还有一个问题。在原子核内有若干个质子，它们全都带着正电荷，为什么它们不会互相推开呢？「是什么东西把它们结合在一起的呢？」事实是，在原子核内部，除了电力之外还存在一种称为核力的非电力，它比电力还要大，因而尽管有电的排斥力，它仍然能够把那些质子维持在一起。然而，核力是短程力 ー一 该力下降得比 1/r^2 急剧得多。这就产生了一个重要后果：如果一个核所含质子过多，则该核就变得太大，它便不会持久维持。铀就是这么个例子，它含有 92 个质子。核力主要在每个质子（或中子）与其最近邻质子（或中子）之间起作用，而电力则在较大的距离范围内起作用，使每个质子与核内所有其他质子之间都具有排斥力。在一个核内质子的数目越多，这电的排斥作用就越强，直到铀那种情况，平衡是那么脆弱，以致于排斥性电力使得核几乎就要飞散了。这么ー个核，如果稍微「轻轻敲」一下（就像曾经送进一个慢中子那样），则它就会破裂成各带有正电荷的两片，而这些裂片由于电的排斥力而飞散开去。释放出来的能量就是原子弹的能量。这种能量通常称为「核」能，但实际上却是当电力克服了吸引性核力时所释放出来的「电」能。

最后，我们还可能会问，是什么东西把带负电的电子保持在一起呢（因为它没有核力）？如果电子全都是由一种物质构成的，那它的每一部分理应排斥其他各部分，但又为什么不会飞散呢？不过，电子是否还含有「各部分」？也许，我们应该说电子只是一个点，而电力只是在不同的点电荷之间起作用，以致电子不会作用于其本身。或许是这样吧。关于电子由什么东西束缚在一起，我们只能说到这里。这个问题对于试图建立一套完整的电磁学理论产生了不少困难，而且至今没有做出解答。我们将在以后某些章节中对这一课题多做些讨论，以为我们大家助兴。

正如我们已经见到的那样，应该指望电力与量子力学效应相结合来确定整块材料的细致结构，从而确定它们的特性。有的材料硬，有的材料软。有的是电的「导体」一一 因为它们中的电子能够自由运动；其他则是「绝缘体」—— 因为其中的电子被牢固地缚在各个原子内。这些性质是如何得来的？那是一个十分复杂的课题，我们将在以后加以讨论。因而现在仅就一些简单情况下的电力进行考察，也就是说，现在着手处理电方面 一一 也包括磁方面（那实际上是同一课题的另ー个部分）—— 的规律。

我们曾经说过，和引力相似，电力与电荷间距离的平方成反比地减弱，这一关系叫作库仑定律。但当电荷运动时，这一定律就不完全准确 一一 电力也以一种复杂的方式依赖于电荷的运动。运动电荷之间的作用力，有一部分我们称之为磁力，事实上，它是电效应的一个方面。这也是为什么要把这一课题叫作「电磁学」的缘故。

由于存在着一个重要的普遍原理，因而有可能以相对简单的方式来处理电磁力。我们从实验发现，作用于某一特定电荷上的力 ー一 不管其他电荷的数量和运动方式如何 一一 只取决于该特定电荷的位置、速度以及所带的电荷量。我们可把作用于一个以速度 ν 运动的电荷上的力 F 写成：`F = q(E + v × B)`。

式中 E 和 B 分别叫做电荷所在处的电场和磁场。重要的是，来自宇宙中所有其他电荷的力都可用刚才给出的这两个矢量叠加而成。它们的值将取决于这一电荷位于何处，并且可能随时间而改变。此外，如果我们用另一个电荷来代替该电荷，只要世界上所有其他电荷都不改变其位置和运动，则作用于这一新电荷上的力恰好与其电荷量成正比。当然，在实际情况中，每一电荷对邻近的所有其他电荷都产生力，从而可能引起这些电荷运动。所以在某些情况下，如果我们用另一个电荷来代替该特定电荷，则场可能改变。

我们从第 1 卷已经懂得，若知道了作用在一个质点上的力，应怎样去求出该质点的运动。可以把式（1.1）和运动方程相结合而得出：

『公式详见原书。』

因此若 E 和 B 已知，则可以求得运动。现在我们需要弄清楚 E 和 B 是怎样产生的。

关于电磁场产生方法最重要的简化原理之一是：假设若干个以某种方式运动的电荷产生一个场 E1，而另一组电荷产生场 E2，而这两组电荷同时被置于原来的位置（保持它们被分别考虑时具有的相同的位置和相同的运动），那么所产生的场恰好是两个场的和，即：`E = E1 + E2`。

这一个事实称为场的叠加原理。这原理也适用于磁场。这一原理意味着，如果知道了关于以任意方式运动的单个电荷所产生的电场和磁场的规律，那么所有电动力学的规律就告齐全了。如果我们想要知道作用于电荷 A 上的力，就只需算出由 B、C、D 等各电荷所产生的 E 和 B，然后把所有电荷产生的 E 和 B 分别相加而求得总场，再从这两个总场求得作用于电荷 A 的力。只要结果证明，由单个电荷产生的场很简单，那么这就是描写电动力学规律的最简洁方法。可惜，我们已给出了这一定律的描述（第 1 卷第 28 章），那是相当复杂的。

事实证明，电动力学规律在其中最为简单的那一种形式，并非是人们可以期望的。要写出一个电荷对另一个电荷所产生的力的公式，并非那么容易。的确，当电荷静止不动时，库仑力的定律是十分简单的。但当电荷运动时，由于时间上的延迟和加速度的影响以及其他些缘故，关系就变得复杂了。因此，我们并不希望仅仅凭作用于各电荷间的力的规律来介绍电动力学；而发现更方便的是去考虑另一个观点 一一 那是电动力学规律表现得最易于处理的一种观点。

### 1-2 Electric and magnetic ﬁelds

First, we must extend, somewhat, our ideas of the electric and magnetic vectors, E and B. We have deﬁned them in terms of the forces that are felt by acharge. We wish now to speak of electric and magnetic ﬁelds at a point even when there is no charge present. We are saying, in eﬀect, that since there are forces「acting on」the charge, there is still「something」there when the charge is removed. If a charge located at the point (x, y, z) at the time t feels the force F given by Eq. (1.1) we associate the vectors E and B with the point in space (x, y, z). We may think of E(x, y, z, t) and B(x, y, z, t) as giving the forces that would be experienced at the time t by a charge located at (x, y, z), with the condition that placing the charge there did not disturb the positions or motions of all the other charges responsible for the ﬁelds.

Following this idea, we associate with every point (x, y, z) in space two vectors E and B, which may be changing with time. The electric and magnetic ﬁelds are, then, viewed as vector functions of x, y, z, and t. Since a vector is speciﬁed by its components, each of the ﬁelds E(x, y, z, t) and B(x, y, z, t) represents three mathematical functions of x, y, z, and t.

It is precisely because E (or B) can be speciﬁed at every point in space that itis called a「ﬁeld.」A「ﬁeld」is any physical quantity which takes on diﬀerent values at diﬀerent points in space. Temperature, for example, is a ﬁeld — in this case ascalar ﬁeld, which we write as T(x, y, z). The temperature could also vary in time, and we would say the temperature ﬁeld is time-dependent, and write T(x, y, z, t). Another example is the「velocity ﬁeld」of a ﬂowing liquid. We write v(x, y, z, t) for the velocity of the liquid at each point in space at the time t. It is a vector ﬁeld.

Returning to the electromagnetic ﬁelds — although they are produced by charges according to complicated formulas, they have the following important characteristic: the relationships between the values of the ﬁelds at one point andthe values at a nearby point are very simple. With only a few such relationships in the form of diﬀerential equations we can describe the ﬁelds completely. It is in terms of such equations that the laws of electrodynamics are most simply written.There have been various inventions to help the mind visualize the behavior ofﬁelds. The most correct is also the most abstract: we simply consider the ﬁeldsas mathematical functions of position and time. We can also attempt to get amental picture of the ﬁeld by drawing vectors at many points in space, each of which gives the ﬁeld strength and direction at that point. Such a representationis shown in Fig. 1-1. We can go further, however, and draw lines which are everywhere tangent to the vectors — which, so to speak, follow the arrows and keep track of the direction of the ﬁeld. When we do this we lose track of the lengths of the vectors, but we can keep track of the strength of the ﬁeld by drawing the lines far apart when the ﬁeld is weak and close together when it is strong. We adopt the convention that the number of lines per unit area at right angles to the lines is proportional to the ﬁeld strength. This is, of course, only an approximation, and it will require, in general, that new lines sometimes start up in order to keep the number up to the strength of the ﬁeld. The ﬁeld of Fig. 1-1 is represented by ﬁeld lines in Fig. 1-2.

Fig. 1-1. A vector ﬁeld may be represented by drawing a set of arrows whose magnitudes and directions indicate the values of the vector ﬁeld at the points from which the arrows are drawn.

Fig. 1-2. A vector ﬁeld can be represented by drawing lines which are tangent to the direction of the ﬁeld vector at each point, and by drawing the density of lines proportional to the magnitude of the ﬁeld vector.

1-2 电场和磁场

首先，我们必须对电和磁矢量即 E 和 B 的概念稍做推广。依据一个电荷所感受到的力，我们已对 E 和 B 下了定义。现在我们想要谈谈即使没有电荷存在的某一点的电场和磁场。实际上，既然有力「作用在」电荷上，则当电荷移去时，那里仍存在「某种东西」。如果位于点 `(x, y, z)` 上的电荷、在时刻 t 感受到由式（1.1）所给出的力 F，则我们便可以把矢量 E 和 B 与空间中该点 `(x, y, z)` 联系起来。可以认为 `E(x, y, z, t)` 和 `B(x, y, z, t)` 给出了力，即可被位于 `(x, y, z)` 点的电荷、在时刻 t 体验到那个力，同时满足这样一个条件：在那里放置该电荷，并不扰动产生这场的所有其他电荷的位置或运动。

根据这一概念，我们把空间中每一点 `(x, y, z)` 与两个矢量 E 和 B 相联系，它们也可能会随时间而改变，于是，电场和磁场就可视作 x, y, x 和 t 的矢量函数。既然一个矢量由其各分量所确定，所以场 E 和 B 就代表了 x, y, x 和 t 的三个数学函数。

正因为 E（或 B）可以在空间每一点被规定下来，所以它才被称为「场」。所谓「场」，就是在空间不同点上会取不同值的一种物理量。例如，温度就是一种场 一一 在这一情况下是一标量场，我们把它写成 `T(x, y, z)`。温度也可能随时间变化，那么我们应称温度场与时间有关，从而把它写成 `T(x, y, z, t)`。另一例为流动液体的「速度场」，我们把时刻 t 空间每一点的液体速度写成 `v(x, y, z, t)`，它是一个矢量场。

回到电磁场方面来，虽然它们是按复杂公式由电荷所产生的，但却具有如下重要特性：在空间一点的场值与一邻近点的场值之间存在十分简单的关系。仅凭几个以微分方程表达的这种关系，我们就能把场完整地描述出来。正是依靠这样的方程式，电动力学规律オ得以被最简洁地写出。

曾有过种种发明，试图帮助人们把场的行为形象化。其中最正确也最抽象的一种是：仅认为场是位置与时间的数学函数。

我们可以尝试通过在空间的许多点各画出一些矢量来获得一个关于场的思维图像，其中每一矢量给出该点场的强度和方向。这表达方式如图 1-1 所示。另外，我们还可以进一步画出处处都与那些矢量相切的一些线，比如，这些线沿着那些箭头并跟踪着场的方向。当我们这样做时，就已丧失了矢量长度的痕迹，但可通过如下办法来记录场的强度即对于弱场把场线画得较疏，而对于强场则把场线画得较密。我们按惯例使通过垂直于线的每单面积的线数与场强成正比。当然，这只是一种近似，一般说来，有时还需要在某处画一些新线以保持线数与场强相配。这样，图 1-1 所示的场就可由图 1-2 所示的场线来表示。

图 1-1 矢量场可用一组箭头来表示。每支箭头的大小和方向为所画箭头的那一点的矢量场之值

图 1-2 矢量场可用一些线来表示，这些线在每一点与场矢量的方向相切，而线的密度则与场矢量的大小成正比

### 1-3 Characteristics of vector ﬁelds

There are two mathematically important properties of a vector ﬁeld whichwe will use in our description of the laws of electricity from the ﬁeld point ofview. Suppose we imagine a closed surface of some kind and ask whether weare losing「something」from the inside; that is, does the ﬁeld have a quality of「outﬂow」? For instance, for a velocity ﬁeld we might ask whether the velocity isalways outward on the surface or, more generally, whether more ﬂuid ﬂows out(per unit time) than comes in. We call the net amount of ﬂuid going out throughthe surface per unit time the「ﬂux of velocity」through the surface. The ﬂowthrough an element of a surface is just equal to the component of the velocityperpendicular to the surface times the area of the surface. For an arbitrary closedsurface, the net outward ﬂow — or ﬂux — is the average outward normal componentof the velocity, times the area of the surface:

```
Flux = average normal component x surface area  (1.4)
```

In the case of an electric ﬁeld, we can mathematically deﬁne somethinganalogous to an outﬂow, and we again call it the ﬂux, but of course it is not theﬂow of any substance, because the electric ﬁeld is not the velocity of anything. Itturns out, however, that the mathematical quantity which is the average normalcomponent of the ﬁeld still has a useful signiﬁcance. We speak, then, of theelectric ﬂux — also deﬁned by Eq. (1.4). Finally, it is also useful to speak of theﬂux not only through a completely closed surface, but through any boundedsurface. As before, the ﬂux through such a surface is deﬁned as the averagenormal component of a vector times the area of the surface. These ideas areillustrated in Fig. 1-3.

Fig. 1-3. The ﬂux of a vector ﬁeldthrough a surface is deﬁned as the aver-age value of the normal component of thevector times the area of the surface.

There is a second property of a vector ﬁeld that has to do with a line, ratherthan a surface. Suppose again that we think of a velocity ﬁeld that describes theﬂow of a liquid. We might ask this interesting question: Is the liquid circulating?

By that we mean: Is there a net rotational motion around some loop? Supposethat we instantaneously freeze the liquid everywhere except inside of a tubewhich is of uniform bore, and which goes in a loop that closes back on itself asin Fig. 1-4. Outside of the tube the liquid stops moving, but inside the tube itmay keep on moving because of the momentum in the trapped liquid — that is,if there is more momentum heading one way around the tube than the other.We deﬁne a quantity called the circulation as the resulting speed of the liquid inthe tube times its circumference. We can again extend our ideas and deﬁne the「circulation」for any vector ﬁeld (even when there isn’t anything moving). Forany vector ﬁeld the circulation around any imagined closed curve is deﬁned asthe average tangential component of the vector (in a consistent sense) multipliedby the circumference of the loop (Fig. 1-5):

```
Circulation = average tangential component x distance around    (1.5)
```

You will see that this deﬁnition does indeed give a number which is proportionalto the circulation velocity in the quickly frozen tube described above.

With just these two ideas — ﬂux and circulation — we can describe all the lawsof electricity and magnetism at once. You may not understand the signiﬁcanceof the laws right away, but they will give you some idea of the way the physics ofelectromagnetism will be ultimately described.

Fig. 1-4. (a) The velocity ﬁeld in a liquid. Imagine a tube of uniform cross section that follows an arbitrary closed curve as in (b). If the liquid were suddenly frozen everywhere except inside the tube, the liquid in the tube would circulate as shown in (c).

1-3 矢量场的特征

矢量场在数学上有两个重要性质，我们将利用它们从场的观点来描述电学定律。若我们想象某种闭合面，并试问是否有「某种东西」从里面流失；这就是说，该场是否有一个「流出」的量？

例如，对于速度场，我们也许要问，该面上的速度是否总是向外，或更普遍地问，是否（每单位时间）流出的流体比流入的多。我们把单位时间流经该面的净流体量称为通过该面的「速度通量」。流经一个面积单元的流量恰好等于垂直该面积的速度分量乘以该面积。对于任一个闭合面，净流出量（或通量）等于速度向外的法向分量的平均值乘以该闭合曲面的面积：

```
通量 = 平均法向分量 x 曲面的面积     (1.4)
```

在电场的情况下，我们可以在数学上定义与流出量相类似的东西，又称作通量，但这当然不是任何物质的流动，因为电场并不是任何东西的速度。然而，事实证明，场法向分量的平均值这个数学上的量仍有其实用意义。于是，我们来谈谈电通量 一一 这也是由式 1.4 定义的。最后，不仅谈论通过一个完全闭合曲面的通量，而且还谈论通过任一个有边界的曲面的通量这也是很有用处的。综上所述，通过这样一个面的通量被定义为矢量的法向分量的平均值乘以该曲面的面积。这些概念如图 1-3 所示。

图 1-3 矢量场通过一个曲面的通量，定义为矢量的法向分量的平均值乘以该曲面的面积

矢量场还有第二个性质，它必须用一条曲线而不是用一个面才能得出。让我们再来回顾一下描写液体流动的速度场，也许会提出这样一个有趣的问题：该液体是否存在环流？我们所说的环流，是指是否有围绕某个环路的净旋转运动？

如图 1-4 所示，假定除在一条口径均匀的环状闭合管子里的液体外，液体突然处处都被冻结了。也就是说，管外的液体都停止了流动，但由于被禁锢的流体内存在着动量（这就是说，围绕管子沿一个方向的动量大于沿另一个方向的动量），所以管内的液体仍可继续流动。我们把管内液体的有效速率乘以该管周长这个量定义为环流。

我们再把上述概念加以引申，而定义任一矢量场的「环流」（即使没有任何东西在流动亦然）。对于任一矢量场，绕任一想象中的闭合曲线的环流可以定义为矢量（沿一致向指）的平均切向分量乘以该回路的周长（图 1-5），即：

```
环流 = 平均切向分量 x 绕行距离      (1.5)
```

你们将会看到，这一定义确实给出了一个正比于上述迅速被冻结的管子里的环流速度的数值。

图 1-4 (a）液体中的速度场；设想有截面均匀、按照图（b）所示的任一闭合曲线安放的管子；假如液体除管内的外，处处都被冻结，那么管里的液体便将按图（c）所示的那样循环流动

只要利用这两个概念 一一 通量与环流 一一 我们就能立即描述电学和磁学的所有定律。你可能不会一下子就理解其意义，但它们将给出有关电磁方面物理学基本描述方法的一些概念。

### 1-4 The laws of electromagnetism

The ﬁrst law of electromagnetism describes the ﬂux of the electric ﬁeld:

```
The ﬂux of E through any closed surface = the net charge inside/ε0 (1.6)
```

where ε0 is a convenient constant. (The constant ε0 is usually read as「epsilon-zero」or「epsilon-naught」.) If there are no charges inside the surface, even though there are charges nearby outside the surface, the average normal component of Eis zero, so there is no net ﬂux through the surface. To show the power of this type of statement, we can show that Eq. (1.6) is the same as Coulomb’s law, provided only that we also add the idea that the ﬁeld from a single charge isspherically symmetric. For a point charge, we draw a sphere around the charge.Then the average normal component is just the value of the magnitude of E atany point, since the ﬁeld must be directed radially and have the same strength for all points on the sphere. Our rule now says that the ﬁeld at the surface of the sphere, times the area of the sphere — that is, the outgoing ﬂux — is proportional to the charge inside. If we were to make the radius of the sphere bigger, the area would increase as the square of the radius. The average normal component of the electric ﬁeld times that area must still be equal to the same charge inside, and so the ﬁeld must decrease as the square of the distance — we get an「inversesquare」ﬁeld.

If we have an arbitrary stationary curve in space and measure the circulation of the electric ﬁeld around the curve, we will ﬁnd that it is not, in general, zero(although it is for the Coulomb ﬁeld). Rather, for electricity there is a second law that states: for any surface S (not closed) whose edge is the curve C,

```
Circulation of E around C = −d/dt(ﬂux of B through S). (1.7)
```

We can complete the laws of the electromagnetic ﬁeld by writing two corresponding equations for the magnetic ﬁeld B:

```
Flux of B through any closed surface = 0. (1.8)
```

For a surface S bounded by the curve C,

```
c2(circulation of B around C) = d/dt(ﬂux of E through S) + ﬂux of electric current through S
```

Fig. 1-5. The circulation of a vector ﬁeldis the average tangential component of thevector (in a consistent sense) times the cir-cumference of the loop.

Fig. 1-6. A bar magnet gives a ﬁeld Bat a wire. When there is a current alongthe wire, the wire moves because of theforce F = qv × B.

The constant c2 that appears in Eq. (1.9) is the square of the velocity of light. It appears because magnetism is in reality a relativistic eﬀect of electricity. The constant 0 has been stuck in to make the units of electric current come out in aconvenient way. Equations (1.6) through (1.9), together with Eq. (1.1), are all the laws of electrodynamics*. As you remember, the laws of Newton were very simple to write down, but they had a lot of complicated consequences and it took us a long time to learn about them all. These laws are not nearly as simple to write down, which means that the consequences are going to be more elaborate and it will take us quite a lot of time to ﬁgure them all out.

We can illustrate some of the laws of electrodynamics by a series of small ex-periments which show qualitatively the interrelationships of electric and magnetic ﬁelds. You have experienced the ﬁrst term of Eq. (1.1) when combing your hair, so we won’t show that one. The second part of Eq. (1.1) can be demonstrated by passing a current through a wire which hangs above a bar magnet, as shownin Fig. 1-6. The wire will move when a current is turned on because of the force F = qv × B. When a current exists, the charges inside the wire are moving, so they have a velocity v, and the magnetic ﬁeld from the magnet exerts a forceon them, which results in pushing the wire sideways. When the wire is pushed to the left, we would expect that the magnet mustfeel a push to the right. (Otherwise we could put the whole thing on a wagonand have a propulsion system that didn’t conserve momentum!) Although theforce is too small to make movement of the bar magnet visible, a more sensitively supported magnet, like a compass needle, will show the movement.

How does the wire push on the magnet? The current in the wire produces amagnetic ﬁeld of its own that exerts forces on the magnet. According to the last term in Eq. (1.9), a current must have a circulation of B — in this case, the lines of B are loops around the wire, as shown in Fig. 1-7. This B-ﬁeld is responsible for the force on the magnet.

Lines of Bfrom wire

Fig. 1-7. The magnetic ﬁeld of the wire exerts a force on the magnet.

* We need only to add a remark about some conventions for the sign of the circulation.

Fig. 1-8. Two wires, carrying current, exert forces on each other.

Equation (1.9) tells us that for a ﬁxed current through the wire the circulation of B is the same for any curve that surrounds the wire. For curves — say circles — that are farther away from the wire, the circumference is larger, so the tangential component of B must decrease. You can see that we would, in fact, expect B todecrease linearly with the distance from a long straight wire.

Now, we have said that a current through a wire produces a magnetic ﬁeld, and that when there is a magnetic ﬁeld present there is a force on a wire carryinga current. Then we should also expect that if we make a magnetic ﬁeld with acurrent in one wire, it should exert a force on another wire which also carriesa current. This can be shown by using two hanging wires as shown in Fig. 1-8. When the currents are in the same direction, the two wires attract, but whenthe currents are opposite, they repel.

In short, electrical currents, as well as magnets, make magnetic ﬁelds. But wait, what is a magnet, anyway? If magnetic ﬁelds are produced by moving charges, is it not possible that the magnetic ﬁeld from a piece of iron is really the result of currents? It appears to be so. We can replace the bar magnet of our experiment with a coil of wire, as shown in Fig. 1-9. When a current is passed through the coil — as well as through the straight wire above it — we observe amotion of the wire exactly as before, when we had a magnet instead of a coil. Inother words, the current in the coil imitates a magnet. It appears, then, that apiece of iron acts as though it contains a perpetual circulating current. We can,in fact, understand magnets in terms of permanent currents in the atoms of theiron. The force on the magnet in Fig. 1-7 is due to the second term in Eq. (1.1).

Fig. 1-9. The bar magnet of Fig. 1-6 canbe replaced by a coil carrying an electricalcurrent. A similar force acts on the wire.

Where do the currents come from? One possibility would be from the motion of the electrons in atomic orbits. Actually, that is not the case for iron, althoughit is for some materials. In addition to moving around in an atom, an electron alsospins about on its own axis — something like the spin of the earth — and it is the current from this spin that gives the magnetic ﬁeld in iron. (We say「something like the spin of the earth」because the question is so deep in quantum mechanicsthat the classical ideas do not really describe things too well.) In most substances, some electrons spin one way and some spin the other, so the magnetism cancelsout, but in iron — for a mysterious reason which we will discuss later — many of the electrons are spinning with their axes lined up, and that is the source of the magnetism.

Since the ﬁelds of magnets are from currents, we do not have to add any extra term to Eqs. (1.8) or (1.9) to take care of magnets. We just take all currents, including the circulating currents of the spinning electrons, and then the law is right. You should also notice that Eq. (1.8) says that there are nomagnetic「charges」analogous to the electrical charges appearing on the rightside of Eq. (1.6). None has been found.

Fig. 1-10. The circulation of B aroundthe curve C is given either by the currentpassing through the surface S1, or by therate of change of the ﬂux of E through thesurface S2.

The ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of Eq. (1.9) was discovered theoretically by Maxwell and is of great importance. It says that changing electric ﬁelds produce magnetic eﬀects. In fact, without this term the equation would not make sense, because without it there could be no currents in circuits that are not complete loops. But such currents do exist, as we can see in the following example. Imagine a capacitor made of two ﬂat plates. It is being charged by a current that ﬂows toward one plate and away from the other, as shown inFig. 1-10. We draw a curve C around one of the wires and ﬁll it in with a surface which crosses the wire, as shown by the surface S1 in the ﬁgure. According to Eq. (1.9), the circulation of B around C (times c2) is given by the current in thewire (divided by 0). But what if we ﬁll in the curve with a diﬀerent surface S2, which is shaped like a bowl and passes between the plates of the capacitor, staying always away from the wire? There is certainly no current through this surface. But, surely, just changing the location of an imaginary surface is not going to change a real magnetic ﬁeld! The circulation of B must be what it was before. The ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of Eq. (1.9) does, indeed, combine with the second term to give the same result for the two surfaces S1 and S2. For S2 the circulation of B is given in terms of the rate of change of the ﬂux of E between the plates of the capacitor. And it works out that the changing E is related tothe current in just the way required for Eq. (1.9) to be correct. Maxwell saw that it was needed, and he was the ﬁrst to write the complete equation.

With the setup shown in Fig. 1-6 we can demonstrate another of the laws of electromagnetism. We disconnect the ends of the hanging wire from the battery and connect them to a galvanometer which tells us when there is a current through the wire. When we push the wire sideways through the magnetic ﬁeld of the magnet, we observe a current. Such an eﬀect is again just another consequence of Eq. (1.1) — the electrons in the wire feel the force F = qv× B. The electrons have a sidewise velocity because they move with the wire. This v with a vertical B from the magnet results in a force on the electrons directed along the wire, which starts the electrons moving toward the galvanometer.

Suppose, however, that we leave the wire alone and move the magnet. We guess from relativity that it should make no diﬀerence, and indeed, we observea similar current in the galvanometer. How does the magnetic ﬁeld produce forces on charges at rest? According to Eq. (1.1) there must be an electric ﬁeld. A moving magnet must make an electric ﬁeld. How that happens is said quantitatively by Eq. (1.7). This equation describes many phenomena of greatpractical interest, such as those that occur in electric generators and transformers.The most remarkable consequence of our equations is that the combination of Eq. (1.7) and Eq. (1.9) contains the explanation of the radiation of electromagnetic eﬀects over large distances. The reason is roughly something like this: supposethat somewhere we have a magnetic ﬁeld which is increasing because, say, acurrent is turned on suddenly in a wire. Then by Eq. (1.7) there must be acirculation of an electric ﬁeld. As the electric ﬁeld builds up to produce itscirculation, then according to Eq. (1.9) a magnetic circulation will be generated. But the building up of this magnetic ﬁeld will produce a new circulation of theelectric ﬁeld, and so on. In this way ﬁelds work their way through space withoutthe need of charges or currents except at their source. That is the way we seeeach other! It is all in the equations of the electromagnetic ﬁelds.

1-4 电磁学定律

电磁学第一个定律对电场通量是这样描述的：

```
通过任一闭合曲面的通量 E = 曲面内的净电荷/ε0  (1.6)
```

式中 `ε0` 是一常数。如果在闭合曲面内没有电荷，即使在曲面外附近存在电荷，E 的法向分量的平均值仍然等于零，所以并没有净通量通过该曲面。为了证明这种表述是强有力的，只要再加上来自单个电荷的场是球对称的这个概念做准备，就可以证明式（1.6）与库仑定律是等同的。

对于一个点电荷，我们做一个包围该电荷的球面，那么，平均法向分量就正好等于 E 在任一点的量值，因为这个场必定是径向的，并且在球面上的任一点具有相同的强度。现在法则讲，在球面上的电场乘以球面面积 一一 即跑出去的通量 一一 正比于球面内的电荷。要是使球的半径增大，则面积按半径的平方增加；电场的平均法向分量乘以该面积仍需等于球面内的电荷，因而该场必定随距离的平方减弱。这就得到了一个「负二次方的」场。

在空间如果我们有一条任意而不动的曲线，并测量电场绕该曲线的环流，那么将发现它一般不等于零（虽则对于库仓定律它为零）。更确切地说，对于电学还存在第二条定律，即对于任一以曲线 C 为边缘的（非闭合）曲面 S：

```
绕 C 的环流 E = d(通过 S 的 B 的通量)/dt   (1.7)
```

再写出下面两个有关磁场 B 的相应方程，我们就能完成电磁场的全部规律。

```
通过任何闭合曲面的通量 B = 0   (1.8)
```

对于以曲线 C 为边界的曲面 S：

```
c^2(B 绕 C 的环流) = d(通过 S 的 E 的通量)/dt + 通过 S 的电流通量/ε0    (1.9)
```

式（1.9）中出现的常数 c^2 为光速的平方，它之所以出现是由于磁实际上是电的一种相对论效应。至于插入常数 `ε0`，则是为了方便地导出电流的单位。

式 1.6-1.9 以及式（1.1）都是电动力学的定律。牛顿定律写起来虽然简单，但它会引出一大堆复杂的结果，而你要深入地学习就得花费很长时间。现在这些定律既然写起来就没有那么简单，那当然意味着其结果将更为复杂，所以我们将花大量时间才能把它们全部弄清楚。

图 1-6 一条形磁铁在导线处给出了磁场 B。当有电流沿导线流动时，该导线由于受力 `F = qv x B` 的作用而运动

通过做一系列小实验（这些实验在定性上表明电场和磁场的关系），我们就能验证某些电动力学定律。当你梳头时，将会对式（1.1）中的第一项有所体验，因而我们就不去证明这一项了。如图 1-6 所示，给悬挂在一条形磁铁上面的导线输入电流，式（1.1）中的第二项可得以演示。当电流接通时，导线由于受力 `F = qv x B` 作用而发生了运动；当存在电流时，线里的电荷在运动，所以它们有一速度，磁铁产生的磁场就会对它们施加作用力，结果把导线推向一旁。

当导线被推向左边时，我们会预料到磁铁必定感受到被推向右边。否则就可将整套设备装在一辆车子上而构成一个动量不守恒的推进系统！虽然这力太小、不足以使磁铁的运动看得见，但被更加灵敏地支撑着的一根磁铁，比如像指南针那样，就会显现出运动来。

导线为什么会推磁铁呢？导线里的电流会产生它自身的磁场，从而施力于磁铁上。按照式（1.9）中的第二项，电流必有一个 B 的环流 一一 在这种情况下，B 线就是环绕该导线的回路，如图 1-7 所示。作用于磁铁上的力，就是由这 B 产生的。

图 1-7 导线的磁场施力于磁铁

式（1.9）还告诉我们，对于通过导线的一个恒定电流，对围绕导线的任何曲线 B 的环流都相同。由于曲线 一一 比方说是一圆周 一一 距离导线越远，则其周长越长，B 的切向分量就必然减小。你可以看到，事实上我们该期待 B 随着离开长直导线的距离线性地减弱。

现在，我们已经说过，流经导线的电流会产生磁场；而当有磁场存在时，就有一力作用于载有电流的导线上。于是我们也预料到，如果用导线中的电流来产生磁场，则它会对另一载流导线施一作用力。这可由采用如图 1-8 所示的两根悬挂导线来做演示。当两电流同向时，两导线相吸；但当两电流方向相反时，它们将相斥。

图 1-8 两条通电流的导线互相有力作用着

简言之，电流和磁铁均会产生磁场。且慢！试问磁铁究竟是什么？如果磁场是由运动电荷产生的，那么，来自一块磁铁的磁场是否有可能也是由于电流的原因呢？看来的确是这样。我们可以将实验中的条形磁铁用一个导电线圈来代替，如图 1-9 所示。当电流通过线圈同时也有电流通过在线圈上面的那根直导线 一一 时，我们便会观察到导线的运动与以前用磁铁而不用线圈时完全一样。换言之，线圈里的电流模仿了一块磁铁。因此，看来一块磁铁的作用就如同它含有一种永恒的环行电流一样。事实上，我们可以用铁原子中的恒定电流来理解磁铁。在图 1-7 中，作用在磁铁上的力就是由式（1.1）中的第二项引起的。

究竟这些电流是从哪里来的呢？一种可能来自原子轨道中电子的运动。实际上虽然对于某些材料来说这是正确的，但对铁来说却是不正确的。一个电子，除了在原子中环行之外，还绕它本身的轴旋转 一一 有些像地球的自转 —— 正是由于自旋所产生的电流才为铁提供了磁场（我们说「有些像地球的自转」，是因为这一问题在量子力学中竟是那么奥妙，以致一些经典概念并不能真正恰当地描述这些事物）。在大多数物质中，有些电子这样自旋，另一些电子那样自旋，所以磁性互相抵消；可是在铁里 一一 由于某个我们将在以后加以讨论的神秘原因 一一 有许多电子却绕着它们的排列整齐的轴旋转着，这正是磁性的起源。

1『磁铁有磁场的原理，做一张信息数据卡片。』—— 已完成

图 1-9 图 1-6 中的磁铁可用一个流线来代替，有一相似的力作用在导线上

由于磁铁的场都是来自电流，所以我们无需因存在磁铁而在式（1.8）和（1.9）中引进任何额外的项。我们只要取所有的电流，包括自旋电子的环行电流，那么该定律就对了。但你亦应注意，式（1.8）说明不存在与出现在式（1.6）右边的电荷相类似的磁「荷」。没有人曾发现过磁荷。

式（1.9）右边的第一项是由麦克斯韦从理论上发现的，而且十分重要。它说明一个变化着的电场会产生磁场。事实上，若没有这一项，该方程便毫无意义。若无此项，则在一非完整的回路中便不会有电流。但正如我们在下述例子中将见到的这样的电流确实存在。

图 1-10 B 绕曲线 C 的环流，既可以由通过面 S1 的电流给出，也可以由通过面 S2 的 E 的通量变化率给出

设想一个由两块平行板构成的电容器，它正在充电，电流流向其中一极板而流出另一极板，如图 1-10 所示。若围绕着其中一条导线画一条曲线 C，并用一个被该导线贯穿的、如图中所示的 S1 面来盖满这条曲线，按照式（1.9），B 绕 C 的环流由导线中的电流乘以 c^2 给出。可是若我们用另一个形状像碗、并通过电容器两板间、始终保持在导线外面的一个不同的曲面 S2 来盖满，那又将怎样呢？肯定不会有任何电流通过这一个曲面。然而，仅仅改变一下想象中的曲面位置，总绝不会改变一个实际的磁场吧！B 的环流必然和以前一样。是的，对于 S1 和 S2 两个面，式（1.9）右边的第一项和第二项相结合，确实会给出相同的结果。对于 S2 来说，B 的环流由电容器两板间 E 的通量的变化率给出。可以通过计算证明，正在变化着的 E 与电流之间是用那种使式（1.9）保持正确所必需的方式相联系的。麦克斯韦看到了它的必要性，因而首先写出了完整方程。

采用图 1-6 所示的那种装置，我们可以演示另一个电磁学定律。将悬挂导线两端从电池上断开，接在一个电流计上，它会告诉我们何时有电流通过该导线。当在磁铁产生的磁场中向旁推动导线时，便会观察到电流。这样一个效应恰恰是式（1.1）的另一个结果 —— 导线中的电子感受到了力 `F = q(E + v × B)`。电子之所以具有侧向速度，是因为它们随导线一起运动。这个 v 同来自磁铁的垂直方向的 B 一起产生了一个作用于电子上的、沿导线方向的力，此力引起电子向电流计运动。

然而，假定我们移动的不是导线而是磁铁，从相对性来讲，可猜测到这不应当产生任何差别。的确，我们在电流计中观察到一个相似电流。磁场怎么会产生作用于静止电荷上的力呢？按照式（1.1）一定存在一个电场。一根运动的磁铁必定产生电场。这过程怎样发生，可以由式（1.7）定量地给予说明。这个方程描述了许多具有巨大实际价值的现象，诸如那些出现在发电机和变压器中的现象。

我们的方程组最引人注目的一个结果是，式（1.7）和（1.9）包含着关于在很大距离范围内的电磁辐射效应的解释。解释大致如下：假设由于导线里电流突然接通，就使得某处的磁场增大；于是，根据式（1.7）就必然存在一个电场的环流；当这建立起来的电场产生环流时，根据式（1.9）又一个磁的环流将形成；可是，这个磁场的建立又将产生一个新的电场环流…... 依此类推。就这样，场在通过空间前进时，除了在它们的发源处外，并不需要电荷或电流。这就是我们都能够互相看见的关键所在！这一切都存在于电磁场的方程组中。

### 1-5 What are the ﬁelds?






We now make a few remarks on our way of looking at this subject. You maybe saying:「All this business of ﬂuxes and circulations is pretty abstract. Thereare electric ﬁelds at every point in space; then there are these ‘laws.’ But what isactually happening? Why can’t you explain it, for instance, by whatever it is thatgoes between the charges.」Well, it depends on your prejudices. Many physicistsused to say that direct action with nothing in between was inconceivable. (Howcould they ﬁnd an idea inconceivable when it had already been conceived?) Theywould say:「Look, the only forces we know are the direct action of one piece ofmatter on another. It is impossible that there can be a force with nothing totransmit it.」But what really happens when we study the「direct action」of onepiece of matter right against another? We discover that it is not one piece rightagainst the other; they are slightly separated, and there are electrical forces actingon a tiny scale. Thus we ﬁnd that we are going to explain so-called direct-contactaction in terms of the picture for electrical forces. It is certainly not sensible totry to insist that an electrical force has to look like the old, familiar, muscularpush or pull, when it will turn out that the muscular pushes and pulls are goingto be interpreted as electrical forces! The only sensible question is what is themost convenient way to look at electrical eﬀects. Some people prefer to representthem as the interaction at a distance of charges, and to use a complicated law.Others love the ﬁeld lines. They draw ﬁeld lines all the time, and feel that writingE’s and B’s is too abstract. The ﬁeld lines, however, are only a crude way ofdescribing a ﬁeld, and it is very diﬃcult to give the correct, quantitative lawsdirectly in terms of ﬁeld lines. Also, the ideas of the ﬁeld lines do not containthe deepest principle of electrodynamics, which is the superposition principle.Even though we know how the ﬁeld lines look for one set of charges and whatthe ﬁeld lines look like for another set of charges, we don’t get any idea aboutwhat the ﬁeld line patterns will look like when both sets are present together.From the mathematical standpoint, on the other hand, superposition is easy — wesimply add the two vectors. The ﬁeld lines have some advantage in giving a vividpicture, but they also have some disadvantages. The direct interaction way ofthinking has great advantages when thinking of electrical charges at rest, buthas great disadvantages when dealing with charges in rapid motion.

The best way is to use the abstract ﬁeld idea. That it is abstract is unfortunate,but necessary. The attempts to try to represent the electric ﬁeld as the motionof some kind of gear wheels, or in terms of lines, or of stresses in some kind ofmaterial have used up more eﬀort of physicists than it would have taken simplyto get the right answers about electrodynamics. It is interesting that the correctequations for the behavior of light were worked out by MacCullagh in 1839.1-9

But people said to him:「Yes, but there is no real material whose mechanicalproperties could possibly satisfy those equations, and since light is an oscillationthat must vibrate in something, we cannot believe this abstract equation business.」If people had been more open-minded, they might have believed in the rightequations for the behavior of light a lot earlier than they did.

In the case of the magnetic ﬁeld we can make the following point: Supposethat you ﬁnally succeeded in making up a picture of the magnetic ﬁeld in termsof some kind of lines or of gear wheels running through space. Then you try toexplain what happens to two charges moving in space, both at the same speedand parallel to each other. Because they are moving, they will behave like twocurrents and will have a magnetic ﬁeld associated with them (like the currents inthe wires of Fig. 1-8). An observer who was riding along with the two charges,however, would see both charges as stationary, and would say that there is nomagnetic ﬁeld. The「gear wheels」or「lines」disappear when you ride along withthe object! All we have done is to invent a new problem. How can the gearwheels disappear?! The people who draw ﬁeld lines are in a similar diﬃculty.Not only is it not possible to say whether the ﬁeld lines move or do not movewith charges — they may disappear completely in certain coordinate frames.

What we are saying, then, is that magnetism is really a relativistic eﬀect. Inthe case of the two charges we just considered, travelling parallel to each other, wewould expect to have to make relativistic corrections to their motion, with termsof order v2/c2. These corrections must correspond to the magnetic force. Butwhat about the force between the two wires in our experiment (Fig. 1-8). Therethe magnetic force is the whole force. It didn’t look like a「relativistic correction.」Also, if we estimate the velocities of the electrons in the wire (you can do thisyourself), we ﬁnd that their average speed along the wire is about 0.01 centimeterper second. So v2/c2 is about 10−25. Surely a negligible「correction.」But no!Although the magnetic force is, in this case, 10−25 of the「normal」electricalforce between the moving electrons, remember that the「normal」electrical forceshave disappeared because of the almost perfect balancing out — because the wireshave the same number of protons as electrons. The balance is much more precisethan one part in 1025, and the small relativistic term which we call the magneticforce is the only term left. It becomes the dominant term.

It is the near-perfect cancellation of electrical eﬀects which allowed relativityeﬀects (that is, magnetism) to be studied and the correct equations — to or-der v2/c2 — to be discovered, even though physicists didn’t know that’s what washappening. And that is why, when relativity was discovered, the electromagneticlaws didn’t need to be changed. They — unlike mechanics — were already correctto a precision of v2/c2.

1-5 场是什么

现在就我们对这一课题的看法讲几点意见。你也许会说：「所有这种关于通量和环流的概念太抽象了。由于空间每一点存在电场，所以才有这些定律。但实际发生的情况是什么？为什么你不能用（例如）有什么东西在电荷之间起作用来加以解释呢？」唔，这与你的偏见有关。许多物理学家经常说，中间没有任何东西的那种直接作用是不可思议的。（既然某一概念已经被想象出来，他们怎么能断定它是不可思议的呢？）他们会说：「看！我们现在知道这种单独的力就是一个物体对另一个物体的直接作用。不可能存在一种无需由媒质来传递的力。」但当我们研究一个物体紧靠着另一个物体的「直接作用」时，真正发生的是什么呢？我们发现，并不是一个物体紧靠着另一个物体，而是彼此稍微有点分开，而在微小尺度内有电力起着作用。这样，我们知道将要用电力的图像来解释所谓的直接接触作用。既然肌肉的推拉力将要用电力来加以说明，那么还试图坚持认为得把电力看成像那种古老的、大家所熟悉的肌肉推拉力，那肯定是不合理的！

唯一通情达理的问题是，什么才是看待电效应的最方便途径？有些人宁可把这些效应表达成在电荷间距的互作用，从而采用一个复杂定律。另外一些人则喜欢利用场线。他们老是画场线，而感到写出 E 和 B 则是太抽象了。然而场线只不过是描写场的一种粗略的办法，要用场线直接给出那些正确而又定量的定律是很困难的。而且，场线概念并不含有电动力学最深刻的原理，即叠加原理。即使我们已知道了一组电荷的场线看起来是怎么回事，而另一组电荷的场线看来像什么，但当两组电荷同时存在时场线的图样究竟会怎么样，我们就毫无概念了。另一方面，从数学的观点看，叠加很容易 一一 我们只需把两矢量相加起来。场线对于提供一个生动图像具有某种优点，可是也有一些缺点。当认为电荷处于静止状态时直接相互作用的想法固然有极大优点，但当涉及迅速运动的电荷时就具有一些重大缺点。

最好的办法是采用抽象的场概念。抽象虽然可惜，但却是必要的。尝试把电场用某种齿轮的运动、或用线、或用某种材料的张力来表示的企图所耗费的物理学家们的精力，比起仅仅获得电动力学的正确答案所必需的大概要多得多。有趣的是，关于晶体中的光的行为的正确方程已由麦卡洛于 1839 年得出。可是人们却对他说：「是的，但没有任何实际物质其机械性能满足那些方程，而且由于光应当是在某种东西中的一种振动，所以我们不可能相信这个抽象的方程式。」要是人们稍微虚心一点，他们也许在早得多的时候就相信关于光的行为的正确方程了。

对于磁场的情况，我们可提出如下要点：假定你最后已能够成功地用某种线或某种通过空间运转的齿轮构成一幅关于磁场的图像；然后，你尝试说明两个以相同速率互相平行地在空间运动的电荷所发生的情况。既然它们在运动，那么它们就将起两个电流一样的作用，并会有磁场和它们联系在一起（就像图 1-8 中导线里的电流那样）。可是，一个跟随这两个电荷做曲线运动的观察者将会把它们看作是静止不动的，从而会说那里没有磁场。当你随同物体一道运动时，就连「齿轮」或「线」也都消失不见了！上面我们所做的只是为了想出一个新问题。那些齿轮怎么能消失呢？那些画场线的人们也陷入了同样的困境。不仅不能说明场线是否随着电荷一起运动，而且在某些参照系中这些场线可能完全消失。

于是，我们讲，磁性实际上是一种相对论效应。就我们刚才所考虑的两个做平行运动的电荷的情况来说，我们应期望对于它们的运动得用数量级为 `v^2/c^2` 的项来做相对论修正。这些修正应当与磁力相一致。但在我们的实验（图 1-8）中，出现于两根导线间的力是怎么回事呢？那里的磁力是全部磁力。这看来似平不像是一种「相对论修正」。而且，倘若我们估计一下导线里电子的速度（你们可自行算出来），则我们求得它们沿导线的平均速率约为 0.01cm/s。所以 `v^2/c^2` 约等于 10^-25，这肯定是一个可以忽略的「修正」。可是不对！尽管在这一情况下，磁力仅等于两运动电荷的「正常」电力的 10^-25 倍，但应当记住，由于几乎完全中和 一一 即由于导线里存在相同数目的质子和电子，「正常」电力已经完全消失了。由于中和的程度远较 1/10^25 来得准确，从而那个我们称之为磁力的小小相对论项就是唯一剩下来的项，所以它变成了主要的项。

正是由于电效应几乎完全抵消，才使得相对论效应（即磁现象）受到研究，而其正确方程组 —— 准确至 `v^2/c^2` 才被发现，虽则当时物理学家还不懂得发生的是什么事情。而这就是为什么当相对论被发现时，电磁学定律并不需要改变。它们 一一 不像力学 ー一 已准确至 `v^2/c^2` 的精度了。

### 1-6 Electromagnetism in science and technology

Let us end this chapter by pointing out that among the many phenomenastudied by the Greeks there were two very strange ones: that if you rubbed apiece of amber you could lift up little pieces of papyrus, and that there was astrange rock from the island of Magnesia which attracted iron. It is amazing tothink that these were the only phenomena known to the Greeks in which theeﬀects of electricity or magnetism were apparent. The reason that these werethe only phenomena that appeared is due primarily to the fantastic precisionof the balancing of charges that we mentioned earlier. Study by scientists whocame after the Greeks uncovered one new phenomenon after another that werereally some aspect of these amber and/or lodestone eﬀects. Now we realize thatthe phenomena of chemical interaction and, ultimately, of life itself are to beunderstood in terms of electromagnetism.

At the same time that an understanding of the subject of electromagnetism wasbeing developed, technical possibilities that deﬁed the imagination of the peoplethat came before were appearing: it became possible to signal by telegraph overlong distances, and to talk to another person miles away without any connectionsbetween, and to run huge power systems — a great water wheel, connected by1-10

ﬁlaments over hundreds of miles to another engine that turns in response to themaster wheel — many thousands of branching ﬁlaments — ten thousand engines inten thousand places running the machines of industries and homes — all turningbecause of the knowledge of the laws of electromagnetism.

Today we are applying even more subtle eﬀects. The electrical forces, enormousas they are, can also be very tiny, and we can control them and use them in verymany ways. So delicate are our instruments that we can tell what a man is doingby the way he aﬀects the electrons in a thin metal rod hundreds of miles away.All we need to do is to use the rod as an antenna for a television receiver!

From a long view of the history of mankind — seen from, say, ten thousandyears from now — there can be little doubt that the most signiﬁcant event of the19th century will be judged as Maxwell’s discovery of the laws of electrodynamics.The American Civil War will pale into provincial insigniﬁcance in comparisonwith this important scientiﬁc event of the same decade.

1-6 科学技术中的电磁学

让我们指出下述事件来结束本章。希腊人所研究的许多种现象中有两种是十分奇特的：如果你擦擦琥珀，你就可用它来吸起一些小纸片；又有一种来自麦尼西亚（Magnesia）岛的奇怪石头会吸铁。这是为希腊人所知道的、电磁效应表现得很明显的、仅有的现象，想起就令人惊奇。之所以仅仅出现这两种现象，其原因主要在于早先提到的电荷间异常精确的中和作用。通过希腊人之后的科学家的研究，发现了一个又一个的新现象，而这些实际上都不过是这些琥珀和（或）磁石效应的某些方面而已。现在我们认识到，化学作用的现象、以及最终生命本身的现象都要用电磁学来加以理解。

在人们对电磁学这一课题的认识正在提高的同时，以往不敢去想象的一些技术上可能发生的事出现了，从而，下述这些事就成为可能：在超长距离之间通讯；同几英里外中间没有任何联线的另一个人说话；以及开动巨大的电力系统 一一 一个巨大的水轮，用数百英里以上的细线与别的发动机相连接，该发动机随主轮而转动 一一 无数支线在上万的地方与成万台发动机相连，开动着工厂和家庭中的机器 一一 所有这些，都是由于电磁学定律的知识而运转起来的。

今天我们应用着更为精细的效应。电力既可巨大，也可以十分微小，而我们都能够控制它们，并在许多方面加以利用。我们的仪器是如此精密，以致某人对数百英里外的一根细小金属棒中的电子施以影响的同时，你就能说出他正在干什么。我们只要把该金属棒作为电视机的天线就可！

从人类历史的长远观点来看 一一 例如过一万年之后回头来看 一一 毫无疑问，在 19 世纪中发生的最有意义事件将被认为是麦克斯韦对电磁学定律的发现。与这一重大科学事件相比，同一个十年中发生的美国内战，将降为一个地区性琐事而黯然失色。

我们在生活中能接触到的物理现象其实就那么几种。你搬运东西、测量一个什么运动的速度，那是力学；你能看到周围的事物，欣赏各种颜色，那是光学；你家里的一切家用电器，几乎都来自电磁学。

电磁学并不神秘。什么是电呢？电就是电荷之间的相互作用。电子带负电，离子带正电，电子跟离子之间就有一个吸引力，而两个电子或者两个离子之间就有一个排斥力，也就是同性相斥，异性相吸。

那什么是磁呢？磁来源于电，是电荷的运动产生磁。一段导体中有电流，它周围就会有磁性。像我们平时看到的磁铁，也无非就是其中原子排列的很整齐，每个原子周围电子的运动带来的磁力。

而如果用物理学家的眼光理解电磁现象，你必须得掌握一个概念，叫做「场」。

两个电荷之间发生吸引，请问这个吸引力是怎么感觉到的呢？难道一个电荷「隔空」就能感到另一个电荷的存在吗？这里边可没有什么「超距作用」。每个电荷都会在自己的周围形成一个「电场」，另一个电荷不是跟这个电荷直接发生相互作用，而是跟这个电荷的电场发生相互作用 —— 

图中那些带箭头的曲线就是电场的形状和走向。类似地，磁力，其实也是以「磁场」的形式在周围空间存在 ——

确切地说，是所有的电场和磁场重叠在一起，形成一个总的电磁场，然后各个带电物质根据自己所在位置的电磁场来决定自己怎么运动。

电磁场可不是物理学家的想象，而是客观存在的东西，你完全可以用仪器探测出来。我记得爱因斯坦曾经有一句话说，「场，就好像我坐的这把椅子一样真实。」当然现在有些神神叨叨的人说气功高手能体察到「能量场」、名人的周围有「气场」，那些「场」就不是电磁场了。

麦克斯韦之前的物理学家已经对电磁现象做过各种研究。特别是法拉第，在实验室里发现，变化的磁场能够带来一个电流，也就是说「磁能生电」。像这些电磁现象都很有意思，你完全可以编写一本书，列举科学家已有的电磁学知识 —— 但是这些知识有点杂乱无章，就好像一本写满了各地风土人情的菜谱。

麦克斯韦要做的事情，有点像是一位好学的武林高手，博采众家之长，融会贯通之后，创立了自己的武学。

这门学问不但是一统江湖，而且还推演出一些前人根本没想到过的新物理来。

1860 年代初期，麦克斯韦提出一组总共四个方程，来描写「所有的」电磁现象。这就是著名的麦克斯韦方程组，它们写出来非常漂亮 —— 

前三个方程分别说的是：1）电荷产生电场；2）没有磁荷；3）变化的磁场也能产生电场。4）第 4 个方程右边的第一项说的是电流产生磁场，所有这些都是当时已知的物理知识。

我们重点说说它的第二项。这一项就是麦克斯韦的独特发现。一方面，是麦克斯韦考虑电和磁之间应该有一个对偶的关系。那既然法拉第的实验证明变化的磁场能产生电场，变化的电场是不是也能产生磁场呢？另一方面，这一项也是让方程组在数学上自洽、让电荷数守恒的要求。这一项，就是说变化的电场也能产生磁场。

后来人们用实验证明麦克斯韦是对的。但是请注意，麦克斯韦这个发现纯粹是理论推导出来的！这就好比说一个侦探，听取了各方的信息之后突然就推断出来一个人们意想不到的结论。而麦克斯韦用的仅仅是数学。

好，现在麦克斯韦知道 —— 1）变化的磁场能产生电场。2）变化的电场又能产生磁场。

那首先你就能看出来，电和磁其实在某种程度上是「一回事儿」，电场和磁场可以互相产生，就算没有电荷，用磁场也能产生电场。

但麦克斯韦紧接着想到，如果我用线圈弄一个震荡的电流，产生一个周期变化的磁场，那么这个周期变化磁场就能产生一个周期变化的电场，而这个周期变化的电场又能产生新的周期变化的磁场……以此类推，岂不是说这个电磁场可以一直传播下去吗？

这就是电磁波！二十多年以后人们真的在实验中制造了电磁波，给后世生活带来巨大的影响，不过麦克斯韦在意的不是电磁波的实用价值。

麦克斯韦可以用他的方程组直接计算这个电磁波的传播速度。他算出来电磁波速度，发现跟光速，它们的数值是一样的！

光是有速度的。你打开一盏灯，光线不会瞬间传播到宇宙的另一头去。当时的人已经在实验中测量了光速。而且早在 1801 年人们就已经知道光是一种波。但是人们并不知道光到底是怎么回事。

而现在麦克斯韦计算得出的电磁波的速度正好是光速，于是麦克斯韦大胆宣称，光，其实就是电磁波。后来人们证实果然是这样，我们平时所见的可见光无非就是特定频率的电磁波而已。

这是物理学家再一次看破了红尘。天上的东西和地上是一回事儿，匀速直线运动和静止是一回事，电和磁是一回事儿，而现在麦克斯韦说，光跟电磁场，其实也是一回事儿。

这么一来，物理学的逻辑结构就变得更简单了。牛顿力学加上麦克斯韦电磁学，身边的一切物理现象等于是都被理解了。这绝对是英雄的壮举。

但是这个成就里边有一个危机。
