## NOTES

INTRODUCTION

1. The Industrial Revolution is variously described as starting anywhere from the mid-eighteenth to the early nineteenth centuries. I choose the year 1775 somewhat arbitrarily as it coincides with the invention of James Watt's steam engine and because it is a nice round number.

2. Steven Pinker, The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined (New York: Viking, Kindle edition, 2011); locations 3279–3282.

3. Much of the manuscript production took place at monasteries. Belgium often had among the highest rates of manuscript production per capita because of its abundant monasteries. Relieved of their need to produce manuscripts, a few of these monasteries instead began to shift their focus to producing their wonderful Trappist beers. So another of those unintended consequences: Gutenberg's invention, however indirectly, may be at least a little bit responsible for improving the quality of the world's beer.

That which has been is what will be,

That which is done is what will be done,

And there is nothing new under the sun.

Is there anything of which it may be said,

"See, this is new"?

It has already been in ancient times before us.

There is no remembrance of former things,

Nor will there be any remembrance of things that are to come

By those who will come after.

34. I use the number of patent applications rather than patent grants for this metric because patent grants can be slowed by bureaucratic backlog. Among the only real bipartisan accomplishments of the 112th Congress was the passage of the America Invents Act in September 2011, which was passed by a an 89–9 majority in the Senate and sped patent applications.

Although the polling on the bailout bills was somewhat ambiguous at the time they were passed, later statistical analyses suggested that members of Congress who had voted for the bailout were more likely to lose their seats.

11. Most of the CDOs that did not default outright are nevertheless now close to worthless; more than 90 percent of the mortgage-backed securities issued during 2006 and 2007 have since been downgraded to below investment-grade (BlackRock Solutions, as of May 7, 2010; per a presentation provided to author by Anil Kashyap, University of Chicago).

13. This remains S&P's first line of defense today. When I contacted an S&P spokeswoman, Catherine Mathis, in September 2011, asking for an interview on their ratings of mortgage-backed debt, she responded in nearly identical language. "We were not alone, which you should point out," she wrote in an e-mail. "Many homeowners, financial institutions, policy makers, and investors did not expect the U.S. housing market to decline as quickly or as far as it did." S&P declined my request for a full interview. For additional evidence on this point, see Kristopher S. Gerardi, Andreas Lehnert, Shane M. Sherlund and Paul S. Willen, "Making Sense of the Subprime Crisis," Public Policy Discussion Papers No. 09-1, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, December 22, 2008. http://www.bos.frb.org/economic/ppdp/2009/ppdp0901.htm.

21. The volume of discussion in the news media forms a parallel to that of the stock market bubble in the late 1990s, references to which increased tenfold in news accounts between 1994 and 1999, peaking just the year before markets crashed.

25. Hedge funds and other sophisticated investors generally do not have these requirements: they will do their own due diligence on a security, happy to bet against a ratings agency's forecast when warranted (as it often is). But public pension funds and other institutional investors like college endowments are stuck. Jane's retirement savings and Johnny's college scholarship are dependent on the accuracy of the ratings agencies, while a hedge fund leaves itself the flexibility to make the big short.

26. Per interview with Jules Kroll.

27. Another catch-22 is that historically an NRSRO was required to be in business for three years before it could start rating securities. But without any ratings revenues, there was no way for the business to get off the ground.

28. Moody's is the only one of the three major agencies that does most of its business through its credit ratings alone. S&P, by contrast, is a part of McGraw-Hill, a publishing company, making its financials harder to scrutinize.

40. The 20 percent chance of default refers to the rate over a five-year period.

41. And it can get worse than that. These securities can also be combined into derivatives of one another, which are even more highly leveraged. For instance, five Alpha Pools of mortgage debt could be combined into a Super Alpha Pool, which would pay you out unless all five of the underlying Alpha Pools defaulted. The odds of this happening are just one in 336 nonillion (a one followed by thirty zeroes) if the mortgages are perfectly uncorrelated with one another—but 1 in 20 if they are perfectly correlated, meaning that it is leveraged by a multiple of 16,777,215,999,999,900,000,000,000,000,000.

47. Why is this the case? "For most of the U.S., land is abundant," Anil Kashyap explained in a note to me. "So the value of a house and a plot of land is about what the cost of construction would be. With all the technical progress in building, construction costs have fallen steadily. So expecting appreciation is doubtful. The big exception is places where there are building restrictions. One way to see this is to notice that Texas had almost no bubble. Why? Because there is no zoning and few natural limitations."

48. During the 1950s, consumers had extraordinarily rich balance sheets. For a variety of reasons—prudence brought on by the memory of the Great Depression, restrictions on prices and production of consumer goods during the war years, and a booming labor market that required all hands on deck—Americans had an unprecedented amount of savings. During World War II, Americans kept as much as 25 percent of their incomes, and savings rates remained elevated in the years that followed.

57. Some economists I spoke with, like Jan Hatzius, dispute the Case–Schiller data, noting that the quality of housing data is questionable prior to the 1950s. But even using 1953 as a starting point—when the data quality significantly improves—there had been no overall increase in the value of homes between 1953 and 1996. The paper gains that homeowners may have thought they had achieved were no more than enough to pay for inflation.

71. Figures are based on reports from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which show an average daily trading volume in the mortgage-backed securities market of $320 billion per day. Over 250 trading days, this works out to about $80 trillion in trades over the course of a year.

83. This is my example, not Summers's, who instead gave me an example involving the price of wheat.

84. Although lemonade does not behave this way, economists have sometimes debated whether another tasty beverage—French wine—does. Over certain price ranges, increasing the price of a wine may increase demand because the customer sees high price as a signifier of superior quality. Eventually, though, even the most spendthrift oenophiles are priced out, so the positive feedback does not continue indefinitely.

85. Per interview with George Akerlof. "You may know what to pay for House A versus House B versus House C because you can say one has a kitchen with gadgets that is worth $500 more than House B, which has a kitchen with no gadgets. But you don't know what the price of a house should be."

88. This is one reason why it may not be harmful—some studies have even claimed that it may be helpful—for a president to experience a recession early in his term. The American economy was in recession in 1982, for example, but recovered from it with spectacular 8 percent growth in 1983 and 6 percent growth in 1984, helping Ronald Reagan to a landslide victory for a second term. There is some evidence, in fact, that presidents may have enough influence on fiscal and monetary policy to help perpetuate these outcomes. Since 1948, the median rate of GDP growth is 2.7 percent in the first year of a president's term and 2.8 percent in the second year—but 4.2 percent in both the third and the fourth years.

93. For instance, the Wall Street Journal forecasting panel in January 2009 predicted that unemployment would rise to 8.5 percent by the end of the year. By contrast, the White House's "without stimulus" forecast predicted 9.0 percent, whereas their "with stimulus" forecast predicted 7.8 percent. Since the Wall Street Journal panel would not have known at the time about what magnitude of stimulus might be passed, it is not surprising that they wound up somewhere in between the two cases.

However, the White House's "with stimulus" forecast claimed unemployment would actually fall between the first half and second half of 2009, something which no consensus forecast from the Wall Street Journal panel or the Survey of Professional Forecasters ever did. So, although the White House's forecast wasn't all that far removed from private-sector forecasts in anticipating where the unemployment rate would end up by the close of 2009, it did envision a different trajectory, anticipating that the curve would already be bending downward by that point in time.

Pundits as Political Forecasters," The International Journal of Press/Politics 1, 1 (January 1996). http://hij.sagepub.com/content/1/1/33.abstract.

6. Predictions were not evaluated for one of three reasons: the panelist's answer was too vague to formulate a testable hypothesis, or the prediction concerned an event in the distant future, or the panelist dodged McLaughlin's question and did not issue a prediction at all.

7. Two of the less-frequent panelists, Clarence Page and Mort Zuckerman, had more promising results, while Crowley's were especially poor—but none of these trends were meaningful statistically.

12. The CIA's incorrect estimates of the Soviet Union's GDP came in part because they were looking at the country's impressive military and extrapolating backward from that to estimate the overall size of its economy. But the Soviet Union was spending a much higher percentage of its domestic product on its military than were the free economies of Europe and North America.

22. FiveThirtyEight's forecasting model, which has no insider knowledge, called nine of the eleven races correctly—better than both the Democratic insiders (who called an average of 6.9 right) and the Republicans (8.4).

23. Note that these predictions weren't even internally consistent: if Democratic insiders expected to win almost all the marginal races, for instance, they ought to have predicted their party would perform well enough to hold the House.

24. Although race and gender were certainly key factors in the 2008 race, the media often defaulted to them as explanations when there were better hypotheses at hand. For instance, at some points in the 2008 primary campaign, it was noted that Obama was doing relatively poorly among Hispanic voters, the implication almost always being that Hispanic voters distrusted black candidates. In fact, I later found, Obama's lagging numbers among Hispanics had little do to with their race and everything to do with their income status. Clinton generally did better with working-class voters, and because many Hispanics were working-class, she also did better with that group. But controlling for income, there was essentially no difference in Clinton's performance among whites and Hispanics. And indeed, Obama had little trouble winning Hispanic votes once he squared off against the Republican nominee, John McCain, taking about two-thirds of their votes.

32. Hibbs's model predicted Al Gore to win 54.8 percent of the two-party vote (that is, excluding votes for third-party candidates) when Gore in fact won 50.3 percent—an error of 4.5 percent. His model claimed to have a standard error of about 2 points in predicting any one candidate's vote share (or about 4 points when predicting the margin between them). His forecast thus overestimated Gore's standing by 2.25 standard deviations, something that should occur only about 1 in 80 times according to the normal distribution.

36. Between 1998 and 2008, the average poll for a U.S. Senate race conducted in the final three weeks of the campaign missed by 5.0 points, whereas the average poll for a U.S. House race missed by 5.8 points.

37. One mild criticism of Cook Political's methodology is that they classify too many races as Toss-Up, even where there is probably enough evidence to posit a modest advantage for one or another of the candidates. FiveThirtyEight's methodology, which identifies a nominal favorite in all races no matter how slim his apparent advantage, correctly identified the winner in thirty-eight of the fifty races (76 percent) that Cook Political characterized as Toss-Up in 2010.

38. Between 1998 and 2010, there were seventeen instances in which Cook classified a race one way (favoring the Democrat, for instance) while the average of polls came to the opposite conclusion (perhaps finding a narrow advantage for the Republican). The Cook forecasts made the right call in thirteen of those seventeen cases.

41. Cook Political eventually moved its rating to Lean Democrat from Likely Democrat several weeks later, but on account of the Democrats' deteriorating situation in the national political environment rather than anything that had happened during Kapanke's interview.

18. I chose World War II as a cutoff point because a number of developments occurred shortly after the war that made professional baseball the modern game that it is today: the breaking of the color barrier by Jackie Robinson (1947); the first televised World Series (1947); the movement of teams to the West Coast (1957); the introduction of night baseball, which had initially occurred as early as 1935 but gained more currency during the war as workers put in long hours at factories and needed some recreation at night.

34. It should be noted, however, that with the average major-league payroll now at about $100 million, a forecasting system that allowed a baseball team to spend its money 2 percent more efficiently would save them $2 million. Compared with the five-figure salaries that statistical analysts receive in major league front offices, that's quite a bargain.

39. Why teams persisted in believing the contrary for so long is a good question. It may have had to do with the fact that a walk was traditionally perceived as a mistake made by the pitcher, rather than a skill exhibited by the batter. It may have been that a walk is perceived as too passive in a culture that prizes machismo. But the industry has grown wise to the value of OBP, which is now the category most highly correlated with salaries paid to free agents. So the A's can no longer exploit the inefficiency—after years of finishing near the top of the league in walks drawn, they placed just tenth out of fourteen American League teams in the category in 2009.

41. Per interview with John Sanders.

42. Players spend their first two major-league seasons subject to something called the reserve clause, which dictates that they may not sign with any other clubs. This means that the player has almost no leverage at all, and is usually signed for something close to the league minimum salary of $400,000. After that, he spends his third through sixth years subject to arbitration, in which both he and the team submit salary requests, and a three-person panel decides which is the more appropriate. But salaries awarded in arbitration are typically only about 60 percent of those secured by free agents with comparable skills, so the teams are getting these players at a substantial discount.

43. Nor is there any reason that you couldn't have scouts rate a player's mental tools along with his physical ones.

2. Based on statistics from StormPulse.com from the 2000 through 2011 Atlantic Basin hurricane seasons. The exact figure for the percentage of tropical depressions that became hurricanes during this period was 43 percent, while 88 percent of tropical depressions became at least tropical storms.

14. The uncertainty principle should not be confused with the observer effect, which is the idea that the act of measuring a system (such as shooting a laser beam at a particle of light) necessarily disrupts it. The two beliefs are not inherently incompatible—but the uncertainty principle is a stronger statement and is not so satisfyingly intuitive. Indeed, Heisenberg believed his uncertainty principle to be quite counterintuitive. But basically the idea is that, beyond a certain degree of resolution, at the very moment we think we're able to pin down exactly where a particle is, the particle no longer behaves as a point of matter but instead as something much different: as a wave that is moving. About the most satisfying demonstration I have seen on this is from the MIT physicist Walter Lewin: Acorvettes, "Quantum Mechanics, the Uncertainty Principle, Light Particles," YouTube, August 4, 2007. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KT7xJ0tjB4A.

35. Another type of competition is for the taxpayer's dollar. So long as the memory of Hurricane Katrina lingers—an event which, in addition to its human toll, established the precedent that the government is held accountable for its response to natural disasters—the Weather Service is probably immune from massive budget cuts. But concerns over budgets remain a constant paranoia in Camp Springs—the fear is that some bright bulb in Washington will get wind of how well the computers are doing, and decide that the human forecasters are redundant. President Obama's proposed 2013 budget for the Weather Service increased funding for weather satellites but cut it for basic operations and research.

36. Traffic estimates are per Alexa.com.

37. Although ten inches of snow sounds like a lot more precipitation than one inch of rain, they're in fact roughly equivalent, because snow molecules are much less dense. If ten inches of snow were to melt, they would typically leave about one inch of water.

41. In fact, predicting a 50 percent chance of rain is a fairly bold forecast, since it typically rains on only about 20 percent of the days at an average location in the United States.

42. At one point in advance of the 2012 presidential election, I told a group of executives I had been invited to speak with that I thought the best forecast at the time was that Barack Obama and Mitt Romney each had a 50 percent chance of winning. They demanded that I stop being so wishy-washy and give them a real answer.

43. The wet bias that Floehr identified refers to predicting precipitation more often than it occurs in reality. It does not necessarily imply that the forecasters predict too little precipitation conditional on rain occurring. In fact, Floehr has also found that the weather forecasters tend to underestimate precipitation associated with the most severe winter storms, storms like the "Snowpocalypse" in New York City in 2012.

44. Although calibration is a very important way to judge a forecast, it won't tell you everything. Over the long run, for instance, it rains about 20 percent of the days at a randomly chosen location in the United States. So you can have a well-calibrated forecast just by guessing that there is always a 20 percent chance of rain. However, this forecast has no real skill; you are just defaulting to climatology. The counterpart to calibration is what is called discrimination or resolution, which is a measure of how much you vary your forecasts from one case to the next. A forecaster who often predicts a 0 percent chance of rain, or a 100 percent chance, will score better on discrimination than one who always guesses somewhere in the middle.

Good evaluations of forecasts account for both of these properties—either individually or with statistical measures like the Brier score that attempt to account for both properties at once.

The reason I say calibration is the best measure of a forecast is pragmatic: most expert forecasters have no trouble with discrimination. In fact, they discriminate too much—that is, their forecasts are overconfident.

51. The cone of uncertainty is officially supposed to cover two-thirds of the potential landfall locations, although according to Max Mayfield, storms have remained within the cone somewhat more often than that in practice.

17. I speak here of the perception, not of the reality. In a literal sense, earthquakes are much more common than hurricanes, with several million occurring worldwide every year compared with only several dozen hurricanes. However, the vast majority of these are tiny and are undetectable unless you have a seismometer, whereas hurricanes almost always make news.

22. One obvious problem with the paper: the timing of the toads' behavior coincides very well with the foreshocks to L'Aquila—much better than with the main quake. So if they were sensitive to earthquakes, it seems more likely that they were reacting to these foreshocks, rather than "predicting" the main earthquake. Of course, seismometers were able to detect the foreshocks as well.

35. An empirically derived relationship known as Omori's Law dictates that the number of aftershocks is inversely proportional to the amount of time that has passed since the initial earthquake hit. In other words, aftershocks are more likely to occur immediately after an earthquake than days later, and more likely to occur days later than weeks after the fact.

51. My sense from speaking with Dr. Keilis-Borok is that he was acting in good faith, but forecasters do not always do so. Sometimes, especially in economic forecasting, they'll even blatantly cheat by revising their method after the fact and claiming the new model would have predicted an event that they missed in real time. There is simply no substitute for having a clear public record of a prediction made before an event occurred.

57. Specifically, the fit line in figure 5-6c is generated by a technique called Lowess regression. This technique is fine for many things and does not inherently lead to overfitting, but it requires you to set a smoothness parameter that will model anything from a very tight fit to a very loose one. In this case, obviously, I've chosen an implausibly tight fit.

58. For instance, if you apply the overfit curve to out-of-sample data—the circles from figure 5-5—it explains only about 40 percent of the variance in them. This substantial deterioration from in-sample to out-of-sample data is characteristic of an overfit model.

15. Note, however, that the economists assigned a higher chance, about 20 percent, to a negative GDP reading in each of the four financial quarters.

16. In fact, this 1-in-500 estimate is a little generous, since it applied to any GDP reading below minus 2 percent, whereas the actual GDP figure of –3.3 percent was quite a bit lower than that. Although the economists did not explicitly quantify it, it can be inferred that they would have assigned only about a 1-in-2,000 chance to a GDP reading of –3.3 percent or worse.

17. Specifically, I've looked at the forecasts made each November about the GDP growth in the following year; for instance, the November 1996 forecast of GDP growth in 1997.

The original National Football League included the Pittsburgh Steelers, Baltimore Colts (now the Indianapolis Colts), and the Cleveland Browns (the original version of which became the Baltimore Ravens). The way the indicator is usually defined, these teams are counted as belonging to the original National Football Conference even though they have since moved to the American Football Conference, the successor of the American Football League. The fact that this slightly archaic definition is used is another tip-off that the indicator is contrived.

29. For instance, explaining the amount of stock market growth through a simple regression model that uses the conference affiliation of the Super Bowl winner and a constant term as its only inputs would yield this estimate.

46. The government can do a better job of estimating incomes once it sees tax filings (Americans, as much as they might dislike taxes, are relatively honest about paying them). But income earned in January 2009 would not be reported to the IRS until April 15, 2010. Then the IRS might take a few more months to collect all the data and report it to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. So although this is highly useful information, it might become available only after a lag of eighteen months to two years—much too late to be of any use to forecasters. Nevertheless, the government continues to refine its estimates of indicators like GDP for years after the fact through what are known as benchmark revisions.

48. Specifically, the 95 percent margin of error.

49. The opposite case, happily, can sometimes arise as well. The government initially reported negative growth in the third quarter of 1981. But the data now says that the economy grew at nearly a 5 percent clip.

50. Although economists often do not give enough attention to the distinction between real time and revised data when they present their forecasts. Revisions tend to bring different economic indicators more in line with one another. But the data is much messier when it is revealed in real time; in the spring of 2012, for instance, some economic indicators (like personal income) were near-recessionary while others (like industrial production) were suggestive of strong growth. In a few years, the data from this period will probably look much cleaner and will tell a more consistent story; the personal income figures will be revised upward some or the industrial production numbers downward. But that is much too late for economists trying to make a forecast. Building a forecast model from revised data will lead you to overestimate the ease of the task of forecasting.

51. This is not just me being glib. One can plot the error made in annual GDP predictions by the Survey of Professional Forecasters against a time trend and find that there has been no overall improvement since 1968.

57. I don't publish economic forecasts, but I certainly would not claim that I was especially bullish at the time.

58. A variety of conceptually similar methods based on "leading indicators" were predicting considerable growth at the time, or at least very little chance of a recession. See Dwaine van Vuuren, "U.S. Recession—an Opposing View," Advisor Perspectives, January 3, 2012. http://www.advisorperspectives.com/newsletters12/US_Recession-An_Opposing_View.php. Although ECRI's methodology is a little opaque, it appears that their indices may have placed a lot of emphasis on commodities prices, which were declining in late 2011 after having been in something of a bubble.

61. In the November forecasts made from 1968 through 2009 of the next year's GDP in the Survey of Professional Forecasters, the root mean square error (RMSE) for an individual economist's forecast was 2.27 points, while the RMSE of the aggregate forecast was 1.92 points. Thus, averaging the forecasts reduced error by about 18 percent.

63. About the only economist I am aware of who relies solely on statistical models without applying any adjustments to them is Ray C. Fair of Yale. I looked at the accuracy of the forecasts from Fair's model, which have been published regularly since 1984. They aren't bad in some cases: the GDP and inflation forecasts from Fair's model have been roughly as good as those of the typical judgmental forecaster. However, the model's unemployment forecasts have always been very poor, and its performance has been deteriorating recently as it considerably underestimated the magnitude of the recent recession while overstating the prospects for recovery. One problem with statistical models is that they tend to perform well until one of their assumptions is violated and they encounter a new situation, in which case they may produce very inaccurate forecasts. In this case, a global financial crisis would represent a new situation to a model that had been "trained" on economic data from after World War II since none had occurred during that period.

64. For instance, if some economists were consistently better than others at forecasting GDP, you would expect those who made more accurate forecasts in even-numbered years (2000, 2002, 2004) to also make more accurate forecasts in odd-numbered ones (2001, 2003, 2005). But when I took the data from the Survey of Professional Forecasters and divided it up in this way, there was very little correlation between the two. Economists who made better forecasts in even-numbered years were only about average in odd-numbered ones, and vice versa.

10. $180 million was the projected cost of the vaccination program itself. But Democrats—sensing Ford's urgency and desperation—also managed to attach more than a billion dollars in unrelated social welfare spending to the bill.

11. Although there is certainly much less flu in the summer than the winter, part of the reason for the difference is that people are not looking for the flu in the summer and those with flulike symptoms may be diagnosed with other illnesses, I was told by Dr. Alex Ozonoff of Harvard University.

19. In 1976, about 3,000 people aged sixty-five and older would have died every day in the United States.

20. The New York Times, for instance, argued the following in an October 14 editorial:

It is conceivable that the 14 elderly people who are reported to have died soon after receiving the vaccination died of other causes. Government officials in charge of the program claim that it is all a coincidence, and point out that old people drop dead every day. The American people have even become familiar with a new statistic: Among every 100,000 people 65 to 75 years old, there will be nine or ten deaths in every 24-hour period under most normal circumstances.

Even using the official statistic, it is disconcerting that three elderly people in one clinic in Pittsburgh, all vaccinated within the same hour, should die within a few hours thereafter. This tragedy could occur by chance, but the fact remains that it is extremely improbable that such a group of deaths should take place in such a peculiar cluster by pure coincidence.

Although this logic is superficially persuasive, it suffers from a common statistical fallacy. The fallacy is that, although the odds of three particular elderly people dying on the same particular day after having been vaccinated at the same particular clinic are surely fairly long, the odds that some group of three elderly people would die at some clinic on some day are much shorter.

Assuming that about 40 percent of elderly Americans were vaccinated within the first 11 days of the program, then about 9 million people aged 65 and older would have received the vaccine in early October 1976. Assuming that there were 5,000 clinics nationwide, this would have been 164 vaccinations per clinic per day. A person aged 65 or older has about a 1-in-7,000 chance of dying on any particular day; the odds of at least three such people dying on the same day from among a group of 164 patients are indeed very long, about 480,000 to one against. However, under our assumptions, there were 55,000 opportunities for this "extremely improbable" event to occur—5,000 clinics, multiplied by 11 days. The odds of this coincidence occurring somewhere in America, therefore, were much shorter—only about 8 to 1 against.

30. Fortunately these were very mild years for the virus; had there been a major pandemic later in the 1970s, it would have been very hard to persuade people to receive vaccinations, and there could have been thousands of preventable deaths as a result.

32. Much less commonly, the flu can be carried by other mammalian species like whales and horses.

53. The version I applied here was to log-transform both the year variable and the AIDS-cases variable, then calculate the exponent via regression analysis. The 95 percent confidence interval on the exponent ran from about 2.2 to 3.7 by this method, with a most likely value of about 2.9. When applied ten years into the future, those relatively modest-seeming differences turn into an exceptionally broad range of possible outcomes.

63. I encountered a similar case when consulting for a major Hollywood movie studio in 2009. This studio, which was very sophisticated and data-driven in many ways, had a belief that a certain weekend—let's say it was the first weekend in October—was a particularly good time to release a big film even though it didn't correspond to anything especially important on the calendar. What had happened is that the studio had a film that performed unexpectedly well in that time slot one year, mostly because it was just a very good movie. The studio, however, attributed some of its success to the timing of its release. Every subsequent year, then, they would save one of their better releases for this same weekend in October and then market the hell out of it. Of course, a good and well-marketed film normally will do pretty well whenever it is released. Nevertheless, this fulfilled their prediction that early October was a good time to release a film and entrenched their belief further.

64. This calculation is based on the number of children who are classified as autistic and therefore are eligible for special education programs in public schools under the federal IDEAS Act.

65. Per NewsLibrary.com. In figure 7-4, figures for articles discussing autism are adjusted to reflect the overall volume of articles in the NewsLibrary.com database in a given year, and then indexed so as to be on the same scale as the number of public schoolchildren receiving special education programs for autism under the IDEAS Act.

89. Even if a prediction model is just a sort of thought experiment that is years away from producing useful results, it can still help us understand the scope of a problem. The Drake equation, a formula that provides a framework for predicting the number of intelligent extraterrestrial species in the galaxy, is not likely to yield highly useful and verifiable predictions in the span of our lifetimes—nor, probably, in the span of human civilization. The uncertainties are too great. Too many of its parameters are not known to within an order of magnitude; depending on which values you plug in, it can yield answers anywhere from that we are all alone in the universe to that there are billions and billions of extraterrestrial species. However, the Drake equation has nevertheless been a highly useful lens for astronomers to think about life, the universe, and everything.

12. This is based on a logistic regression analysis I conducted of all games played in the 2009–2010 NBA regular season, where the independent variable is the score margin between the home team and the away team with fourteen minutes left to play in the game, and the dependent variable is whether or not the home team ultimately won. The regression model yields a value of .056 when the scoring margin is –16; that is, the home team has a 5.6 percent chance of victory when trailing by sixteen points, which translates into odds 17-to-1 against. I round down slightly to 15 to 1 because a team trailing by sixteen points at home will usually be inferior to its opponent, whereas the Lakers and Blazers were more evenly matched.

13. Voulgaris's odds of winning his bet at the start of the evening were about 50 percent: a 60 percent chance that the Lakers beat the Blazers in Game 7 multiplied by what I've estimated to be an 83 percent chance that the Lakers would beat the Pacers if advancing to the final. By that point in the game, the Lakers' odds of winning the Championship were down to about 5 percent: a 6 percent chance of coming back to beat the Blazers, multiplied by an 83 percent chance of beating the Pacers.

15. Most sports leagues hold their drafts in reverse order of finish: the team with the worst record is the first to pick. In the NBA, a sport where a single superstar talent can make an exceptional amount of difference, the league holds a draft lottery so as to discourage teams from tanking their games at the end of the season to improve their drafting position. Nevertheless, the worse a team does, the more Ping-Pong balls it gets in the lottery, and so teams will often play something other than their best basketball in these scenarios.

16. This asymmetry would not exist to the same extent if basketball teams were more focused on individual defensive statistics. But offense is relatively easy to measure, and defense is relatively hard; some teams don't even try to measure individual defensive performance at all. A player who scores a basket will therefore gain more market value than the man defending will lose by conceding one.

27. Some Christians regard Bayesian probability as more compatible with their worldview. Under Bayes's theorem, if you assign a 100 percent prior probability to the hypothesis that a Christian God exists, then no amount of worldly evidence will shake you from that conviction. It is plausible that Bayes was aware of this property; in introducing Bayes's essay, Richard Price mentioned that he thought Bayes's theorem helped to confirm "the existence of the Diety."

23. Trading a bishop for a knight early in the game, as Deep Blue threatened to do, may not be a good trade because bishops are more valuable when a player still has both of them on the board. If you have just one bishop, your opponent can move with relative impunity on the half of the squares that the remaining bishop can't physically cover. In other words, you'd rather have one knight and both bishops than two knights and one bishop.

36. Which was the correct move is still debated. The other computers of the day—less advanced than Deep Blue—found Qb6, the queen advancement, to be the right play, and by a somewhat large margin. But the very fact that Deep Blue had deviated from the computer play had been what distinguished its move. When I set up the position on a contemporary computer engine called Rybka, it also picked Qb6, but found the position to be much closer, the difference amounting to not more than about three-tenths of a pawn worth of strength. The difference is small enough that it's easy to imagine Deep Blue, a somewhat idiosyncratic engine that was specifically tailored to match up with Kasparov, picking the alternative line.

CHAPTER 10. THE POKER BUBBLE

1. "Chris Moneymaker Ranking History" in The Mob Poker Database, thehendonmob.com. http://pokerdb.thehendonmob.com/player_graphs/chris_moneymaker_18826.

2. I first played in one of the smaller events at the World Series of Poker in 2005, although I did not participate in the $10,000 main event of the tournament until 2009.

3. The catch was that you had to play a certain number of hands at the site before you could cash out any winnings.

4. The example that follows is idealized, in the sense that we will be applying a relatively formal and rigorous mathematical process to consider a fairly typical poker hand, alongside the more impressionistic view that a player might have at the table. In a real poker game, players must make decisions much more quickly, both for reasons of etiquette and because spending too much time contemplating a hand would itself reveal information to the opponents. However, the thought process described here is what all poker players are striving for, whether they realize it or not. The question is who can come to the closest approximation of it under the pressures that a real game represents.

5. If the opponent raised with a middling hand, such as a pair of nines on the river, he would essentially be doing so as a bluff since he wouldn't expect us to call with a weaker hand.

17. My analysis was limited to players who played in games featuring a big blind of $2 or higher; this is about the cheapest increment at which enough money could potentially be made from the game to sustain the existence of some professional players.

18. Specifically, I split the sample data into even- and odd-numbered months; if a player is truly skilled, he should be winning in the even-numbered months as well as the odd-numbered ones. I then applied a regression analysis to predict a player's win rate (measured as big blinds won per one hundred hands) from one half of the sample to the other; the results of the regression are taken to be tantamount to the player's long term success rate. The variables in the regression were a player's win rate, multiplied by the natural logarithm of the number of hands who he played, along with a variable indicating how many hands he played of the ones he was dealt. Players who were too tight or too loose were considerably less likely to replicate their success from one period to the next, holding other factors equal—in fact, this was often a better predictor of a player's out-of-sample win rate than the past win rate itself, unless he had played a very large number of hands.

19. Online poker tables typically consisted of ten seats; those in bricks-and-mortar casinos often contain nine seats instead.

20. In the online poker data, the rake was equivalent to about $57 per one hundred hands, according to my estimate. The figure would potentially be quite similar at a bricks-and-mortar casino. The Bellagio, for instance, usually charges players a fee of $6 per half hour. To get in one hundred hands of no-limit poker in a casino environment, a player would typically need to spend about four hours at the table (it is a fairly slow game). That means she'd need to pay the time charge eight times, for $48 total. Add in the customary $1 tip to the dealer when she wins a hand, and you get to roughly the same $57 figure. No adjustment was made for the benefits—and the hidden costs—of the free cocktails in Las Vegas.

23. Games tended to be a bit fishier in the winter, when more people were staying indoors and were logged on to their computers, and in the summer when the World Series of Poker was being played, than they were in the spring or the fall.

28. Based on a minimum of fifty at-bats for the player in both April and May.

29. Contrast this with a sport like tennis, where the structure of the game is such that even modest differences in skill level manifest themselves very quickly. The very best players in the world, like Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic, win only about 55 percent of the points they play—barely more than half. However, hundreds of points are played over the course of a single match, while baseball players might get just four or five at-bats. It would be silly to conclude that Nadal is better at tennis than Josh Hamilton is at baseball. But Nadal almost always wins while Hamilton has plenty of nights when he goes 0-for-4. In tennis, you reach the long run much more quickly.

30. This estimate is based on my own history, as well as the statistics from other limit hold 'em players in my databases.

31. Chen and Ankenman, "The Mathematics of Poker;" pp. 40–43.

32. Although this calculation is made more complicated by the fact that the distribution of long-term win rates among poker players almost certainly does not follow a bell curve (normal distribution). Instead, per our application of the Pareto principle of prediction, it is left-skewed, with a "fat tail" of losing players.

7. Markets provide us with valuable information whether or not we participate in them directly. An economist might hate bananas, refusing to buy bananas at the supermarket at any price, but she still might be interested in knowing what they cost, to help her calculate the inflation rate. Or an orchard might be interested to know what the price was to decide whether it should plant more banana trees.

Economists call this property "price discovery," and it's one of the key advantages of a free-market economy; the common price for a good or service in the market provides valuable information about the supply and demand for it, and the price can rise or fall in response. If prices are set by a central authority instead, it's much more cumbersome to determine which goods should be produced.

13. Intrade has suffered from some systematic—and perhaps predictable—biases. In particular, research by Wolfers and others has shown it suffers from something called favorite-longshot bias, which means that bettors tend to overprice low-probability events. For instance, events that Intrade might suggest had a 1 in 10 chance of occurring in fact occur only 1 in 20 times over the long run, and events that the market implied had a 1 in 30 chance of occurring might in fact happen just 1 time in 100. Correcting for this bias was enough for Intrade to outperform FiveThirtyEight in 2008, according to Rothschild's paper, while FiveThirtyEight was quite a bit better without this adjustment.

17. Several models of the 2010 U.S. House elections, for instance, relied on the Gallup poll and the Gallup poll alone. Although Gallup is usually a very good polling firm, its surveys were way off that year and implied a much larger gain for the Republicans than they actually achieved—perhaps 80 or 90 seats rather than the 63 they actually gained. However, taking the polling average would have gotten you quite close to the right result.

21. I haven't actually bet on Intrade, as I would consider it a conflict of interest.

22. More specifically, my hope (or belief) is that my subjective probability estimates (my Bayesian priors) might be better than Intrade's on average. I consider it less likely that this would be true of the forecast models that we run, since those models make certain simplifying assumptions and since it is important to think carefully about whether your model is flawed or whether the consensus is flawed when there is a divergence between them. (More often than not, the model is flawed.) If you follow the FiveThirtyEight blog, you may sometimes see me writing that you should bet against the FiveThirtyEight model for this reason.

38. Specifically, a linear regression of the sign of that day's stock price (1 indicating a positive movement and –1 indicating a negative movement) on the previous day's stock price. The trend is also highly statistically significant if you take a regression of the percentage change in the stock price on the previous day's percentage change. Note, however, that standard forms of regression analysis assume that errors are normally distributed, whereas the stock market does not obey a normal distribution. Economists like Fama think this is a problem when applying standard statistical tests to analyze patterns in stock prices.

CASES IN WHICH THE S&P 500 INCREASED BY 90 PERCENT OVER A FIVE-YEAR PERIOD

Year(s)

Crash?

Description

1881–83

No

Although stocks lost 36 percent of their nominal value between June 1881 and January 1885, much of this is accounted for by the severe deflation that was gripping the country at the time. This should probably not be considered a crash, although returns were below-average even on an inflation-adjusted basis.

1901

Yes

Panic of 1901. Initially confined to a relatively narrow industry, railroad stocks, which happened to be very popular with small investors, the downturn eventually spread to the broader market with the S&P 500 losing more than a quarter of its value from 1901 to 1903.

1925–30

Yes

Great Depression. Stock prices declined by almost 80 percent over a three-year period from 1929–1932 amid the worst financial crisis in history.

1937

Yes

Recession of 1937–38. Stocks lost more than 40 percent of their value over a 14-month period as the economy went into a severe double-dip recession.

1954–59

No

The early 1950s were an extremely good time to buy stocks as investors benefited from America's postwar prosperity boom. Toward the end of the 1950s was somewhat less favorable, as stock prices were choppy throughout the 1960s.

1986–87

Yes

Black Monday came on October 19, 1987, with the Dow declining by almost 23 percent in a single day. An investor who persevered through the period would have seen very good returns in the 1990s.

1989

No

An investor buying in 1989 would have experienced the robust returns of the 1990s without the trauma of Black Monday. A good time to buy stocks.

1997–2000

Yes

Dot-com crash. Someone buying the S&P 500 at the top of the market in August 2000 and selling it at the bottom in February 2003 would have lost almost half his money. An investor with a portfolio rich in technology stocks would have done even worse.

45. The original title of Dow 100,000 was apparently the more modest Dow 30,000 before its publisher realized that it was going to be one-upped. I infer this because the original description of the book at Amazon.com refers to it as "Dow 30,000," emphasizing its prediction that the Dow would increase to 30,000 by 2010. The book also predicted that the Dow would rise to 100,000 by 2020, giving it its new title. See http://www.amazon.com/Dow-100-000-Fact-Fiction/dp/0735201374 retrieved November 25, 2011.

46. By "real return," I refer to the share price plus dividends but less inflation. I assume that dividends are automatically re-invested in the stock index rather than held.

48. Charts like those in figure 11-7 look to be extremely rich with data, but they are somewhat deceptive. They include a data point to represent every year of stock-market returns: one of the circles in the chart, for instance, represents how stocks behaved in the twenty years between 1960 and 1980. Another circle represents how they behaved from 1961 to 1981. The problem is that those periods overlap with one another and therefore are double-counting the same data. If we're looking at how stock prices perform in twenty years at a time, we don't really have that much data to work with. Shiller's P/E ratio can first be calculated in 1881. Start in 1881 and count upward twenty years at a time . . . you get to 1901, 1921, 1941, 1961, 1981, and 2001. Then you run out of time after just six data points.

49. You should, of course, make as large a trade as you can if you are certain about what the stock is going to do.

64. There is also some evidence that the analysts know privately when a stock is a loser much sooner than they are willing to say publicly, and will tip their firm's investment clients to this before they inform the general public.

69. Individual investors, because they tend to make smaller trades, account for an even smaller fraction of the trading that takes place. One recent study (Alicia Davis Evans, "A Requiem for the Retail Investor?" Virginia Law Review, May 14, 2009. http://www.virginialawreview.org/content/pdfs/95/1105.pdf) holds that individual investors account for just 2 percent of market volume on the New York Stock Exchange.

70. Say that a trader has the opportunity to bet $1 million of his firm's capital on a short position in the market. He figures there is a 55 percent chance the market will crash over the next year and a 45 percent chance that it will improve. This is a pretty good bet. If the analyst has calculated the odds right, the expected return from it is $100,000.

But the incentives may look nothing like this for the trader himself. There is a high probability that he will be fired if he gets the bet wrong. Short-sellers aren't popular on Wall Street, especially when they're underperforming their peers. He may benefit to some extent if he gets the bet right, but not enough to outweigh this. Better to wait until the crash is unavoidable and all traders fall down together.

The S&P 500 is almost certainly preferable for these purposes to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, both because it includes a much broader and more diversified array of stocks and because it is weighted according to the market capitalization of each stock rather than their prices, meaning that it does a much better job of replicating the portfolio of the average investor.

36. One problem this introduces is that some of the rules verge on being self-contradictory. For instance, one of Armstrong's principles holds that forecasters should "use all important variables" while another touts the virtue of simplicity in forecasting methods. Indeed, the trade-off between parsimony and comprehensiveness when building a forecast model is an important dilemma. I'm less certain that much is accomplished by attempting to boil it down to a series of conflicting mandates rather than thinking about the problem more holistically. It also seems unlikely to me, given the number of rules that Armstrong suggests, that very many forecasts of any kind would receive a high grade according to his forecast audit.

63. GISS stands for the Goddard Institute of Space Studies. Some scientists express a preference for the NASA/GISS record because it does a better job of accounting for the Arctic and a few other areas where temperature stations are sparse. This is potentially important because there has been more warming in the Arctic than in any other part of the globe.

67. Note that the two satellite records use some of the same underlying data.

68. Some analyses have mistakenly used the satellite temperature records for the upper atmosphere rather than the lower atmosphere. The upper atmosphere is not necessarily predicted to warm—and in fact, may actually cool—under the greenhouse effect.

69. If the satellite technique is slightly less precise since it relies on inference, it does provide some advantages over measuring temperatures from thermometer readings, as the traditional sources do. In particular, these measurements are not subject to the so-called "heat island effect," which is the tendency of downtown business centers to show higher temperatures because of the materials used in tall buildings, which often reflect heat and thereby leave the surrounding areas somewhat warmer. Studies suggest that the impact of the heat-island effect is small, and the station-based temperature records make efforts to correct for it. Nevertheless, having the satellite measurements in addition to station-based temperature measurements provides for some redundancy.

70. For instance, one can adjust the temperature records to the same scale by looking at the years in which they overlapped with one another.

71. Their correlations (where 1 represents an exact match and 0 represents no relationship at all) are all .90 or higher.

75. I use the meteorological definition of summer—the calendar months of June, July, and August—rather than the astronomical definition in which summer does not begin until about June 21.

77. The charts that accompanied the IPCC report showed a roughly linear increase in temperature. Thus, although we know that temperatures are subject to substantial yearly fluctuations, the IPCC forecast implied how much they are supposed to increase on average: by between 0.02°C and 0.05°C per year.

It refers to a "best estimate" of a 2°C increase in global mean surface temperatures in the 110 years between 1990 and 2100, which works out to approximately 1.8°C per 100 years. The note also expresses a range of projections between 0.9°C and 2.7°C in warming per century. So, even the high end of the IPCC's 1995 temperature range posited a (slightly) lower rate of warming than its best estimate in 1990. http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/climate-changes-1995/ipcc-2nd-assessment/2nd-assessment-en.pdf.

101. Armstrong was willing to acknowledge there was some chance his no-change forecast would go badly in the near term. He told me that he figured the chances of winning the bet with Gore—which looked at temperature increases over the next decade rather than the next century—were about 70 percent.

102. This estimate is based on the error term on the coefficient associated with temperature increase in the regression model. It assumes that the exact amount of carbon dioxide is known and that CO2 will continue to increase at the same annual rate that it did between 2002 and 2011. In practice, the model underestimates the error slightly—and therefore somewhat underestimates the chance of a cooling decade—because the exact amount of CO2 is an unknown, as well as because of any specification uncertainty in the model.

33. Some of this resulted because of the banalities of the national security system; bureaucracy might be thought of as the opposite of imagination. In Pearl Harbor, some of the signals of the impeding Japanese attack were detected by the Army and others by the Navy; some were detected in Washington and others in Hawaii. However, the information was not necessarily shared, so no one decision maker had much insight. As Schelling writes in Wohlstetter's book:

Surprise, when it happens to a government, is likely to be a complicated, diffuse, bureaucratic thing. It includes neglect of responsibility but also responsibility so poorly defined . . . that action gets lost. It includes gaps in intelligence, but also intelligence that, like a string of pearls too precious to wear, is too sensitive to give to those who need it. It includes the alarm that fails to work, but also the alarm that has gone off so often it has been disconnected. . . . It includes the contingencies that occur to no one, but also those that everyone assumes someone else is taking care of.

Likewise, in advance of September 11, some key pieces of information were held by the FBI and some by the CIA, some by the State Department and some by the Department of Defense. Rumsfeld told me that many of George Tenet's revelations, for instance, he learned of for the first time only after reading Tenet's book. Meanwhile, the Bush administration had just taken over from the Clinton administration and there were the usual political chores to worry about; Rumsfeld, for instance, spent much of his first nine months in office trying to fend off budget cuts.

47. There is one slight "trick" that I've used here, and which Clauset also uses in his published work. Terror attacks producing very small numbers of fatalities—in this case, under five deaths—do not fit the data quite as cleanly and are eliminated from the analysis. Ordinarily, you would not want to do something like this; it's bad practice to throw out data unless you have a very good reason to do so. But in this case, it does not make much practical difference, since as numerous as small terror attacks are, they are responsible for a very small fraction of the death toll. Moreover, there may be modest biases in the coverage of the database—larger incidents are almost certain to be included, whereas those that kill just one or two people might not be. And there is some debate about whether terrorists themselves should be included in the death toll in the event of suicide attacks—RAND does include them—which has relatively more effect when the overall number of casualties is small.

48. In this case, an attack on the "scale of 9/11" refers to one that kills at least 2,749 people—the death toll at the World Trade Center site. The overall death toll on 9/11 was slightly higher—close to 3,000 people—but the RAND database and most others classify the attacks on the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and United Flight 93 as having been separate (although related) attacks. This does not make much difference, however: an attack killing at least 3,000 people would be expected to occur about once every 44 years, rather than once every 41.

50. In a 2012 paper that Clauset sent to me and which he submitted to the Annals of Applied Statistics, he went through a similar calculation with a more refined technique and put the risk of a 9/11-scale attack at between 11 percent and 35 percent in the 33 years between 1968 and 2001. This implies a slightly lower but still very tangible risk of a 9/11-scale attack, on the order of once per 130 years.

13. This is just a personal reflection—not an empirical observation—but I am being somewhat literal about this point. When I was working on this book and came across a thorny problem that I couldn't quite resolve, I found it much more productive to walk around, subjecting my brain to random inputs, than to stare at my computer screen or sit in a coffee shop. One of the advantages of living in New York is that it offers 24/7 access to the spontaneous behavior of eight million human beings who might jog your mind or your memory.

I searched for cases in which either the word "predictable" or "unpredictable" appeared in the journal article at least once (but not both words in the same article), breaking down the results by the decade of publication. The percentages reflected in figure C-2 represent the number of uses of "predictable" and "unpredictable," respectively, relative to their total number.

* This property is true of National Weather Service forecasts—but not of your local TV meteorologist. Their incentive may be to exaggerate the probability of rain for the sake of better ratings. More about this in chapter 4.

* Tape is also a term of art in the ratings industry, referring to new and fresh data on individual mortgages.

* In 2005, the average Moody's employee made $185,000, compared with the $520,000 received by the average Goldman Sachs employee that same year.

* These types of risks might fall into the category "unknown knowns."

* And probably also a stupid bet if you've ever seen the Redskins play.

* Most major cable providers keep Fox News and MSNBC at least a couple of channels apart in their lineups.

* Of the series of revolutions in the Eastern bloc in 1989, only the one in Romania entailed substantial bloodshed.

* FiveThirtyEight's name refers to the number of votes in the Electoral College (538).

* The classic form of media bias is "rooting for the story"—hoping for a more dramatic outcome that might increase newspaper sales.

* Not surprisingly, no Democrats told me this after the 2010 campaign—when our models consistently showed them losing badly.

* The Red Sox's truly epic collapse—when they lost sixteen of their last twenty-one games and missed the playoffs after seeming almost certain to qualify for them—would come two years later in 2011.

* I traded Pedroia away in one of my fantasy leagues.

* James coined the term sabermetrics to describe the systematic study of baseball, especially through statistics. The term is derived from the acronym SABR, for Society of American Baseball Research, which was instrumental in the popularization of James's work.

* Contrast this with football, in which a great offensive line can make an All-Pro out of a mediocre running back, or basketball, in which the synergy between a point guard and a power forward can make them more than the sum of their parts.

* Although Bill Pecota hit just .249 for his career overall, he hit .303 in games against the Tigers.

* That works out to about $1.9 million per team per season.

* In the model that I use to forecast the outcome of U.S. House elections, for instance, I combine quantitative information like polls with the qualitative ratings from experts like the Cook Political Report. If Cook says a particular race is a toss-up, I code that as a 0. If they put the race in the Lean Democrat category, I code that as a +1, and so forth. Combining this information produces a better forecast than either type of information taken alone.

* Loft bears some physical resemblance to Rainn Wilson, the actor who plays Schrute.

* As we will see in chapter 8, it is not so easy to characterize Laplace along this spectrum. He was an eclectic thinker and was instrumental in the development of probability theory, motivated in part by his conviction that human beings were unlikely to live up to the perfection he saw in nature.

* That was not the Weather Service's final move. In 1940, with an eye toward assisting the Civil Aeronautics Administration and the bourgeoning industry of manned flight, the Congress migrated it to the Department of Commerce, where it resides today.

* Unfortunately, although forecasters have gotten much better at figuring out where a hurricane will hit, they haven't really gotten any better at predicting how powerful it will be when it does. The reason is that the forces that govern the intensity of a storm occur at much smaller scales than the ones that determine its track. This means they require a much finer lattice, and even the Bluefire is not yet up to the task.

* A poorly calibrated forecast can sometimes be detected more quickly. If you said there was a 100 percent chance of an outcome occurring and it didn't, or a 0 percent chance and it did, we do not need any more data to conclude that your forecast was wrong.

* News accounts often refer to the Richter scale, named after the Caltech seismologist Charles Richter. In fact, a different and more accurate scale—the moment magnitude scale, developed at Caltech in the late 1970s—is in more common use among seismologists today. The moment magnitude scale is designed to be comparable to the Richter scale—both scales are logarithmic, and a magnitude 8.0 earthquake is a very serious one under either definition. But they are not calculated in quite the same way. The earthquake magnitudes described in this chapter generally refer to the moment magnitude scale.

* Seismologists use the term "earthquake swarm" to refer to a series of small earthquakes.

* The Japanese word kamikaze originally meant "divine wind," referring to typhoons in 1274 and 1281 that had helped to disperse a Mongol invasion.

* The Haitian earthquake of 2010 was an exception to the pattern geographically, but not in how poverty and lax building standards contribute to immense death and destruction.

* Recall that the magnitude scale is already logarithmic, so this is what's technically known as a double-logarithmic plot.

* If you feed a computer a string of coin tosses (a random mix of 1's and 0's representing heads and tails), and then test out statistical parameters to try to fit a pattern-matching model, eventually it will think it can call 60 percent or 70 percent or (if you include enough variables) 100 percent of coin flips correctly. All this is artificial, of course; over the long run, it will call exactly 50 percent of coin flips correctly, no more and no less.

* The political scientist Roger Pielke Jr., who was brought in to consult on the disaster, alerted me to this story.

* The 95 percent prediction interval—the standard that political polls use—is even larger: 9.1 percentage points, equivalent to a margin of error of plus or minus 4.6 points.

* The substantive variables fall into about a dozen major categories: growth (as measured by GDP and its components), jobs, inflation, interest rates, wages and income, consumer confidence, industrial production, sales and consumer spending, asset prices (like stocks and homes), commodity prices (like oil futures), and measures of fiscal policy and government spending. As you can see, this already gives you plenty to work with, so there is little need to resort to four hundred variables.

* This may be in part because the economic data from before World War II is quite incomplete.

* The root-mean squared error for the forecasts in these years was 1.1 points of GDP, versus 2.3 points for the years 1968–85.

* In contrast, consider India, where much of the population is either vegetarian or Muslim—two groups that do not consume any pork. (Even in the United States or Great Britain, you're unlikely to find pork on the menu at an authentic Indian restaurant.) Although India meets the other two conditions, it has very rarely been the source for the flu.

* If you had assumed that the global population would continue to grow at a rate of 2.1 percent per year, the rate that it did in 1968 when Ehrlich published his book, global population would project to almost nine billion by 2012, considerably above its actual figure of seven billion.

* New York, for instance, does not allow you to file a police report online, while San Francisco does, as I found out when my rental car was broken into there in a reporting trip for this book. San Francisco is doing a better job of helping citizens and visitors to report and prevent crimes. But perversely, this makes its reported crime rate higher.

* A vaccine typically contains a small and very weak microorganism that is derived from the bug that it is hoping to prevent—just enough for you to develop some immunity to it without becoming sick.

* The title of this chapter is inspired by a line from the poem "The Road to Wisdom," by the Danish mathematician Piet Hein: "to err and err and err again, but less and less and less."

* This assumes that the Lakers would beat the Indiana Pacers, the Eastern Conference champions, in the NBA Finals, against whom they'd be heavily favored. Voulgaris could have hedged his bet again if he wanted to mitigate that slim risk.

* The number of possible combinations is calculated as 45,000 times 44,999 divided by two, which is 1,012,477,500.

* One difference is that the negative findings are probably kept in a file drawer rather than being published (about 90 percent of the papers published in academic journals today document positive findings rather than negative ones). However, that does not mask the problem of false positives in the findings that do make it to publication.

* Or more properly, the odds you would set as a betting line so as to be indifferent between either side of the bet. Most Bayesians do require that priors avoid what is called a Dutch book, where the odds are incoherent. If you establish a set of prior probabilities on each of the thirty teams winning the NBA championship, they have to add up to 100 percent exactly since this represents an exhaustive set of possibilities.

* It has been found that because 95 percent confidence in a statistical test is Fisher's traditional dividing line between "signficiant" and "insignificant," researchers are much more likely to report findings that statistical tests classify as 95.1 percent certain than those they classify as 94.9 percent certain—a practice that seems more superstitious than scientific.

* Although bear in mind that one of the conclusions of this book is that people are overconfident; we probably have too many beliefs that tend toward the 0 percent or 100 percent end of the spectrum.

* And that they don't hold priors that they believe to be exactly 100 percent true or exactly 0 percent true; these will not and cannot change under Bayes's theorem.

* Winning percentage, as I use the term here, refers to the number of points that each side scores out of the possible total, where one point is awarded for winning a game and half a point is awarded for a draw. If you play ten games, winning five, drawing three, and losing two, you have a winning percentage of 65 percent.

* Rooks are typically evaluated by computers (and humans) as being about 60 percent more valuable than bishops, other things being equal.

* Promotion in chess refers to what happens when a pawn reaches the opponent's eighth rank. It can be exchanged for a bishop, knight, rook or (as is almost always most advantageous) a second queen.

* In practice, this position is not winning, because chess employs a rule that automatically calls the game a draw if no pieces have been captured and no pawns have been advanced after fifty consecutive moves.

* A more recent analysis of the second game, conducted in 2007 with a computer that surpasses both Fritz and Deep Blue in skill, suggests that Kasparov may not have been able to draw the position if Deep Blue had played the exact right sequence of moves. Still, Kasparov may well have drawn the game had he played it out in 1997.

* Skynet was the evil computer in the Terminator series. It gets very mad when you confuse it with HAL 9000.

* Moneymaker has made "only" about $110,000 per year from poker tournaments since his World Series win, before accounting for his substantial entry fees into tournaments.

* The $5 and $10 increments refer to the obligatory bets, called blind bets, that rotate around the table and force the action. No-limit refers to the fact that players may bet any amount up to the amount sitting in front of them in chips, on any betting round. However, the betting in a no-limit hold 'em game is constrained by the amount that the lesser of the two players has before the hand begins. If you start the hand with $500 in chips and are playing against Bill Gates who has $500,000,000, the most you are putting at risk is $500; any bets that Gates makes above that amount are considered void. So he can't force you to round up an additional $499,999,500 in chips just so that you might call his bluff.

* Occasionally a player might call rather than raise with a hand like a pair of aces for purposes of deception.

* Ivey's hand was A 2 while Dwan's was 7 6. The flop was J 3 5 and the turn was the 4, making Ivey a 5-high straight and Dwan a 7-high straight.

* Whereas the very best players deliberately insert some randomness into their play to make it harder to read their hands, the worst ones may play randomly because they don't know what the right play is to begin with.

* My analysis of the players was weighted by the number of hands that each player was dealt. In poker, a very large proportion of the total hands are dealt to a very small percentage of the total players, those who play the game every day rather than once every month or every year. In fact, the online poker environment is a hyperbolized version of the 80-20 rule: about 80 percent of the hands in the database were dealt to just 2 percent of the total players. Since you are much more likely to encounter a player from the 2 percent of prolific players than if you selected at random from all players who had played even one hand, the analysis would create an unrealistic impression of the economy of a poker table if not conducted in this way.

* Online players often also "multitable," meaning play in more than one game at once, which further multiplies their win rate. This is physically impossible (or at least disallowed) in a brick-and-mortar casino.

* While computer programs like Billings's have become quite good at limit hold 'em, they are not yet very good at the more strategically challenging game of no-limit hold 'em.

* Meditation helps people achieve this, in part, by encouraging focus on posture and breathing—things that are within our control but which we normally take for granted.

* Some of it also represents market making: certain investment firms, like a well-stocked 7-Eleven, hold a lot of inventory and can be counted on to be open for business when no one else is, hoping to make a few pennies at a time for their trouble.

* One could imagine that a small fudge factor might be allowed if our probability estimates were close but not exactly the same, since there is some inconvenience associated with betting.

* I met Santorum for my New York Times story on the Iowa vote count dispute after the initial tally had shown Romney ahead. Santorum remembered my bet and jokingly asserted that the bet was my motivation for tracking him down. It may have provided some additional incentive.

* Because it is so cheap to bet on Intrade, but it is receiving an increasing amount of media attention and can generate more favorable press coverage for a campaign, it could conceivably be in the interest of a candidate or a "super PAC" to buy shares as a cheap form of advertising.

* This experiment re-creates a famous experiment by the Princeton economist Burton Malkiel, who had his class flip coins to generate these random charts, and then showed them to a technical analyst who insisted that he buy the stocks immediately.

* In rock-paper-scissors, the equilibrium strategy is to pick at random between rock, paper, and scissors. This strategy ensures that, over the long run, you cannot possibly lose. Unfortunately, it also ensures that you cannot possibly win. No matter how long you play, the expected return from the strategy is zero.

If you think your opponent is behaving predictably, of course, you can deviate from this strategy and try to outguess him. Perhaps like Bart Simpson, your opponent always plays rock. In this case, you should always play paper. The catch is that in trying to out-guess your opponent, your own strategy will become predictable. Once Bart realizes that you're always playing paper, he can beat you anytime he wants by switching to scissors.

Much technical trading in the stock market probably obeys this sort of cat-and-mouse dynamic, with technical traders simply trying to outguess other technical traders. However, the patterns they are trading on can dissipate or even reverse themselves once other investors become aware of them. The result is a lot of money being passed around from trader to trader, but the pile slowly growing smaller as it is eaten away by transaction costs.

* Although this is technologically feasible, it will not make your flight attendant happy.

* Take, for instance, the oft-cited statistic that the stock market returns 7 percent annually after dividends and inflation. This is just a historical average. Reliable stock market data only goes back 120 years or so—not all that much data if you really want to know about the long run. Statistical tests suggest that the true long-run return—what we might expect over the next 120 years—could be anywhere from 3 percent to 10 percent instead of 7 percent. The answer to what economists call the "equity premium puzzle"—why stocks have returned so much more money than bonds in a way that is disproportionate to the risks they entail—may simply be that the returns stocks achieved in the twentieth century were anomalous, and the true long-run return is not as high as 7 percent.

* This is no surprise given how poor most of us—including most of us who invest for a living—are at estimating probabilities. The few who are good at it have the potential to clean up. However, most options traders receive a poor return, and it is a very risky activity on the whole.

* As Nassim Nicholas Taleb detailed in The Black Swan and as Fama also discussed in his thesis, the movement of stock prices does not follow a gentle bell-curve distribution. Instead, stock-price movements are characterized by very occasional but very large swings up or down. The distribution of stock-market crashes can also be modeled fairly well by a power-law distribution, which is the same function that governs the frequency of earthquakes.

* Senator Tim Wirth of Colorado later told PBS's Frontline that he and his colleagues had deliberately opened the windows in the hearing room the previous evening to prevent the air-conditioning from functioning effectively.

* As I discuss in chapter 6, the concept of "statistical significance" is very often problematic in practice. But to my knowledge there does not exist a community of "obesity skeptics" who cite statistics like these to justify a diet of Big Macs and Fritos.

* In this sense, the term climate change may be inferior to the more specific term global warming. Climate change creates the impression that any potential change in our environment—warming or cooling, more precipitation or less—is potentially consistent with the theory. In fact, some of these phenomena (like cooler temperatures) would contradict the predictions made by the theory under most circumstances.

* There is an alternative-energy lobby as well, although it is quite a bit smaller, spending about $30 million per year.

* Armstrong is an expert at the Heartland Institute, a conservative think tank that has opposed efforts to curb greenhouse emissions.

* One such petition, which was claimed to have been signed by 15,000 scientists, later turned up names like Geri Halliwell, a.k.a. Ginger Spice of the Spice Girls, who had apparently given up her career as a pop star to pursue a degree in microbiology.

* I use the term complexity in its plain-English meaning in this chapter meaning that complex is largely synonymous with complicated. There is also a particular scientific domain called complexity theory, which some scientists distinguish from chaos theory. We explore these very interesting ideas in chapter 5.

* If you scale back their warming estimates to reflect the smaller-than-assumed rate of CO2 increase, you wind up with a revised projection of 1.4 °C to 3.6 °C in warming per century. The actual rate of increase, a pace of 1.5 °C per century since the report was published, falls within this range, albeit barely.

* It may be hard to objectively measure scientific progress, but in the related realm of technology, the number of patents issued continues to increase at roughly exponential rates and is about double now what it was just a decade ago.

* Although the term was not widely used at the time, the sorts of threats that planners were worried about might be thought of more along the lines of "terrorism" today.

* I chose the title of this book before I came across Wohlstetter's, but she pioneered the use of the metaphor fifty years ago.

* A conspiracy theory might be thought of as the laziest form of signal analysis. As the Harvard professor H. L. "Skip" Gates says, "Conspiracy theories are an irresistible labor-saving device in the face of complexity."

* Hawaii did not become a state until 1959.

* You may even decide that the best estimate is that something is essentially random: you are certain that you are uncertain!

* United 93 departed Newark Airport at 8:42 A.M., forty-one minutes after its scheduled departure time, hitting its cruising altitude just as the second plane hit the South Tower of the World Trade Center.

* The largest terror attack in any country had been the arson of the Cinema Rex theater in Abadan, Iran, in 1978, which killed 422.

* Note that "the basis on which I'd make bets" is essentially a Bayesian prior possibility.

* They were stopped by Jack Bauer, of course.

*You may even want to hone your skills in fields like sports, which offer rich data sets and rich opportunities for testing your techniques. The NCAA bracket pool may be less of a diversion than you realize, especially if you take it seriously.

*A sign that you're spending too much time in model land is if you start to use the word "prediction" to refer to how your model fits the past data. As I describe in chapter 5, it is very easy to overfit a model, thinking you have captured the signal when you're just describing the noise. Sticking to the simple, commonsense definition of a prediction as something that applies strictly to a future event may reduce the risk of these errors.
