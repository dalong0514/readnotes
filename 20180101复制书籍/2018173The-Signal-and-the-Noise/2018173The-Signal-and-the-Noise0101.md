## 0101A CATASTROPHIC FAILURE OF PREDICTION

It was October 23, 2008. The stock market was in free fall, having plummeted almost 30 percent over the previous five weeks. Once-esteemed companies like Lehman Brothers had gone bankrupt. Credit markets had all but ceased to function. Houses in Las Vegas had lost 40 percent of their value.1 Unemployment was skyrocketing. Hundreds of billions of dollars had been committed to failing financial firms. Confidence in government was the lowest that pollsters had ever measured.2 The presidential election was less than two weeks away.

Congress, normally dormant so close to an election, was abuzz with activity. The bailout bills it had passed were sure to be unpopular3 and it needed to create every impression that the wrongdoers would be punished. The House Oversight Committee had called the heads of the three major credit-rating agencies, Standard & Poor's (S&P), Moody's, and Fitch Ratings, to testify before them. The ratings agencies were charged with assessing the likelihood that trillions of dollars in mortgage-backed securities would go into default. To put it mildly, it appeared they had blown the call.

The Worst Prediction of a Sorry Lot

The crisis of the late 2000s is often thought of as a failure of our political and financial institutions. It was obviously an economic failure of massive proportions. By 2011, four years after the Great Recession officially began, the American economy was still almost $800 billion below its productive potential.4

I am convinced, however, that the best way to view the financial crisis is as a failure of judgment—a catastrophic failure of prediction. These predictive failures were widespread, occurring at virtually every stage during, before, and after the crisis and involving everyone from the mortgage brokers to the White House.

The most calamitous failures of prediction usually have a lot in common. We focus on those signals that tell a story about the world as we would like it to be, not how it really is. We ignore the risks that are hardest to measure, even when they pose the greatest threats to our well-being. We make approximations and assumptions about the world that are much cruder than we realize. We abhor uncertainty, even when it is an irreducible part of the problem we are trying to solve. If we want to get at the heart of the financial crisis, we should begin by identifying the greatest predictive failure of all, a prediction that committed all these mistakes.

The ratings agencies had given their AAA rating, normally reserved for a handful of the world's most solvent governments and best-run businesses, to thousands of mortgage-backed securities, financial instruments that allowed investors to bet on the likelihood of someone else defaulting on their home. The ratings issued by these companies are quite explicitly meant to be predictions: estimates of the likelihood that a piece of debt will go into default.5 Standard & Poor's told investors, for instance, that when it rated a particularly complex type of security known as a collateralized debt obligation (CDO) at AAA, there was only a 0.12 percent probability—about 1 chance in 850—that it would fail to pay out over the next five years.6 This supposedly made it as safe as a AAA-rated corporate bond7 and safer than S&P now assumes U.S. Treasury bonds to be.8 The ratings agencies do not grade on a curve.

In fact, around 28 percent of the AAA-rated CDOs defaulted, according to S&P's internal figures.9 (Some independent estimates are even higher.10) That means that the actual default rates for CDOs were more than two hundred times higher than S&P had predicted.11

This is just about as complete a failure as it is possible to make in a prediction: trillions of dollars in investments that were rated as being almost completely safe instead turned out to be almost completely unsafe. It was as if the weather forecast had been 86 degrees and sunny, and instead there was a blizzard.

FIGURE 1-1: FORECASTED AND ACTUAL 5-YEAR DEFAULT RATES FOR AAA-RATED CDO TRANCHES

When you make a prediction that goes so badly, you have a choice of how to explain it. One path is to blame external circumstances—what we might think of as "bad luck." Sometimes this is a reasonable choice, or even the correct one. When the National Weather Service says there is a 90 percent chance of clear skies, but it rains instead and spoils your golf outing, you can't really blame them. Decades of historical data show that when the Weather Service says there is a 1 in 10 chance of rain, it really does rain about 10 percent of the time over the long run.*

This explanation becomes less credible, however, when the forecaster does not have a history of successful predictions and when the magnitude of his error is larger. In these cases, it is much more likely that the fault lies with the forecaster's model of the world and not with the world itself.

In the instance of CDOs, the ratings agencies had no track record at all: these were new and highly novel securities, and the default rates claimed by S&P were not derived from historical data but instead were assumptions based on a faulty statistical model. Meanwhile, the magnitude of their error was enormous: AAA-rated CDOs were two hundred times more likely to default in practice than they were in theory.

The ratings agencies' shot at redemption would be to admit that the models had been flawed and the mistake had been theirs. But at the congressional hearing, they shirked responsibility and claimed to have been unlucky. They blamed an external contingency: the housing bubble.

"S&P is not alone in having been taken by surprise by the extreme decline in the housing and mortgage markets," Deven Sharma, the head of Standard & Poor's, told Congress that October.12 "Virtually no one, be they homeowners, financial institutions, rating agencies, regulators or investors, anticipated what is coming."

Nobody saw it coming. When you can't state your innocence, proclaim your ignorance: this is often the first line of defense when there is a failed forecast.13 But Sharma's statement was a lie, in the grand congressional tradition of "I did not have sexual relations with that woman" and "I have never used steroids."

What is remarkable about the housing bubble is the number of people who did see it coming—and who said so well in advance. Robert Shiller, the Yale economist, had noted its beginnings as early as 2000 in his book Irrational Exuberance.14 Dean Baker, a caustic economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, had written about the bubble in August 2002.15 A correspondent at the Economist magazine, normally known for its staid prose, had spoken of the "biggest bubble in history" in June 2005.16 Paul Krugman, the Nobel Prize–winning economist, wrote of the bubble and its inevitable end in August 2005.17 "This was baked into the system," Krugman later told me. "The housing crash was not a black swan. The housing crash was the elephant in the room."

Ordinary Americans were also concerned. Google searches on the term "housing bubble" increased roughly tenfold from January 2004 through summer 2005.18 Interest in the term was heaviest in those states, like California, that had seen the largest run-up in housing prices19—and which were about to experience the largest decline. In fact, discussion of the bubble was remarkably widespread. Instances of the two-word phrase "housing bubble" had appeared in just eight news accounts in 200120 but jumped to 3,447 references by 2005. The housing bubble was discussed about ten times per day in reputable newspapers and periodicals.21

And yet, the ratings agencies—whose job it is to measure risk in financial markets—say that they missed it. It should tell you something that they seem to think of this as their best line of defense. The problems with their predictions ran very deep.

"I Don't Think They Wanted the Music to Stop"

None of the economists and investors I spoke with for this chapter had a favorable view of the ratings agencies. But they were divided on whether their bad ratings reflected avarice or ignorance—did they know any better?

Jules Kroll is perhaps uniquely qualified to pass judgment on this question: he runs a ratings agency himself. Founded in 2009, Kroll Bond Ratings had just issued its first rating—on a mortgage loan made to the builders of a gigantic shopping center in Arlington, Virginia—when I met him at his office in New York in 2011.

Kroll faults the ratings agencies most of all for their lack of "surveillance." It is an ironic term coming from Kroll, who before getting into the ratings game had become modestly famous (and somewhat immodestly rich) from his original company, Kroll Inc., which acted as a sort of detective agency to patrol corporate fraud. They knew how to sniff out a scam—such as the case of the kidnappers who took a hedge-fund billionaire hostage but foiled themselves by charging a pizza to his credit card.22 Kroll was sixty-nine years old when I met him, but his bloodhound instincts are keen—and they were triggered when he began to examine what the ratings agencies were doing.

"Surveillance is a term of art in the ratings industry," Kroll told me. "It means keeping investors informed as to what you're seeing. Every month you get a tape* of things like defaults on mortgages, prepayment of mortgages—you get a lot of data. That is the early warning—are things getting better or worse? The world expects you to keep them posted."

The ratings agencies ought to have been just about the first ones to detect problems in the housing market, in other words. They had better information than anyone else: fresh data on whether thousands of borrowers were making their mortgage payments on time. But they did not begin to downgrade large batches of mortgage-backed securities until 2007—at which point the problems had become manifest and foreclosure rates had already doubled.23

"These are not stupid people," Kroll told me. "They knew. I don't think they wanted the music to stop."

Kroll Bond Ratings is one of ten registered NRSROs, or nationally recognized statistical rating organizations, firms that are licensed by the Securities and Exchange Commission to rate debt-backed securities. But Moody's, S&P, and Fitch are three of the others, and they have had almost all the market share; S&P and Moody's each rated almost 97 percent of the CDOs that were issued prior to the financial collapse.24

One reason that S&P and Moody's enjoyed such a dominant market presence is simply that they had been a part of the club for a long time. They are part of a legal oligopoly; entry into the industry is limited by the government. Meanwhile, a seal of approval from S&P and Moody's is often mandated by the bylaws of large pension funds,25 about two-thirds of which26 mention S&P, Moody's, or both by name, requiring that they rate a piece of debt before the pension fund can purchase it.27

S&P and Moody's had taken advantage of their select status to build up exceptional profits despite picking résumés out of Wall Street's reject pile.* Moody's28 revenue from so-called structured-finance ratings increased by more than 800 percent between 1997 and 2007 and came to represent the majority of their ratings business during the bubble years.29 These products helped Moody's to the highest profit margin of any company in the S&P 500 for five consecutive years during the housing bubble.30 (In 2010, even after the bubble burst and the problems with the ratings agencies had become obvious, Moody's still made a 25 percent profit.31)

With large profits locked in so long as new CDOs continued to be issued, and no way for investors to verify the accuracy of their ratings until it was too late, the agencies had little incentive to compete on the basis of quality. The CEO of Moody's, Raymond McDaniel, explicitly told his board that ratings quality was the least important factor driving the company's profits.32

Instead their equation was simple. The ratings agencies were paid by the issuer of the CDO every time they rated one: the more CDOs, the more profit. A virtually unlimited number of CDOs could be created by combining different types of mortgages—or when that got boring, combining different types of CDOs into derivatives of one another. Rarely did the ratings agencies turn down the opportunity to rate one. A government investigation later uncovered an instant-message exchange between two senior Moody's employees in which one claimed that a security "could be structured by cows" and Moody's would rate it.33 In some cases, the ratings agencies went further still and abetted debt issuers in manipulating the ratings. In what it claimed was a nod to transparency,34 S&P provided the issuers with copies of their ratings software. This made it easy for the issuers to determine exactly how many bad mortgages they could add to the pool without seeing its rating decline.35

The possibility of a housing bubble, and that it might burst, thus represented a threat to the ratings agencies' gravy train. Human beings have an extraordinary capacity to ignore risks that threaten their livelihood, as though this will make them go away. So perhaps Deven Sharma's claim isn't so implausible—perhaps the ratings agencies really had missed the housing bubble, even if others hadn't.

In fact, however, the ratings agencies quite explicitly considered the possibility that there was a housing bubble. They concluded, remarkably, that it would be no big deal. A memo provided to me by an S&P spokeswoman, Catherine Mathis, detailed how S&P had conducted a simulation in 2005 that anticipated a 20 percent decline in national housing prices over a two-year period—not far from the roughly 30 percent decline in housing prices that actually occurred between 2006 and 2008. The memo concluded that S&P's existing models "captured the risk of a downturn" adequately and that its highly rated securities would "weather a housing downturn without suffering a credit-rating downgrade."36

In some ways this is even more troubling than if the ratings agencies had missed the housing bubble entirely. In this book, I'll discuss the danger of "unknown unknowns"—the risks that we are not even aware of. Perhaps the only greater threat is the risks we think we have a handle on, but don't.* In these cases we not only fool ourselves, but our false confidence may be contagious. In the case of the ratings agencies, it helped to infect the entire financial system. "The major difference between a thing that might go wrong and a thing that cannot possibly go wrong is that when a thing that cannot possibly go wrong goes wrong it usually turns out to be impossible to get at or repair," wrote Douglas Adams in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series.37

But how did the ratings agencies' models, which had all the auspices of scientific precision, do such a poor job of describing reality?

How the Ratings Agencies Got It Wrong

We have to dig a bit deeper to find the source of the problem. The answer requires a little bit of detail about how financial instruments like CDOs are structured, and a little bit about the distinction between uncertainty and risk.

CDOs are collections of mortgage debt that are broken into different pools, or "tranches," some of which are supposed to be quite risky and others of which are rated as almost completely safe. My friend Anil Kashyap, who teaches a course on the financial crisis to students at the University of Chicago, has come up with a simplified example of a CDO, and I'll use a version of this example here.

Imagine you have a set of five mortgages, each of which you assume has a 5 percent chance of defaulting. You can create a number of bets based on the status of these mortgages, each of which is progressively more risky.

The safest of these bets, what I'll call the Alpha Pool, pays out unless all five of the mortgages default. The riskiest, the Epsilon Pool, leaves you on the hook if any of the five mortgages defaults. Then there are other steps along the way.

Why might an investor prefer making a bet on the Epsilon Pool to the Alpha Pool? That's easy—because it will be priced more cheaply to account for the greater risk. But say you're a risk-averse investor, such as a pension fund, and that your bylaws prohibit you from investing in poorly rated securities. If you're going to buy anything, it will be the Alpha Pool, which will assuredly be rated AAA.

The Alpha Pool consists of five mortgages, each of which has only a 5 percent chance of defaulting. You lose the bet only if all five actually do default. What is the risk of that happening?

Actually, that is not an easy question—and therein lies the problem. The assumptions and approximations you choose will yield profoundly different answers. If you make the wrong assumptions, your model may be extraordinarily wrong.

One assumption is that each mortgage is independent of the others. In this scenario, your risks are well diversified: if a carpenter in Cleveland defaults on his mortgage, this will have no bearing on whether a dentist in Denver does. Under this scenario, the risk of losing your bet would be exceptionally small—the equivalent of rolling snake eyes five times in a row. Specifically, it would be 5 percent taken to the fifth power, which is just one chance in 3,200,000. This supposed miracle of diversification is how the ratings agencies claimed that a group of subprime mortgages that had just a B+ credit rating on average38—which would ordinarily imply39 more than a 20 percent chance of default40—had almost no chance of defaulting when pooled together.

The other extreme is to assume that the mortgages, instead of being entirely independent of one another, will all behave exactly alike. That is, either all five mortgages will default or none will. Instead of getting five separate rolls of the dice, you're now staking your bet on the outcome of just one. There's a 5 percent chance that you will roll snake eyes and all the mortgages will default—making your bet 160,000 times riskier than you had thought originally.41

Which of these assumptions is more valid will depend on economic conditions. If the economy and the housing market are healthy, the first scenario—the five mortgages have nothing to do with one another—might be a reasonable approximation. Defaults are going to happen from time to time because of unfortunate rolls of the dice: someone gets hit with a huge medical bill, or they lose their job. However, one person's default risk won't have much to do with another's.

But suppose instead that there is some common factor that ties the fate of these homeowners together. For instance: there is a massive housing bubble that has caused home prices to rise by 80 percent without any tangible improvement in the fundamentals. Now you've got trouble: if one borrower defaults, the rest might succumb to the same problems. The risk of losing your bet has increased by orders of magnitude.

The latter scenario was what came into being in the United States beginning in 2007 (we'll conduct a short autopsy on the housing bubble later in this chapter). But it was the former assumption of largely uncorrelated risks that the ratings agencies had bet on. Although the problems with this assumption were understood in the academic literature42 and by whistle-blowers at the ratings agencies43 long before the housing bubble burst, the efforts the ratings agencies made to account for it were feeble.

Moody's, for instance, went through a period of making ad hoc adjustments to its model44 in which it increased the default probability assigned to AAA-rated securities by 50 percent. That might seem like a very prudent attitude: surely a 50 percent buffer will suffice to account for any slack in one's assumptions?

It might have been fine had the potential for error in their forecasts been linear and arithmetic. But leverage, or investments financed by debt, can make the error in a forecast compound many times over, and introduces the potential of highly geometric and nonlinear mistakes. Moody's 50 percent adjustment was like applying sunscreen and claiming it protected you from a nuclear meltdown—wholly inadequate to the scale of the problem. It wasn't just a possibility that their estimates of default risk could be 50 percent too low: they might just as easily have underestimated it by 500 percent or 5,000 percent. In practice, defaults were two hundred times more likely than the ratings agencies claimed, meaning that their model was off by a mere 20,000 percent.

In a broader sense, the ratings agencies' problem was in being unable or uninterested in appreciating the distinction between risk and uncertainty.

Risk, as first articulated by the economist Frank H. Knight in 1921,45 is something that you can put a price on. Say that you'll win a poker hand unless your opponent draws to an inside straight: the chances of that happening are exactly 1 chance in 11.46 This is risk. It is not pleasant when you take a "bad beat" in poker, but at least you know the odds of it and can account for it ahead of time. In the long run, you'll make a profit from your opponents making desperate draws with insufficient odds.

Uncertainty, on the other hand, is risk that is hard to measure. You might have some vague awareness of the demons lurking out there. You might even be acutely concerned about them. But you have no real idea how many of them there are or when they might strike. Your back-of-the-envelope estimate might be off by a factor of 100 or by a factor of 1,000; there is no good way to know. This is uncertainty. Risk greases the wheels of a free-market economy; uncertainty grinds them to a halt.

The alchemy that the ratings agencies performed was to spin uncertainty into what looked and felt like risk. They took highly novel securities, subject to an enormous amount of systemic uncertainty, and claimed the ability to quantify just how risky they were. Not only that, but of all possible conclusions, they came to the astounding one that these investments were almost risk-free.

Too many investors mistook these confident conclusions for accurate ones, and too few made backup plans in case things went wrong.

And yet, while the ratings agencies bear substantial responsibility for the financial crisis, they were not alone in making mistakes. The story of the financial crisis as a failure of prediction can be told in three acts.

Act I: The Housing Bubble

An American home has not, historically speaking, been a lucrative investment. In fact, according to an index developed by Robert Shiller and his colleague Karl Case, the market price of an American home has barely increased at all over the long run. After adjusting for inflation, a $10,000 investment made in a home in 1896 would be worth just $10,600 in 1996. The rate of return had been less in a century than the stock market typically produces in a single year.47

But if a home was not a profitable investment it had at least been a safe one. Prior to the 2000s, the most significant shift in American housing prices had come in the years immediately following World War II, when they increased by about 60 percent relative to their nadir in 1942.

The housing boom of the 1950s, however, had almost nothing in common with the housing bubble of the 2000s. The comparison helps to reveal why the 2000s became such a mess.

The postwar years were associated with a substantial shift in living patterns. Americans had emerged from the war with a glut of savings48 and into an age of prosperity. There was a great demand for larger living spaces. Between 1940 and 1960, the homeownership rate surged to 62 percent from 44 percent,49 with most of the growth concentrated in the suburbs.50 Furthermore, the housing boom was accompanied by the baby boom: the U.S. population was growing at a rate of about 20 percent per decade after the war, about twice its rate of growth during the 2000s. This meant that the number of homeowners increased by about 80 percent during the decade—meeting or exceeding the increase in housing prices.

In the 2000s, by contrast, homeownership rates increased only modestly: to a peak of about 69 percent in 2005 from 65 percent a decade earlier.51 Few Americans who hadn't already bought a home were in a position to afford one. The 40th percentile of household incomes increased by a nominal 15 percent between 2000 and 200652—not enough to cover inflation, let alone a new home.

Instead, the housing boom had been artificially enhanced—through speculators looking to flip homes and through ever more dubious loans to ever less creditworthy consumers. The 2000s were associated with record-low rates of savings: barely above 1 percent in some years. But a mortgage was easier to obtain than ever.53 Prices had become untethered from supply and demand, as lenders, brokers, and the ratings agencies—all of whom profited in one way or another from every home sale—strove to keep the party going.

If the United States had never experienced such a housing bubble before, however, other countries had—and results had been uniformly disastrous. Shiller, studying data going back hundreds of years in countries from the Netherlands to Norway, found that as real estate grew to unaffordable levels a crash almost inevitably followed.54 The infamous Japanese real estate bubble of the early 1990s forms a particularly eerie precedent to the recent U.S. housing bubble, for instance. The price of commercial real estate in Japan increased by about 76 percent over the ten-year period between 1981 and 1991 but then declined by 31 percent over the next five years, a close fit for the trajectory that American home prices took during and after the bubble55 (figure 1-4).

Shiller uncovered another key piece of evidence for the bubble: the people buying the homes had completely unrealistic assumptions about what their investments might return. A survey commissioned by Case and Schiller in 2003 found that homeowners expected their properties to appreciate at a rate of about 13 percent per year.56 In practice, over that one-hundred-year period from 1896 through 199657 to which I referred earlier, sale prices of houses had increased by just 6 percent total after inflation, or about 0.06 percent annually.

These homeowners can perhaps be excused for their overconfidence in the housing market. The housing bubble had seeped into the culture to the point where two separate TV programs—one named Flip This House and the other named Flip That House—were launched within ten days of each other in 2005. Even home buyers who weren't counting on a huge return on investment may have been concerned about keeping up with the Joneses. "I can remember twenty years ago, on the road to Sacramento, there were no traffic jams," I was told by George Akerlof, a frequent colleague of Shiller's, whose office at the University of California at Berkeley sits at the epicenter of some of the worst declines in housing prices. "Now there tend to be traffic stoppages a good share of the way. That's what people were thinking—if I don't buy now then I'm gonna pay the same price in five years for a house that's ten miles up the road."

Whether homeowners believed that they couldn't lose on a home or couldn't choose to defer the purchase, conditions were growing grimmer by the month. By late 2007 there were clear signs of trouble: home prices had declined over the year in seventeen of the twenty largest markets.58 More ominous was the sharp decline in housing permits, a leading indicator of housing demand, which had fallen by 50 percent from their peak.59 Creditors, meanwhile—finally seeing the consequences of their lax standards in the subprime lending market—were becoming less willing to make loans. Foreclosures had doubled by the end of 2007.60

Policy makers' first instinct was to reinflate the bubble. Governor Charlie Crist of Florida, one of the worst-hit states, proposed a $10,000 credit for new home buyers.61 A bill passed by the U.S. Congress in February 2008 went further, substantially expanding the lending capacity of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in that hope that more home sales might be spurred.62 Instead, housing prices continued their inexorable decline, falling a further 20 percent during 2008.

Act II: Leverage, Leverage, Leverage

While quite a few economists identified the housing bubble as it occurred, fewer grasped the consequences of a housing-price collapse for the broader economy. In December 2007, economists in the Wall Street Journal forecasting panel predicted only a 38 percent likelihood of a recession over the next year. This was remarkable because, the data would later reveal, the economy was already in recession at the time. The economists in another panel, the Survey of Professional Forecasters, thought there was less than a 1 in 500 chance that the economy would crash as badly as it did.63

There were two major factors that the economists missed. The first was simply the effect that a drop in housing prices might have on the finances of the average American. As of 2007, middle-class Americans64 had more than 65 percent of their wealth tied up in their homes.65 Otherwise they had been getting poorer—they had been using their household equity as ATMs.66 Nonhousehold wealth—meaning the sum total of things like savings, stocks, pensions, cash, and equity in small businesses—declined by 14 percent67 for the median family between 2001 and 2007.68 When the collapse of the housing bubble wiped essentially all their housing equity off the books, middle-class Americans found they were considerably worse off than they had been a few years earlier.

The decline in consumer spending that resulted as consumers came to take a more realistic view of their finances—what economists call a "wealth effect"—is variously estimated at between about 1.5 percent69 and 3.5 percent70 of GDP per year, potentially enough to turn average growth into a recession. But a garden-variety recession is one thing. A global financial crisis is another, and the wealth effect does not suffice to explain how the housing bubble triggered one.

In fact, the housing market is a fairly small part of the financial system. In 2007, the total volume of home sales in the United States was about $1.7 trillion—paltry when compared with the $40 trillion in stocks that are traded every year. But in contrast to the activity that was taking place on Main Street, Wall Street was making bets on housing at furious rates. In 2007, the total volume of trades in mortgage-backed securities was about $80 trillion.71 That meant that for every dollar that someone was willing to put in a mortgage, Wall Street was making almost $50 worth of bets on the side.72

Now we have the makings of a financial crisis: home buyers' bets were multiplied fifty times over. The problem can be summed up in a single word: leverage.

If you borrow $20 to wager on the Redskins to beat the Cowboys, that is a leveraged bet.* Likewise, it's leverage when you borrow money to take out a mortgage—or when you borrow money to bet on a mortgage-backed security.

Lehman Brothers, in 2007, had a leverage ratio of about 33 to 1,73 meaning that it had about $1 in capital for every $33 in financial positions that it held. This meant that if there was just a 3 to 4 percent decline in the value of its portfolio, Lehman Brothers would have negative equity and would potentially face bankruptcy.74

Lehman was not alone in being highly levered: the leverage ratio for other major U.S. banks was about 30 and had been increasing steadily in the run-up to the financial crisis.75 Although historical data on leverage ratios for U.S. banks is spotty, an analysis by the Bank of England on United Kingdom banks suggests that the overall degree of leverage in the system was either near its historical highs in 2007 or was perhaps altogether unprecedented.76

What particularly distinguished Lehman Brothers, however, was its voracious appetite for mortgage-backed securities. The $85 billion it held in mortgage-backed securities in 2007 was about four times more than the underlying value of its capital, meaning that a 25 percent decline in their value would likely be enough to bankrupt the company.77

Ordinarily, investors would have been extremely reluctant to purchase assets like these—or at least they would have hedged their bets very carefully.

"If you're in a market and someone's trying to sell you something which you don't understand," George Akerlof told me, "you should think that they're selling you a lemon."

Akerlof wrote a famous paper on this subject called "The Market for Lemons"78—it won him a Nobel Prize. In the paper, he demonstrated that in a market plagued by asymmetries of information, the quality of goods will decrease and the market will come to be dominated by crooked sellers and gullible or desperate buyers.

Imagine that a stranger walked up to you on the street and asked if you were interested in buying his used car. He showed you the Blue Book value but was not willing to let you take a test-drive. Wouldn't you be a little suspicious? The core problem in this case is that the stranger knows much more about the car—its repair history, its mileage—than you do. Sensible buyers will avoid transacting in a market like this one at any price. It is a case of uncertainty trumping risk. You know that you'd need a discount to buy from him—but it's hard to know how much exactly it ought to be. And the lower the man is willing to go on the price, the more convinced you may become that the offer is too good to be true. There may be no such thing as a fair price.

But now imagine that the stranger selling you the car has someone else to vouch for him. Someone who seems credible and trustworthy—a close friend of yours, or someone with whom you have done business previously. Now you might reconsider. This is the role that the ratings agencies played. They vouched for mortgage-backed securities with lots of AAA ratings and helped to enable a market for them that might not otherwise have existed. The market was counting on them to be the Debbie Downer of the mortgage party—but they were acting more like Robert Downey Jr.

Lehman Brothers, in particular, could have used a designated driver. In a conference call in March 2007, Lehman CFO Christopher O'Meara told investors that the recent "hiccup" in the markets did not concern him and that Lehman hoped to do some "bottom fishing" from others who were liquidating their positions prematurely.79 He explained that the credit quality in the mortgage market was "very strong"—a conclusion that could only have been reached by looking at the AAA ratings for the securities and not at the subprime quality of the collateral. Lehman had bought a lemon.

One year later, as the housing bubble began to burst, Lehman was desperately trying to sell its position. But with the skyrocketing premiums that investors were demanding for credit default swaps—investments that pay you out in the event of a default and which therefore provide the primary means of insurance against one—they were only able to reduce their exposure by about 20 percent.80 It was too little and too late, and Lehman went bankrupt on September 14, 2008.

Intermission: Fear Is the New Greed

The precise sequence of events that followed the Lehman bankruptcy could fill its own book (and has been described in some excellent ones, like Too Big to Fail). It should suffice to remember that when a financial company dies, it can continue to haunt the economy through an afterlife of unmet obligations. If Lehman Brothers was no longer able to pay out on the losing bets that it had made, this meant that somebody else suddenly had a huge hole in his portfolio. Their problems, in turn, might affect yet other companies, with the effects cascading throughout the financial system. Investors and lenders, gawking at the accident but unsure about who owed what to whom, might become unable to distinguish the solvent companies from the zombies and unwilling to lend money at any price, preventing even healthy companies from functioning effectively.

It is for this reason that governments—at great cost to taxpayers as well as to their popularity—sometimes bail out failing financial firms. But the Federal Reserve, which did bail out Bear Stearns and AIG, elected not to do so for Lehman Brothers, defying the expectations of investors and causing the Dow to crash by 500 points when it opened for business the next morning.

Why the government bailed out Bear Stearns and AIG but not Lehman remains unclear. One explanation is that Lehman had been so irresponsible, and its financial position had become so decrepit, that the government wasn't sure what could be accomplished at what price and didn't want to chase good money after bad.81

Larry Summers, who was the director of the National Economic Council at the time that I met him in the White House in December 2009,82 told me that the United States might have had a modestly better outcome had it bailed out Lehman Brothers. But with the excess of leverage in the system, some degree of pain was inevitable.

"It was a self-denying prophecy," Summers told me of the financial crisis. "Everybody leveraged substantially, and when everybody leverages substantially, there's substantial fragility, and their complacency proves to be unwarranted."

"Lehman was a burning cigarette in a very dry forest," he continued a little later. "If that hadn't happened, it's quite likely that something else would have."

Summers thinks of the American economy as consisting of a series of feedback loops. One simple feedback is between supply and demand. Imagine that you are running a lemonade stand.83 You lower the price of lemonade and sales go up; raise it and they go down. If you're making lots of profit because it's 100 degrees outside and you're the only lemonade stand on the block, the annoying kid across the street opens his own lemonade stand and undercuts your price.

Supply and demand is an example of a negative feedback: as prices go up, sales go down. Despite their name, negative feedbacks are a good thing for a market economy. Imagine if the opposite were true and as prices went up, sales went up. You raise the price of lemonade from 25 cents to $2.50—but instead of declining, sales double.84 Now you raise the price from $2.50 to $25 and they double again. Eventually, you're charging $46,000 for a glass of lemonade—the average income in the United States each year—and all 300 million Americans are lined up around the block to get their fix.

This would be an example of a positive feedback. And while it might seem pretty cool at first, you'd soon discover that everyone in the country had gone broke on lemonade. There would be nobody left to manufacture all the video games you were hoping to buy with your profits.

Usually, in Summers's view, negative feedbacks predominate in the American economy, behaving as a sort of thermostat that prevents it from going into recession or becoming overheated. Summers thinks one of the most important feedbacks is between what he calls fear and greed. Some investors have little appetite for risk and some have plenty, but their preferences balance out: if the price of a stock goes down because a company's financial position deteriorates, the fearful investor sells his shares to a greedy one who is hoping to bottom-feed.

Greed and fear are volatile quantities, however, and the balance can get out of whack. When there is an excess of greed in the system, there is a bubble. When there is an excess of fear, there is a panic.

Ordinarily, we benefit from consulting our friends and neighbors before making a decision. But when their judgment is compromised, this means that ours will be too. People tend to estimate the prices of houses by making comparisons to other houses85—if the three-bedroom home in the new subdivision across town is selling for $400,000, the colonial home around the block suddenly looks like steal at $350,000. Under these circumstances, if the price of one house increases, it may make the other houses seem more attractive rather than less.

Or say that you are considering buying another type of asset: a mortgage-backed security. This type of commodity may be even harder to value. But the more investors buy them—and the more the ratings agencies vouch for them—the more confidence you might have that they are safe and worthwhile investments. Hence, you have a positive feedback—and the potential for a bubble.

A negative feedback did eventually rein in the housing market: there weren't any Americans left who could afford homes at their current prices. For that matter, many Americans who had bought homes couldn't really afford them in the first place, and soon their mortgages were underwater. But this was not until trillions of dollars in bets, highly leveraged and impossible to unwind without substantial damage to the economy, had been made on the premise that all the people buying these assets couldn't possibly be wrong.

"We had too much greed and too little fear," Summers told me in 2009. "Now we have too much fear and too little greed."

Act III: This Time Wasn't Different

Once the housing bubble had burst, greedy investors became fearful ones who found uncertainty lurking around every corner. The process of disentangling a financial crisis—everyone trying to figure out who owes what to whom—can produce hangovers that persist for a very long time. The economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff, studying volumes of financial history for their book This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly, found that financial crises typically produce rises in unemployment that persist for four to six years.86 Another study by Reinhart, which focused on more recent financial crises, found that ten of the last fifteen countries to endure one had never seen their unemployment rates recover to their precrisis levels.87 This stands in contrast to normal recessions, in which there is typically above-average growth in the year or so following the recession88 as the economy reverts to the mean, allowing employment to catch up quickly. Yet despite its importance, many economic models made no distinction between the financial system and other parts of the economy.

Reinhart and Rogoff's history lesson was one that the White House might have done more to heed. Soon, they would be responsible for their own notoriously bad prediction.

In January 2009, as Barack Obama was about to take the oath of office, the White House's incoming economic team—led by Summers and Christina Romer, the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers—were charged with preparing the blueprint for a massive stimulus package that was supposed to make up for the lack of demand among consumers and businesses. Romer thought that $1.2 trillion in stimulus was called for.89 Eventually, the figure was revised downward to about $800 billion after objections from the White House's political team that a trillion-dollar price would be difficult to sell to Congress.

To help pitch the Congress and the country on the stimulus, Romer and her colleagues prepared a memo90 outlining the depth of the crisis and what the stimulus might do to ameliorate it. The memo prominently featured a graphic predicting how the unemployment rate would track with and without the stimulus. Without the stimulus, the memo said, the unemployment rate, which had been 7.3 percent when last reported in December 2008, would peak at about 9 percent in early 2010. But with the stimulus, employment would never rise above 8 percent and would begin to turn downward as early as July 2009.

Congress passed the stimulus on a party-line vote in February 2009. But unemployment continued to rise—to 9.5 percent in July and then to a peak of 10.1 percent in October 2009. This was much worse than the White House had projected even under the "no stimulus" scenario. Conservative bloggers cheekily updated Romer's graphic every month—but with the actual unemployment rate superimposed on the too-cheery projections (figure 1-6).

FIGURE 1-6: WHITE HOUSE ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS, JANUARY 2009

People see this graphic now and come to different—and indeed entirely opposite—conclusions about it. Paul Krugman, who had argued from the start that the stimulus was too small,91 sees it as proof that the White House had dramatically underestimated the shortfall in demand. "The fact that unemployment didn't come down much in the wake of this particular stimulus means that we knew we were facing one hell of a shock from the financial crisis," he told me. Other economists, of course, take the graph as evidence that the stimulus had completely failed.92

The White House can offer its version of S&P's "everyone else made the same mistake" defense. Its forecasts were largely in line with those issued by independent economists at the time.93 Meanwhile, the initial economic statistics had significantly underestimated the magnitude of the crisis.94 The government's first estimate—the one available to Romer and Summers at the time the stimulus was being sold—was that GDP had declined at a rate of 3.8 percent in the fall of 2008.95 In fact, the financial crisis had taken more than twice as large a bite out of the economy. The actual rate of GDP decline had been closer to 9 percent,96 meaning that the country was about $200 billion poorer than the government first estimated.

Perhaps the White House's more inexcusable error was in making such a precise-seeming forecast—and in failing to prepare the public for the eventuality that it might be wrong. No economist, whether in the White House or elsewhere, has been able to predict the progress of major economic indicators like the unemployment rate with much success. (I take a more detailed look at macroeconomic forecasting in chapter 6.) The uncertainty in an unemployment rate forecast97 made during a recession had historically been about plus or minus 2 percent.98 So even if the White House thought 8 percent unemployment was the most likely outcome, it might easily enough have wound up in the double digits instead (or it might have declined to as low as 6 percent).

There is also considerable uncertainty about how effective stimulus spending really is. Estimates of the multiplier effect—how much each dollar in stimulus spending contributes to growth—vary radically from study to study,99 with some claiming that $1 in stimulus spending returns as much as $4 in GDP growth and others saying the return is just 60 cents on the dollar. When you layer the large uncertainty intrinsic to measuring the effects of stimulus atop the large uncertainty intrinsic to making macroeconomic forecasts of any kind, you have the potential for a prediction that goes very badly.

What the Forecasting Failures Had in Common

There were at least four major failures of prediction that accompanied the financial crisis.

The housing bubble can be thought of as a poor prediction. Homeowners and investors thought that rising prices implied that home values would continue to rise, when in fact history suggested this made them prone to decline.

There was a failure on the part of the ratings agencies, as well as by banks like Lehman Brothers, to understand how risky mortgage-backed securities were. Contrary to the assertions they made before Congress, the problem was not that the ratings agencies failed to see the housing bubble. Instead, their forecasting models were full of faulty assumptions and false confidence about the risk that a collapse in housing prices might present.

There was a widespread failure to anticipate how a housing crisis could trigger a global financial crisis. It had resulted from the high degree of leverage in the market, with $50 in side bets staked on every $1 that an American was willing to invest in a new home.

Finally, in the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis, there was a failure to predict the scope of the economic problems that it might create. Economists and policy makers did not heed Reinhart and Rogoff's finding that financial crises typically produce very deep and long-lasting recessions.

There is a common thread among these failures of prediction. In each case, as people evaluated the data, they ignored a key piece of context:

The confidence that homeowners had about housing prices may have stemmed from the fact that there had not been a substantial decline in U.S. housing prices in the recent past. However, there had never before been such a widespread increase in U.S. housing prices like the one that preceded the collapse.

The confidence that the banks had in Moody's and S&P's ability to rate mortgage-backed securities may have been based on the fact that the agencies had generally performed competently in rating other types of financial assets. However, the ratings agencies had never before rated securities as novel and complex as credit default options.

The confidence that economists had in the ability of the financial system to withstand a housing crisis may have arisen because housing price fluctuations had generally not had large effects on the financial system in the past. However, the financial system had probably never been so highly leveraged, and it had certainly never made so many side bets on housing before.

The confidence that policy makers had in the ability of the economy to recuperate quickly from the financial crisis may have come from their experience of recent recessions, most of which had been associated with rapid, "V-shaped" recoveries. However, those recessions had not been associated with financial crises, and financial crises are different.

There is a technical term for this type of problem: the events these forecasters were considering were out of sample. When there is a major failure of prediction, this problem usually has its fingerprints all over the crime scene.

What does the term mean? A simple example should help to explain it.

Out of Sample, Out of Mind: A Formula for a Failed Prediction

Suppose that you're a very good driver. Almost everyone thinks they're a good driver,100 but you really have the track record to prove it: just two minor fender benders in thirty years behind the wheel, during which time you have made 20,000 car trips.

You're also not much of a drinker, and one of the things you've absolutely never done is driven drunk. But one year you get a little carried away at your office Christmas party. A good friend of yours is leaving the company, and you've been under a lot of stress: one vodka tonic turns into about twelve. You're blitzed, three sheets to the wind. Should you drive home or call a cab?

That sure seems like an easy question to answer: take the taxi. And cancel your morning meeting.

But you could construct a facetious argument for driving yourself home that went like this: out of a sample of 20,000 car trips, you'd gotten into just two minor accidents, and gotten to your destination safely the other 19,998 times. Those seem like pretty favorable odds. Why go through the inconvenience of calling a cab in the face of such overwhelming evidence?

The problem, of course, is that of those 20,000 car trips, none occurred when you were anywhere near this drunk. Your sample size for drunk driving is not 20,000 trips but zero, and you have no way to use your past experience to forecast your accident risk. This is an example of an out-of-sample problem.

As easy as it might seem to avoid this sort of problem, the ratings agencies made just this mistake. Moody's estimated the extent to which mortgage defaults were correlated with one another by building a model from past data—specifically, they looked at American housing data going back to about the 1980s.101 The problem is that from the 1980s through the mid-2000s, home prices were always steady or increasing in the United States. Under these circumstances, the assumption that one homeowner's mortgage has little relationship to another's was probably good enough. But nothing in that past data would have described what happened when home prices began to decline in tandem. The housing collapse was an out-of-sample event, and their models were worthless for evaluating default risk under those conditions.

The Mistakes That Were Made—and What We Can Learn from Them

Moody's was not completely helpless, however. They could have come to some more plausible estimates by expanding their horizons. The United States had never experienced such a housing crash before—but other countries had, and the results had been ugly. Perhaps if Moody's had looked at default rates after the Japanese real estate bubble, they could have had some more realistic idea about the precariousness of mortgage-backed securities—and they would not have stamped their AAA rating on them.

But forecasters often resist considering these out-of-sample problems. When we expand our sample to include events further apart from us in time and space, it often means that we will encounter cases in which the relationships we are studying did not hold up as well as we are accustomed to. The model will seem to be less powerful. It will look less impressive in a PowerPoint presentation (or a journal article or a blog post). We will be forced to acknowledge that we know less about the world than we thought we did. Our personal and professional incentives almost always discourage us from doing this.

We forget—or we willfully ignore—that our models are simplifications of the world. We figure that if we make a mistake, it will be at the margin.

In complex systems, however, mistakes are not measured in degrees but in whole orders of magnitude. S&P and Moody's underestimated the default risk associated with CDOs by a factor of two hundred. Economists thought there was just a 1 in 500 chance of a recession as severe as what actually occurred.

One of the pervasive risks that we face in the information age, as I wrote in the introduction, is that even if the amount of knowledge in the world is increasing, the gap between what we know and what we think we know may be widening. This syndrome is often associated with very precise-seeming predictions that are not at all accurate. Moody's carried out their calculations to the second decimal place—but they were utterly divorced from reality. This is like claiming you are a good shot because your bullets always end up in about the same place—even though they are nowhere near the target (figure 1-7).

FIGURE 1-7: ACCURACY VERSUS PRECISION

Financial crises—and most other failures of prediction—stem from this false sense of confidence. Precise forecasts masquerade as accurate ones, and some of us get fooled and double-down our bets. It's exactly when we think we have overcome the flaws in our judgment that something as powerful as the American economy can be brought to a screeching halt.
