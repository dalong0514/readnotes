It is consistent with some of my earlier work in the field of knowledge management and collaboration theory, in part inspired by the work of Karl Erik Sveiby, where Louis Stokes and I developed the following definitions of data, information, knowledge and wisdom:Data are the pure and simple facts without any particular structure or organization, the basic atoms of information,Information is structured data, which adds more meaning to the data and gives them greater context and significance,Knowledge is the ability to use information strategically to achieve one's objectives, andWisdom is the capacity to choose objectives consistent with one's values and within a larger social context [23].I also found the following description of the relationship of data and information that I accessed on Wikipedia on September 12, 2007 particularly illuminating:Even though information and data are often used interchangeably, they are actually very different. Data is a set of unrelated information, and as such is of no use until it is properly evaluated. Upon evaluation, once there is some significant relation between data, and they show some relevance, then they are converted into information. Now this same data can be used for different purposes. Thus, till the data convey some information, they are not useful.I would interpret the signals transmitted between Shannon's sender and receiver as data. Consistent with MacKay and Bateson's position information makes a difference when it is contextualized and significant. Knowledge and wisdom represent higher order applications of information beyond the scope of this study. The contextualization of data so that it has meaning and significance and hence operates as information is an emergent phenomenon. The communication of information cannot be explained solely in terms of the components of the Shannon system consisting of the sender, the receiver and the signal or message. It is a much more complex process than the simplified system that Shannon considered for the purposes of mathematicizing and engineering the transmission of signals. First of all it entails the knowledge of the sender and the receiver, the intentions or objectives of the sender and the receiver in participating in the process and finally the effects of the channel of communication itself as in McLuhan's [24] observation that "the medium is the message". The knowledge and intention of the sender and the receiver as well as the effects of the channel all affect the meaning of the message that is transmitted by the signal in addition to its content.我同意 Langefors 的观点，即 Shannon 在他的信息理论中主要分析的是信号或数据的传输。这与我在知识管理和协作理论领域的一些早期工作相契合。这些工作部分受到 Karl Erik Sveiby 的启发。在此基础上，我和 Louis Stokes 制定了以下关于数据、信息、知识和智慧的定义：数据是纯粹的简单事实，没有特定的结构或组织，是信息的基本单位，信息是结构化的数据，增加了数据的意义和背景，知识是能够战略性地使用信息来实现目标的能力，智慧是选择与自身价值观一致并在更大社会背景下的目标的能力 [23]。我还发现了以下关于数据和信息关系的描述，特别是在 2007 年 9 月 12 日访问维基百科时看到的：尽管信息和数据经常被混用，但它们实际上是不同的。数据是一组未关联的信息，未经评估前没有任何用处。一旦数据被评估并显示出显著的关系和相关性，它们就转化为信息。这时，这些数据可以用于不同的目的。因此，数据只有在传达信息时才有用。我将 Shannon 的发送者和接收者之间传输的信号视为数据。根据 MacKay 和 Bateson 的观点，信息在被情境化并具有重要意义时才会产生不同的影响。知识和智慧代表了信息的更高层次应用，但这不在本研究的范围内。将数据情境化，使其具有意义和重要性，从而成为信息，是一种涌现现象。信息的传递不能仅靠 Shannon 系统中的发送者、接收者和信号或消息来解释。这一过程远比 Shannon 为数学化和工程化信号传输所设计的简化系统复杂得多。首先，这需要发送者和接收者的知识，其次是发送者和接收者参与过程的意图或目标，最后是通信渠道本身的影响，就像 McLuhan [24]所说的「媒介即信息」。发送者和接收者的知识和意图以及通信渠道的影响，都会影响信号传递的消息的意义，而不仅仅是它的内容。
