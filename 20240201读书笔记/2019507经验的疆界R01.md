LEARNING THROUGH REPLICATING SUCCESS

Extracting lessons from natural experience presumes a learning cycle that begins with observing associations between actions and outcomes, the rudiments of finding order in history. Learning takes place when the observation of associations produces changes in actions or rules for actions. Learning serves intelligence when those changes improve the actions or the rules. Changes from learning occur often and relatively easily, but their contribution to intelligence is more problematic. Experiential learning makes many mistakes.

从原始经验中挖掘启示，要遵循一定的步骤，首先是观察行动与结果有何联系，然后是初步发现存在什么规律。所谓学习，就是在观察行动与结果联系的基础上改变行动或行动规则。如果那些改变是改进，那么学习就促进智慧增长。学习经常而且容易带来改变，但是学习不一定促进智慧增长。体验式学习会出现很多错误。

### 2.1 智慧适应的两种模式

TWO MODES OF INTELLIGENT ADAPTATION

It is useful to distinguish two different modes of achieving intelligence through experience. The two modes reflect different kinds of processes and encounter different kinds of complications, so the distinction may be useful as long as it is recognized that actual occasions of learning involve mixtures of the two (Zollo and Winter 2002; Winter, Cattani, and Dorsch 2007; Starbuck, Barnett, and Baumard 2008; Winter 2009). The first mode — which might be called「lowintellect」learning — is one in which actions associated with success are replicated with little or no effort at causal understanding. The second mode — which might be called「highintellect」learning — is one in which explicit efforts are made to understand the causal structure of the events of experience and to derive action implications from that understanding. The distinction is closely related to that made by Starbuck, Barnett, and Baumard (2008) between noncognitive and cognitive learning and by Gul and Pesendorfer (2008) and Camerer (2008) between mindless and mindful economics, though the different terms contain somewhat different nuances. Low intellect and high intellect are not differentiated by merit. Each has its place; each has its limitations.

Low-intellect mechanisms of learning from experience are built on the replication of success and are common among both humans and other animal species. They often generate rules or heuristics of behavior that are surprisingly effective (Hutchinson and Gigerenzer 2005). High-intellect mechanisms, on the other hand, appear to be less prominent in the learning of other animals than they are among human beings. The entire academic apparatus for developing, recording, and dispensing knowledge derived from theories about the underlying causes of outcomes of experienced history is a distinctively human construction. That apparatus depends on the power of written language and instruments of symbolic manipulation that not only are uniquely human but have existed among humans only for the past few thousand years.

从经验中获取智慧的模式可以分为两种，这两种模式反映了两种不同过程，而且各有各的问题。所以，只要认识到实际的学习是两种模式兼而有之，这样的区分就是有用的（Zollo and Winter 2002；Winter，Gat-tani，and Dorsch 2007；Starbuck，Barnett，and Baumard 2008；Winter 2009）。

第一种模式，可以称作「低智」（low-intellect）学习，是指在不求理解因果结构的情况下复制与成功相连的行动。第二种模式，可以称作「高智」（high-intellect）学习，是指努力理解因果结构并用其指导以后的行动。斯塔巴克（Starbuck）、巴奈特（Barnett）和鲍马尔得（Baumard 2008）区分「非认知」（non-cognitive）学习和「认知」（cognitive）学习，古尔（Gul）和派森多佛（Pesendorfer 2008）、卡梅瑞（Camerer 2008）区分「无心（mindless）」经济学和「正念（mindful）」经济学，与这样的区分有异曲同工之妙。低智学习和高智学习没有优劣之分，各有可取处，各有局限性。

低智学习，基础是复制成功，在人类和其他物种当中都很常见。低智学习经常产生规则和有效得惊人的启发式行为（Hutchinson and Gigerenzer 2005）。另一方面，高智学习，似乎在其他物种当中不如在人类当中常见。只有人类才会「做学问」：观察历史经验，理解深层因果结构，形成知识，加以记录，进行传播。做学问必须具备书面语言和符号操纵工具，这两样不仅是人类特有的，而且出现在人类当中的历史并不长，只有几千年。

### 2.2 复制成功

THE REPLICATION OF SUCCESS

The basic idea of replication of success is inherent in a familiar set of ideas in studies of organizations. Organizations are often seen as comparing performance with an aspiration for performance and searching for changes primarily when performance falls below aspiration (Cyert and March 1963; Greve 2003; Baum and Dahlin 2007). Thus, actions associated with success are more likely to be reproduced than are actions associated with failure.

In its barest form, the replication of success is elegant in its simplicity:

(1) Act by choosing an alternative from among those available.

(2) Record a result and evaluate it in terms of its success.

(3) Replicate the choice of alternatives associated with successes more often than the choice of alternatives associated with failure.

Practices, forms, and rules that are associated with good outcomes survive longer and reproduce more than practices, forms, and rules that are associated with poor outcomes.

It should be observed that describing the replication of success as low-intellect (or「noncognitive」) is potentially misleading. Such a description ignores cognitive complications involved in the adaptive process. For example, in a classic binary learning task, a learner chooses repeatedly between two mutually exclusive and exhaustive alternatives. When consistently rewarded on one of the alternatives, the learner normally learns to choose it. However, even as elementary a situation as a T-maze leaves the cognitive definition of the alternatives unspecified. For example, are the two alternatives「go left」or「go right」? Or are they「go to the same place as last time」or「go to the other place」? The classic Bush-Mosteller-Estes model of learning in two-choice situations (Bush and Mosteller, 1955) predicts quite different learning patterns depending on the definition of the alternatives if the reward schedule alternates rewards on the two alternatives (Lave and March, 1975).

The intellect (cognitive) component becomes even more obvious when discussions of replication turn to issues concerning the generalization of learning to situations that are not identical to those in which previous experience has occurred but might be imagined to be, in some sense, similar (Winter 2009).「Similarity」can be provided a somewhat objective meaning in experimental settings; but in the real world it becomes a mental construct of considerable indeterminacy. Issues such as these are, for the most part, ignored in the discussion below.

The paradigmatic situation for the replication of success is one in which a choice is made repeatedly among a number of alternatives. The alternatives might be actions, strategies, products, technologies, locations, partners, or any number of other mutually exclusive and exhaustive items. In each time period, a particular alternative is chosen and an outcome is experienced. Subsequent choices favor alternatives associated with better past outcomes over alternatives associated with poorer outcomes. The capability generated by the replication of success is contextual. It may generalize to new situations that are, in some sense, similar to the original situation; but there is little reason to expect it necessarily to do so. And the capability reflects no significant element of causal understanding.

A process that simply replicates success is attractive for many reasons. It captures truth without the necessity of articulating it. It is a democratic instrument, being as accessible to the weak as to the powerful, as accessible to the uneducated as to the educated. It is a practical instrument, dealing more with the pragmatic necessities of ordinary life than with the abstract imaginations of ideas and theories. It is a tailored instrument, reflecting considerations in a specific concrete situation by virtue of having been developed in the same context. It is a compelling instrument, mobilizing a sense of personal relevance by its link to success and failure in direct experience.

复制成功的基本观点蕴含在组织研究的一组熟悉观点之中。研究者经常认为，组织比较绩效与目标，如果绩效落后于目标，就启动搜寻，寻求改变（Cyert and March 1963；Greve 2003；Baum and Dahlin 2007）。因此，组织更可能复制与成功相连的行动而非与失败相连的行动。

复制成功雅在简单，其过程可以用三句话说清楚：1）从所有可选行动中选择一个付诸实施；2）记录结果，评定成败；3）复制与成功相连的行动，回避与失败相连的行动。

同与好结果相连的实务、形式和规则相比，与好结果相连的实务、形式和规则存活时间更长、繁衍机会更多。

应该指出的一点是，把复制成功说成低智的（或非认知的），具有潜在的误导性。这种说法忽略了适应过程的认知复杂性。例如，在经典的二选一学习任务中，学习者在两个相互排斥、相互竞争的选项中反复选择多次。如果总是对其中一个选项进行奖励，那么学习者一般就学会了选择那个选项。然而，连简单如 T 形迷宫那样的情境，也无法在认知上明确地定义选项。例如，这两个选项是「向左」或「向右」，还是「跟上次一样」或「跟上次相反」？描述二选一学习情境的经典 Bush-Mosteller-Estes 模型（Bush and Mosteller，1955）预言，如果时而奖励这个选项、时而奖励那个选项，那么学习情况就会因选项认知定义的不同而大相径庭（Lave and March，1975）。

在讨论到把规律推广到相似情境这一话题时，复制成功的智慧（认知）成分变得更加明显（Winter 2009）。在实验室条件下，可以对「相似性」进行相对客观的定义，但是，在现实世界中，「相似性」是一个相当模糊的概念。下面的讨论，大都忽略诸如此类的问题。

复制成功的范式情境是，在数个选项中反复选择多次。选项可以是行动、战略、产品、技术、地点、合作伙伴等等，其数目可以是两个或两个以上，各选项相互排斥、相互竞争。每次选择一个选项，体验一个结果。以后的选择青睐与较好结果相连的选项，轻视与较差结果相连的选项。通过复制成功而形成的能力具有情境特殊性，也许可以推广到在某种意义上与原始情境类似的新情境，而且，这种能力是知其然而不知其所以然。

复制成功之所以有吸引力，原因有很多。它能抓住事物的本质，尽管并不一定能表达出来。它是一个民主的工具，强者能用，弱者也能用。它是一个实用的工具，处理的多是日常生活中的实际问题而非抽象的理论问题。它是一个量身定做的工具，在什么情境下应用，就在什么情境下开发。它是一个颇具震撼力的工具，用这个工具学习，直接体验成与败，无法不投入。

#### 2.2.1 三种机制

Three Mechanisms

The replication of success may occur in a number of different ways. In particular, we consider three classic mechanisms. The three mechanisms differ in important ways, but they also share common structural features that are significant.

The first mechanism is trial-and-error learning. Learning replicates success by modifying rules so as to repeat successful actions more readily than unsuccessful actions. The paradigmatic experiential trial-and-error learning situation involves a set of alternatives with associated outcome distributions and a learning rule that modifies actions as a result of realized outcomes. There are two enormous literatures dealing with trial-and-error learning. The first is the literature on so-called bandit problems in operations research (Gittins 1989). A bandit problem is one involving sequential choices among a collection of alternatives with unknown payoff distributions. Information about a specific alternative can be obtained only by choosing it. The usual objective of the research on bandit problems is to find an optimal strategy for engaging such situations, or at least a strategy that is better than other known ones. The key strategic question is whether to select the apparently best alternative (on the basis of experience to date) or to sample alternatives further in order to gather more information. In general, the research on bandit problems indicates that optimal strategies depend on the time horizon chosen. The longer the time horizon, the more advantageous is the expanded sampling of unknown or apparently inferior alternatives.

The second enormous literature on trial-and-error learning deals with reinforcement learning in a T-maze (Mowrer and Klein 2001; Lovie 2005). The objective of the research is to understand animal and human learning in simple choice situations under various conditions of reward, and to model that learning. In general, the research indicates that learners characteristically improve performance as experience increases but that there are numerous situations in which choices that are made do not conform to what appears to be optimal behavior. For example, consider a situation in which there are two alternatives with probabilities of reward unknown to the learner but one with a probability p1 of reward and the other with a probability p2 < p1 of reward. Many experiments of this sort have been run, leading to numerous attempts to confirm or disconfirm expected utility hypotheses about human behavior or specify the conditions under which they hold. For example, if the outcome for each alternative on each trial is revealed regardless of which alternative is chosen, an expected utility-maximizing learner would adopt a strategy of always choosing the more frequently rewarded alternative. Such a result is not always observed.

The second mechanism for replicating success is imitation. Imitation replicates success by having actions associated with success when executed by one actor imitated by another actor. Replication through imitation probably represents the majority of what is normally called「innovation」in the organizations literature (Mansfield 1961; Mahajan and Wind 1986). The ways in which known attributes and processes spread within a population of organizations have been studied extensively in research on innovation and change in organizations (Reinganum 1989; Haunschild and Miner 1997). The empirical study of imitation is complicated by the difficulty of distinguishing the aggregate results of a diffusion process from the often similar aggregate results of the independent adoption of a practice, product, or form in a heterogeneous population (Gray 1973; Volden, Ting, and Carpenter 2008). There seems little doubt, however, that imitation is often involved in the replication of success (Holden 1986; Conell and Cohn 1995).

The idea that things spread among organizations is well known in discussions of fashion and fads (Abrahamson 1991; Newell, Swan, and Kautz 2001; Kieser 2002), contagion (Burt 1987; Galaskiewiecz and Burt 1991; Strang and Soule 1998), and institutionalization (Zucker 1987; Bergevärn, Mellemvik, and Olson 1998; Scott 2003; Greenwood and Suddaby 2006). Studies of imitation emphasize the ways in which the successful actions of one actor are replicated in the actions of another (Miller and Dollard 1941; Nehaniv and Dautenhahn 2007) and the ways in which networks of associations affect the spread of ideas, beliefs, routines, or actions through a population (Podolny, Stuart, and Hannan 1996; Powell, Koput, and Smith-Doerr, 1996; Uzzi 1996).

Studies of replication through imitation build on standard epidemiological representations that assume the following (Bartholomew 1982):

(1) a set of alternatives with associated outcome distributions;

(2) a direct contact matrix that indicates the direct contacts for each actor; and

(3) a contagion rule that defines the likelihood of actor i imitating actor j at time t.

The prototypic models examine the replication of the behavior of the successful who are connected (Granovetter and Soong 1983; Strang and Soule 1998). The results depend on properties of the「donor」and the「recipient,」properties of the「disease,」and properties of the structure of linkage. In general, diffusion processes often exhibit threshold effects (Schelling 1971; Gladwell 2000), and they more reliably yield convergence (but see Greenwood and Suddaby 2006; Purdy and Gray 2009) than they do optimality (Strang and Macy, 2001). The effectiveness of imitation in finding optimal solutions depends on the structure of connections among learners; but it is not, in general, true that effectiveness increases monotonically with the density of connections.

Simple epidemiological conceptions embrace two assumptions that are particularly problematic when applied to replication among organizations. The first problematic assumption is that an object of diffusion is invariant as it diffuses. Studies of the spread of things among organizations indicate that the object of diffusion often is transformed as it is transferred from one organization to another (Czarniawska and Sevón 1996; Scott 2003). In fact, the ability to copy exactly is sometimes described as an essential feature of effective replication in organizations (Winter 2009). The second problematic assumption is that the links among adopters are unchanged by the process. In populations of organizations, the connections themselves are likely to be affected by the history of the diffusion process. In particular, an instance of imitation is likely to strengthen the linkage through which the imitation occurs (March 1999a).

The third mechanism for replication of success is selection. Selection replicates success by reproducing attributes (e.g., rules, routines, forms) associated with success and eliminating attributes associated with failure. Theories of replication through selection assume a set of fixed attributes, a selection rule that determines survival among the attributes, and replication rules that determine the reproduction of attributes. In the organizational versions of replication through selection, the elimination of attributes depends on relative performance within a group of competitors, and successful attributes are replicated more often than unsuccessful ones (Alchian 1950; Winter 1964; Baum and Singh 1994).

These ideas, of course, draw upon other enormous literatures in evolutionary biology and evolutionary economics (Mayr 1963, 1982; Selten 1991; Gould 2002; Nelson and Winter 2002; Witt 2003). They posit various forms of variation in attributes and various processes of selection among them. The results depend on the specific forms taken by variation and selection and the nature of competition. The processes are generally slow relative to the changes in the environment to which they respond; and they often have multiple equilibria, not all of them equally attractive.

复制成功的方式有很多，这里将专门具体讨论三种经典机制。这三种机制在很多方面是不同的，但在结构上具有一些明显的共同点。

第一种机制是试误（trial-and-error）。所谓试误，就是亲自摸索、不断尝试，观察结果，复制与成功相连的行动，回避与失败相连的行动。试误的范式情境包含一组选项和一个学习规则，每个选项有一个结果分布，学习规则描述的是如何根据过去的结果修改未来的行动。研究试误的文献有两大块。第一块是运筹学中所谓的「老虎机问题」（bandit problem）研究（Gittins 1989）。在老虎机问题中，各选项的结果分布是未知的，学习者可以通过选择某个选项并付诸实施来了解这个选项。老虎机问题研究的常见目标是找出处理这一问题的最佳策略，或者，至少是比其他已知策略都好的策略。关键的策略问题是，是选择表面上的最佳选项（根据历次经验）还是抽取几个选项进行尝试以收集更多的信息。老虎机问题研究表明，一般而言，最佳策略取决于时间范围。时间范围越长，抽取未知选项或表面上的差选项进行尝试以收集更多信息的策略越好。

第二块文献是教育心理学中的 T 形迷宫强化学习研究（Mowrer and Klein 2001；Lovie 2005）。这些研究的目标是，理解简单选择情境下人类和动物在各种奖励条件下的学习情况。T 形迷宫强化学习研究表明，一般而言，随着经验的增长，学习者的绩效会改进，但是，在有些情境下，学习者做出的选择，并不符合表面上的最佳策略。例如，假设有两个选项，学习者不知道两个选项的结果分布，只知道选项 1 获得奖励的可能性大于选项 2。很多人做过这种实验，企图证实或证伪有关人类行为的期望效用假设，或者企图指出期望效用假设成立的具体条件。例如，如果每次尝试不管选择哪个选项都能知道每个选项的结果，那么希望最大化期望效用的学习者采取的策略就是总是选择比较经常获得奖励的那个选项。但是，并非所有的实验都观察到这个现象。

复制成功的第二种机制是模仿（imitation）。所谓模仿，就是观察其他行动者的经验，其他行动者采取什么行动获得了成功，那就采取什么行动，其他行动者采取什么行动遭受了失败，那就回避什么行动。组织文献中所说的「创新」（innovation）（Mansfield 1961；Mahajan and Wind 1986），大多都是通过模仿复制成功。很多组织创新与变革研究考察了属性和流程在组织群的传播方式（Reinganum 1989；Haunschild and Miner 1997）。有关模仿的实证研究是比较复杂的，因为在异质群体中，效仿别人采用某个实务、产品或形式，独立自主采用某个实务、产品或形式，两者的效应是很难区分开来的（Gray 1973；Volden，Ting，and Carpenter 2008）。然而，有一点似乎毫无疑问，那就是复制成功往往涉及模仿（Holden 1986；Conell and Cohn 1995）。

「事物在组织之间传播」的观点，在有关时尚的讨论中（Abrahamson 1991；Newell，Swan，and Kautz 2001；Kieser 2002），在有关制度化的讨论中（Zucker 1987；Bergevam，Mellemvik，and Olsen 1998；Scott 2003；Greenwood and Suddaby 2006），经常可以看到。模仿研究强调行动者是如何复制其他行动者的成功行动的（Miller and Dollard 1941；Nehaniv and Dautenhahn 2007），还强调联系网络是如何影响想法、信念、程序或行动在群体内的传播的（Podolny，Stuart，and Hannan 1996；Powell，Koput，and Smith-Doerr，1996；Uzzi 1996）。

有关通过模仿复制成功的研究，借鉴了流行病传播学的一套假定（Bartholomew 1982）：1）一组选项，每个选项有一个结果分布；2）一个联系网络，描述每个行动者之间或直接或间接的联系；3）一条传染规则，定义行动者 i 在时间 t 模仿行动者 j 的可能性。

这一原型模型可以用来考察成功的人或组织的行为是如何在与其有联系的人群或组织群中传播的（Granovetter and Soong 1983；Strang and Soule 1998）。最终状态取决于「供体」的性质、「受体」的性质、「疾病」的性质和联系网络的性质。一般而言，传播过程经常出现识阈效应（threshold effect）（Schelling 1971；Gladwell 2000），而且最后多以趋同（convergence）（Greenwood and Suddaby 2006；Purdy and Gray 2009）而非最优（optimality）（Strang and Macy 2001）收尾。通过模仿能否找到最优解，取决于学习者之间的联系网络，但是，一般而言，找到最优解的可能性并非随着联系密度单调递增。

流行病传播学有两条假定，放在组织复制成功的情境下尤其不合适。第一条假定是，传播物在传播过程中保持不变。有关事物在组织之间传播的研究表明，传播物在从一个组织传到另外一个组织的过程中往往会发生变化（Czamiawska and Sevon 1996；Scott 2003）。实际上，精确模仿能力有时被说成是组织有效复制成功的必要特征（Winter 2009）。第二条假定是，联系网络在传播过程中保持不变。在组织群中，联系网络本身会受到传播过程的影响。特别是模仿发生之时，模仿者与被模仿者之间的联系强于平时（March 1999a）。

复制成功的第三个机制是天择（selection）。所谓天择，就是繁殖与成功相连的属性（例如，规则、程序、形式），淘汰与失败相连的属性。通过天择复制成功的理论假定，存在一组固定属性、一条天择规则、一条繁殖规则，天择规则决定繁殖哪些属性，繁殖规则决定如何繁殖那些属性。对于组织通过天择复制成功而言，淘汰哪些属性，取决于一群竞争者之间的相对绩效，成功者的属性比失败者的属性更可能被复制（Alchian 1950；Winter 1964；Baum and Singh 1994）。当然，这些观点借鉴了进化生物学和进化经济学的大量文献（Mayr 1963，1982；Selten 1991；Gould 2002；Nelson and Winter 2002；Witt 2003）。它们设想出多种多样的变异形式和多种多样的天择过程。最终状态取决于具体采用了哪种变异形式、哪种天择过程，还取决于竞争的性质。相对于所处环境的变化而言，传播过程一般是缓慢的；而且，传播过程往往具有多重均衡，并不是每重均衡都同样有吸引力。

#### 2.2.2 两组问题

Two Sets of Questions

The literature on processes of adaptation that replicate success addresses two related, but different, sets of questions.

The first set includes: What do individuals or organizations do in this situation? How do they act? How do their actions change over time as a result of experience? To what extent, in what way, and at what rate do they respond to knowledge of experienced results? To what extent do they learn to pursue the best alternative?

The second set of questions includes: What should an intelligent person or organization do in this situation? How long should several alternatives be sampled in order to obtain information about them? When should a choice be made and on what basis?

With respect to the second set of questions, mechanisms for the replication of success share a fundamental problem that is also conspicuous in calculative rationality — indeed, in all adaptive processes: How do they recognize and achieve an optimal balance between exploitation and exploration? (See Kuhn 1962, 1977; Holland 1975; March 1999c, chap. 7; Chen and Katila 2008; Fang and Levinthal 2009.) Exploitation refers to the utilization and refinement of what is known. It is reflected in efforts toward efficiency, standardization, accountability, and control. Exploration is the pursuit of what is not known. It is reflected in efforts to generate and experiment with deviant procedures and new possibilities. In processes involving the replication of success, the problem is typically a problem of allocating resources between efforts to learn more about the world (exploration) and efforts to take advantage of what is already known (exploitation). A frequent question about the replication of success is whether, as it responds to immediate feedback, it allocates too few resources to exploration (Starbuck, Greve, and Hedberg 1978; Miller 1994).

There are some obvious criteria that can be applied to evaluate the effect of replicating success on any particular set of rules for action:

Improvement: Does average performance improve with experience?

Stability: Does the likelihood that a choice at time t repeats the choice at t-1 increase with experience?

Reputation error: Is the past realized performance (reputation) of the chosen alternative greater or less than its expected value? How does the error change with time?

Optimality: Is the best alternative discovered and adopted? How long does it take? Or alternatively, how close is the chosen alternative to the optimum in expected performance over time?

有关通过复制成功适应环境的文献，处理了两组相互联系但是有所不同的问题。

第一组问题包括：个人或组织在这种情境下怎么做？个人和组织如何行动？随着时间的推移，个人或组织的行为如何根据经验而改变？个人和组织以何种方式、什么速度根据经验改变行动到什么程度？个人和组织在多大程度上追求最佳选项？

第二组问题包括：智慧的个人或组织在这种情境下应该怎么做？为了收集更多信息而抽取几个选项进行尝试，这种尝试应该持续多长时间？什么时候应该做出选择？应该基于什么做出选择？

说到第二组问题，复制成功的各种机制具有一个共同的根本问题，这个根本问题在计算理性中的表现也很明显 —— 确实，在各种适应过程中的表现都很明显。这个问题就是：如何指出并实现开发与探索之间的最佳平衡（Kuhn 1962，1977；Holland 1975；March 1999c，第 7 章；Chen and Katila 2008；Fang and Levinthal 2009）。开发指利用并精练已知之物，提高效率、进行标准化、实行问责、施加控制 —— 这些都是开发的表现。探索指追求未知之物，尝试不同于标准流程的新做法，就是探索的表现。在涉及复制成功的适应过程中，问题就变成了如何在进一步了解世界（探索）和利用已知之物（开发）之间分配资源。因为复制成功是对即时反馈做出反应，所以复制成功经常遭受的一个质疑是：分配到探索上的资源是否太少（Starbuck，Greve，and Hedberg 1978；Miller 1994）。

有些显而易见的标准可以用来评价复制成功对任何一组特定行动规则的效应：1）改进（improvement）：平均绩效随着经验而改进吗？2）稳定（stability）：第 t 次重复第 t-1 次选择的可能性随着经验而增加吗？3）声誉误差（reputation error）：所选选项变现绩效（声誉）是大于还是小于其期望值？两者的差距如何随着时间而变化？4）最优性（optimality）：发现并采用了最佳选项吗？花了多长时间才找到最佳选项？或者，所选选项的绩效与最佳期望绩效的差距如何随着时间而变化？

### 2.3 复制成功的问题

COMPLICATIONS IN SUCCESS REPLICATION

Trial-and-error learning, imitation, and selection have different properties as adaptive mechanisms, but they have a set of basic structural elements in common. These shared elements and the complications they create are the primary foci of the present discussion. For the most part, the phenomena considered here stem from properties of the learning environment and the adaptive mechanisms, not from any distinctive features of the cognitive apparatus that may be brought to bear on them. Thus they are different from, and substantially independent of, well-known cognitive limitations of individuals. These「structural」complications can be understood, but an understanding of the complications by an adaptive agent does not eliminate the difficulties.

First, history is complex. Even though the world may be orderly in the sense of following immutable laws, it is filled with complex causal relations. Forming correct inferences about history in the face of such complexity requires a complicated experimental design, a multivariate model, and a large sample. Unfortunately, the conditions underlying the replication of success in real experience include simple implicit experimental designs, simple implicit correlational models, and small samples. As a result, the replication of success is subject to extensive elements of misspecification and superstition.

Second, history is subject to stochastic uncertainty. The orderliness of the world is obscured by probabilistic variations. Identifying the best alternative through experience involves untangling the joint consequences of signal, noise, and sample size. Signal: The greater the true differences among alternatives, the greater the chance of identifying the true optimum by observing a sample. Noise: The smaller the stochastic variation in the observed outcomes, the greater the chance of identifying the true optimum by observing a sample. Sample size: The larger the sample, the greater the chance of identifying the true optimum by observing a sample.

Since experience in organizations often suffers from weak signals, substantial noise, and small samples, it is quite likely that realized history will deviate considerably from the underlying reality. Adaptation responds, not to the distribution of potential histories but to the specific history realized in a small sample. The results may lead to a more favorable experience with an alternative than is warranted, thus leading to a mistaken replication. Alternatively, the results may lead to a less favorable experience than is warranted, thus leading to a mistaken avoidance of replication.

As is well known to students of stochastic processes, stochastic variation produces some quite striking, counterintuitive surprises (Feller 1968). Many of these surprises are variations on so-called first-passage theorems or competitive maximum theorems. An example of the former is the case of coin flips: If a single fair coin is flipped a large number of times, what is the distribution of length of runs in which more than half of the results are heads? The usual intuition is that a fair coin should lead to relatively short runs of dominance by either heads or tails; the actual result is that the runs are, on average, rather long.

An example of competitive maximum theorems is provided by comparing two identical competitors, each of whom realizes each period a draw from a normal distribution with mean=0 and variance=1. Suppose we consider the average realized performance of the two competitors over time. As experience accumulates, the likelihood increases that the competitor with the greater average realized return at time t will also have the greater average realized return at t+1. That likelihood becomes quite high as t increases. The rankings of two competitors, in terms of average performance to date, persist for an extended time even though the two are identical in capabilities and even though the difference in average performance declines.

Third, the outcome possibilities for the various alternatives are affected by the sequence of choices made and the outcomes realized. Replication of success naturally affects the alternative chosen and thus the distribution of possibilities from which an outcome is drawn. Less obviously, it also often affects the distribution of possibilities for a given alternative. In standard terminology, the individual outcome distributions are endogenous to the choice or the realized outcome.

Some of the endogeneities can be characterized as cases of depletion: that is, the replication of success results, on average, in a lower performance because the replication itself is detrimental to subsequent outcomes. The most obvious cases involve resources that are depleted by use or competition. Other cases involve the corrosion of advantage through exploiting it (Barnett and Hansen 1996). Suppose, for example, that a tennis player follows a strategy of hitting the ball to the weaker side of his or her opponents, thus increasing the short-run prospects of victory but at the same time providing more practice for opponents in using their weaker hands than in using the stronger. Over time, practice effects will reduce the differences in competence between the two hands of competitors and thus reduce the competitive advantage of hitting to the weaker side. Other examples include cases of boredom or cynicism. Still others involve the adjustments of others, as for example when crying wolf changes the longer-run likelihood of a response to the cry.

Of possibly even greater importance, however, are cases involving outcome distributions that are augmented by use — where the replication itself improves the outcome distribution. An important case involves the effect of practice on performance. Each time a given alternative is chosen, its capability improves. It seems reasonable to assume that, typically, the effect of practice is to increase the mean and decrease the variance of the outcome distribution for the chosen alternative.

Practice effects complicate the use of success replication in finding an optimum choice. This complication is usually described in terms of「competency traps」(Levitt and March 1988; Arthur 1989). Suppose performance in a particular activity is a product of a fixed potential for the activity and a variable level of competence at it. Competence is characteristically low initially but increases through practice. Since performance reflects the product of competence and potential, practice effects make identification of the alternative with the highest potential more difficult than it would be in the absence of practice effects. It is quite possible that an alternative of lower potential will come to dominate one of greater potential by virtue of greater current competence on the former. This is particularly likely when comparing an existing inferior alternative at which an organization has a prolonged history of practice with a new superior alternative with which the organization is relatively inexperienced. Replication of success is more likely to aggravate this problem than to ameliorate it.

Similarly, if success makes subsequent success more likely, as in the「Matthew Effect」(Merton 1968), outcome distributions are endogenous to choices. Suppose, for example, that realized performance at time t, rt, is a draw from a normal distribution with mean=xt and standard deviation=st. If xt is a function of rt-1 (for example, xt=rt-1) the process takes on martingale characteristics, with the result that small initial differences among alternatives are converted, over time, into large differences. An obvious organizational example is the way in which evaluations of early performance influence evaluations of subsequent performance so that small initial variability in evaluations of personnel becomes large variability. A related example is found in the way that the likelihood of imitation of a particular practice depends on its「legitimacy,」which in turn depends on the number of others who have already adopted the practice (Carroll and Hannan 1989; Hannan 1998).

The replication of success is also affected by the definition of success in terms of a relation to aspirations and the ways in which aspirations are affected by achievements (Payne, Laughhann, and Crum 1980, 1981). Suppose the aspiration level at time t is a mix between aspiration at t-1 and performance at t-1. Thus, aspiration tends to track performance (is, in fact, an exponentially weighted moving average of performance) and essentially discounts current performance by a positive function of past performance. This makes subjective success or subjective failure particularly sensitive to noise in outcome determination. By making success (and thus the replications of success) depend on the history of past performances, adaptive aspirations tend to slow learning, especially if the rate of aspiration adjustment is rapid (March and Shapira 1992). On the other hand, if aspirations do not adjust to experience, so that success or failure tends to be stable, learning can become superstitious (Lave and March 1975).

Thus there are three simultaneous elements of learning. The first is learning what to do: looking for a good (or best) alternative technology, strategy, partner, etc. The second is learning how to do it: refining and improving competence with an alternative. The third is learning what to hope for: modifying the aspiration level for performance. The simultaneous adaptation of these three elements complicates the effectiveness of locating the best alternative. Adaptiveness in making a technology work and adaptiveness in aspirations interfere with adaptiveness in choosing a superior technology.

Fourth, sampling rates of experience are affected by sample outcomes. Experience in a particular time period can be seen as a draw from the distribution of possible outcomes associated with an alternative. Any particular experience is likely to be misleading to the extent to which there is variation in possible outcomes; and small samples of experience will have greater sampling error than will larger samples. The repetition of alternatives associated with success and the avoidance of alternatives associated with failure assure that the sample size of experience with successful alternatives will be larger than the sample size of experience with unsuccessful alternatives. As a result, the sampling error associated with unsuccessful alternatives will be larger than the sampling error associated with successful alternatives.

Two types of errors in experiential learning stem from sampling errors. The first is the error produced when a sample of experience has unrepresentative high returns. The second is the error produced when a sample of experience has unrepresentative low returns. Since the sample size of successful alternatives is increased by the repetition of success, the errors made by overestimating the value of an alternative tend to be self-correcting. Repetition reduces the sampling error associated with experience with a successful alternative, thus exposing errors of overestimation. On the other hand, errors made by underestimating the value of an alternative are not self-correcting. Alternatives that are better than their early results will tend to be persistently underrated and underchosen.

Some of the phenomena can be illustrated by a simple model, as long as it is recognized to be a very stylized representation. Suppose a choice is made each time period among a set of fifty alternatives. Each alternative (Ai) is characterized by a normal outcome distribution with a mean=xi and a standard deviation=s. The xi’s and s are fixed over time. The xi’s are themselves draws from a normal distribution with a mean=0 and a standard distribution=S. Each alternative has an initial reputation, Ri,0=0, the mean expectation within the population of alternatives. Subsequently, the value of Ri,t for each chosen alternative equals the mean realization associated with a choice of that alternative. Thus, reputations at t may be based on as few as zero observations or as many as t-1. Each time period the alternative with the highest reputation, max Ri,t, is chosen and an outcome realized (a draw from the distribution for that alternative).

The properties of this simple model illustrate the consequences of the endogenous sampling rate. Improvement: When the alternatives have different means (S>0), the replication of success improves performance over time. Better alternatives are discovered and replicated. Stability: There is a strong tendency for the replication of success to become very stable in its choice of alternatives. This result occurs, though with less force, even when there are no differences among the alternatives (S=0). Reputation error: The difference between the reputation of the chosen alternative and the true mean of the outcome distribution for that alternative (Ri,t-xi) is positive — that is, reputations of chosen alternatives overestimate capabilities. The error is large initially but declines over time, ultimately (after a very large number of periods) approaching zero. Optimality: If we compute the ratio between the mean of the chosen alternative and the mean of the best possible alternative among the fifty alternatives where S>0, the mean fraction of the optimum that the process realizes increases over time, but it falls far short of 1.0. The process rarely discovers the optimum.

A mixed story. The result is a mixed story. In simple situations where the causal structure is not complicated, replication of success frequently leads to improvement in performance over time if there are differences among the alternatives, their outcomes are relatively reliable (low variance), and an adequate sample of experience is obtained. Replication of success usually leads to stability, a steady increase in the likelihood of repeating a choice. It usually leads to improved reputation (past performance) of chosen alternatives for an extended period. Part of the improvement in reputation is due to the likelihood of choosing a better alternative, but part of it is due to selection of positive sampling error.

On the other hand, learning through the replication of success has troubling unfavorable properties. Even in simple situations, the choices made through replication of success are very likely to be substantially suboptimal. The replication of success at one level of learning confounds the replication of success at another level, producing, for example, competency traps. Even though the deviation of average performance from the expected value of the alternative ultimately approaches zero, for an extended period the realized performance of the chosen alternative reflects a substantial overestimation of that alternative’s potential. Even when there are no differences among the alternatives (and thus nothing to learn in terms of having a preference among them), replication of success usually leads to increased stability of choice. The subjective sense of learning is likely to be profound even when there is nothing to be learned.

A striking feature of these results is the extent to which they depend less on attributes of the learner than on attributes of experience. When experience unfolds in a way that makes learning effective, intelligence is augmented by the replication of success. But when experience is organized, as it often is, by complexity, ambiguity, stochastic variability, and limited sample sizes, the replication of success — whether through trial-and-error learning, imitation, or selection — is likely to lead to suboptimal outcomes.

作为适应机制，试误、模仿和天择有不同之处，但是在结构上有一些基本共同点。这些基本共同点及其引起的问题是本节讨论的主要焦点。此处讨论的现象，大都源自学习环境和适应机制的性质，而不是源自学习者的认知习惯，因此与那些著名的人类信息加工局限是不同的、基本上无关的。这些「结构性」问题是可以理解的，但是，理解了这些问题，并不代表就能解决这些问题。

第一，历史是复杂的。世界遵循一些永恒规律，从这个意义上说，世界也许是井然有序的，即使如此，世界还是充满复杂的因果关系。面对这样的复杂性，要从经验当中做出正确的推断，就要采用复杂的实验设计、使用多变量模型，还要使用大样本。不幸的是，在现实世界中复制成功，只能采用简单的内隐实验设计、简单的内隐相关模型和小样本。结果，通过复制成功而学习，特别容易犯下误设（misspecification）和迷信（superstition）的错误。

第二，历史充满随机不确定性。世界的井然有序掺杂着随机变异。根据经验找出最佳选项，就要解析信号、噪声和样本量的联合效应。

信号：选项之间的真实差异越大，通过观察一个样本找出真实最佳选项的机会越大。

噪声：观察结果的随机变异越小，通过观察一个样本找出真实最佳选项的机会越大。

样本量：样本越大，通过观察一个样本找出真实最佳选项的机会越大。

既然组织中的经验经常是信号弱、噪声大、样本小，那么变现历史就极有可能大大偏离深层现实。适应不是响应潜在历史分布，而是响应小样本实现的那个历史。这会导致过分偏爱一个其实并非很好的选项，进而导致错误地复制，或者导致过分轻视一个其实并非很差的选项，进而导致错误地回避。

研究随机过程的学者都知道，随机变异会造成一些十分惊人、违反直觉的意外（Feller 1968）。这些意外，很多是所谓的首次超越定理（first-passagetheorem），或者竞争上限定理（competitive maximum theorem）的变式。前者的一个例子是抛掷硬币：抛掷一枚硬币，大概抛掷多少次会半数以上是正面或者半数以上是反面？一般人的直觉是，次数较少。而实际情况是，平均而言，次数相当多。

竞争上限定理的一个例子是：比较两个相同的竞争者，每个竞争者每次实现的绩效，取自一个平均值为 0、标准差为 1 的正态分布。假设我们考虑两个竞争者历次变现绩效的平均值。随着经验的积累，第 t 次的历次变现绩效平均值较大的竞争者，第 t＋1 次的历次变现绩效平均值也较大的可能性会增大。随着 t 的不断增加，这一可能性会变得非常大。根据历次变现绩效平均值对两个竞争者排名，这一排名会在很长一段时间内保持不变，即使两个竞争者在能力上是一样的，即使平均绩效之差会缩小。

第三，众选项的潜在结果分布受到历次所做选择以及历次变现结果的影响。复制成功自然会影响所选选项，进而影响所选选项的潜在结果分布。不那么显而易见的是，复制成功经常还会影响其他选项的潜在结果分布。用标准术语来说，每次的潜在结果分布内源于历次所做选择或历次变现结果。

这种内源性在有些案例中表现为消耗：也就是因为复制本身对后续结果有害，所以，平均而言，复制成功导致绩效降低。最显而易见的案例涉及，资源因使用或竞争而消耗。其他案例涉及，优势因开发而丧失（Barnett and Hansen 1996）。例如，假设一位网球选手采取的策略是把球打到对手较弱的那边（对手长于右手，就打到左边；对手长于左手，就打到右边）。这一策略会增加短期获胜的可能性，但是与此同时会为对手提供练习较弱那边的机会。随着时间的推移，练习效应会减小对手两手之间的能力差异，进而减弱「把球打到对手较弱那边」这个策略的竞争优势。其他例子包括，涉及厌倦或愤世嫉俗的案例。还有一些例子是涉及他人调整的案例，例如，喊「狼来了」的次数多了，别人就不把你的喊叫当回事了。

然而，也许更为重要的案例涉及的是结果分布因使用而改进 —— 复制本身改进结果分布。一个重要的案例涉及，熟能生巧。每次选择一个选项，就会提高在这个选项上的能力。我们似乎有理由假定，一般而言，练习效应会增大所选选项结果分布的平均值、减小所选选项结果分布的标准差。

因为练习效应的存在，所以通过复制成功寻找最佳选项容易出现问题。这个问题一般称作「胜任力陷阱（competency traps）」（Levitt and March 1988；Arthur 1989）。假设某项活动的绩效是由这项活动的潜力和在这项活动上的胜任力共同决定的，潜力是固定的，胜任力是变化的。一般而言，胜任力起初较低，但随着练习而提高。既然绩效是由胜任力和潜力共同决定的，那么有了练习效应就更难找出最具潜力的选项。极有可能，一个潜力较低的选项会因为学习者比较擅长而胜过一个潜力较高的选项。组织经常会面临一种选择：一个是老做法（或流程、形式），缺点较多，但是用顺手了；另外一个是新做法（或流程、形式），优点较多，但是不大会用。在这两个选项面前，组织极有可能选择前者。复制成功更有可能加重而非缓解这一问题。

类似的，如果成功带来更多的成功，如马太效应（Merton 1968）那样，那么结果分布就内源于选择。例如，假设第 t 次的变现绩效 rt 取自平均值为 xt、标准差为 st 的正态分布，如果 xt 是 rt-1 的函数（例如，xt＝rt-1），那么过程就会呈现弓形拉线特点，也就是选项结果间差异起初较小，后来越变越大。这种情况在组织中的一个显而易见的例子是早期绩效评价影响后续绩效评价，这样下去，起初很小的绩效评价个体差异会越拉越大。还有一个相关的例子，那就是模仿某项实务的可能性取决于这项实务的「合法性（legitimacy）」，而合法性又取决于已经有多少组织采用了这项实务（Carroll and Hannan 1989；Hannan 1998）。

复制成功还受成败评定（拿绩效与目标相比）以及目标调整（根据绩效调整目标）的影响（Payne，Laughhann，and Crum 1980，1981）。假设第 t 次的目标取决于第 t-1 次的目标和第 t-1 次的绩效。这样，目标就会向绩效靠拢（实际上，是以指数级速度趋近平均绩效），而且，过去绩效较低，目标就会调低，当前绩效必然也会降低。这让成败判定特别容易受到结果噪声的影响。通过让成功（进而复制成功）取决于绩效史，目标调整会放缓学习进程，尤其是当目标调整速度很快的时候（March and Shapira 1992）。另一方面，如果目标不随经验而调整，成败趋于稳定，那么学习就可能变成迷信活动（Lave and March 1975）。

学习在三个层面同时发生。第一个是学习做什么：寻找好的（或者最好的）技术、战略或合作伙伴，等等。第二个是学习如何做：精练并改进在某技术、战略或合作伙伴上的胜任力。第三个是学习期盼什么：调整绩效目标。因为学习在这三个层面同步进行，所以最佳选项更难找到了。在学习选择较好技术的同时，还要学习如何让这项技术发挥作用、如何调整对这项技术的期望值，三个层面的适应相互干扰。

第四，经验抽样率受样本结果的影响。选择一个选项付诸实施观察结果就获得一次经验，每次的经验都是深层现实的一个抽样值，与深层现实存在误差。样本越小，抽样误差越大，复制与成功相连的选项，回避与失败相连的选项，成功选项的经验样本量就会大于失败选项的经验样本量，进而，失败选项的经验抽样误差就会大于成功选项的经验抽样误差。

抽样误差导致体验式学习容易出现两类错误。第一类错误发生在抽样回报高于真实回报之时，第二类错误发生在抽样回报低于真实回报之时。既然成功选项的经验样本量因复制成功而增加，那么因高估选项价值而造成的误差就会自行矫正。复制会减小成功选项的经验抽样误差，进而暴露高估误差。另一方面，因低估选项价值而造成的误差不会自行矫正，初始结果较差的选项容易被低估、被轻视。

有些现象，只要被视作颇具典型性，就可以用一个简单的模型解释清楚。假设在一组 15 个选项中反复选择多次。每个选项 Ai 的结果是一个平均值为 xi、标准差为 s 的正态分布，xi′s 和 s 不随时间而变化，xi′s 本身来自一个平均值为 0、标准差为 S 的正态分布。每个选项有一个初始声誉 Ri,0＝0，就是所有选项的平均期望。随后，每次所选选项的 Ri,t 等于那个选项历次变现结果的平均值。这样，某个选项第 t 次的声誉所依据的观察次数，也许少到只有 0，也许多到有 t-1。每次选择声誉最高（max Ri,t）的那个选项，实现一个结果（取自那个选项的结果分布）。

这一简单模型可以解释内源抽样的后果。改进：当选项平均值之间存在差异（S>0），复制成功会让绩效随着时间而改进，还会找到并复制较好的选项。稳定：复制成功会让选择趋于稳定，而且这种趋势还十分强烈。即使选项平均值之间不存在差异（S＝0），这一趋势还是存在，只是强度稍弱。声誉误差：所选选项声誉与那个选项结果分布真实平均值之间的差异（Ri,t-xi）是正的，也就是所选选项的声誉会高估能力。这一差异起初较大，后来会越变越小，最终（经过很多次选择）趋近于 0。最优性：当选项平均值之间存在差异（S>0），如果计算所选选项平均值与潜在最佳选项平均值之比，那么这一比值会随着时间而增加，但永远不会达到 1.0 复制成功很少会发现最佳选项。最终状态有好有坏。在因果结构并不复杂的简单情境中，如果选项之间存在差异、选项的结果相对稳定（低变异）、经验样本足够大，那么复制成功往往会让绩效随着时间而改进。复制成功往往会导致选择趋于稳定，也就是重复选择某个选项的可能性平稳地增大。复制成功往往会导致一段时间内所选选项的声誉（过去绩效）提高。声誉之所以提高，部分是因为越来越有可能选择较好选项，部分是因为选择了抽样误差为正的选项。

另一方面，通过复制成功而学习也有一些令人讨厌的特点。即使在简单情境下，通过复制成功而做出的选择也极有可能是次优的。某个学习水平的复制成功会与另外一个学习水平的复制成功相互混淆，例如造成胜任力陷阱。即使选项平均绩效与期望值之差最终会趋近于 0，在一段时间内所选选项的变现绩效也会大大低估那个选项的潜力。即使选项之间不存在差异（因此就寻找较好选项而言没有什么可学的），复制成功往往也会导致选择趋于稳定。即使没有什么可学，主观学习感也有可能十分深刻。

这些现象有一个惊人特征，那就是它们在很大程度上取决于经验的属性而非学习者的属性。当经验以让学习有效的方式展开，那么复制成功就会增长智慧。但是，当经验是复杂的、模糊的、充满随机变异的、样本量有限的（情况往往就是如此），那么复制成功 —— 不管是通过试误，还是模仿，或者天择 —— 就有可能导致次优状态。

### 2.4 低智学习与高智解释

LOW-INTELLECT LEARNING AND HIGH-INTELLECT EXPLANATIONS

Although it is flawed in important ways, replication of success is a ubiquitous instrument of learning. In one form or another, and despite its substantial disabilities, it characterizes much of the adaptiveness of human actors. At the same time, however, the low-intellect simplicities of trial-and-error learning, imitation, and selection conflict with high-intellect hopes. Human conceit (both among actors and among observers) often seems to eschew attributions of human behavior to success replication in favor of more complicated, cognitive comprehensions, explanations, and justifications.

The joint ubiquity of success replication and of preferences for high-intellect explications of history and learning suggests the possibility that behavior that is commonly described in high-intellect terms actually may reflect rules learned through low-intellect replications of actions associated with success. It is an old idea, much beloved by Pavlovians and behavioral psychologists and (in a different form) by economic theorists.

Suppose the mechanisms of human behavior are actually much less complicated than the interpretations humans make of human behavior. In particular, suppose it were possible to show that important elements of observed behavior are「explainable」as products of simple success replication. Such a demonstration would hardly prove that success replication is the primary mechanism producing the observed behavior, but it might invite some skepticism toward more elaborate explanations. To illustrate, consider two familiar areas of human inquiry into human behavior: the taking of risks and the choosing of mates.

尽管存在严重缺陷，但是复制成功是一个无所不在的学习工具。人类的适应，一般都是采用各种形式的复制成功。然而，与此同时，试误、模仿、天择的低智简单与人类对高智的希望是相互冲突的。因为自负（行动者和观察者都有），所以人类似乎不愿把自身行为归结为复制成功，而是偏爱比较复杂、比较认知的理解、解释和辩护。

一方面，复制成功无所不在；另一方面，人类偏爱高智历史解释和高智学习，这意味着通常用高智词汇描述的行为有可能实际上只是简单地复制与成功相连的行动，即低智学习。这是一个古老的观点，深受以巴甫洛夫为首的行为主义心理学家的喜爱；这一古老观点的另外一个形式，深受经济理论家的喜爱。

假设人类行为的机制实际上远远没有人类对人类行为的诠释复杂。特别是假设我们可以证明，某些行为「可以解释」为简单地复制成功而得到的产品。这样的证明，几乎证明不了复制成功是产生这些行为的主要机制，但是也许可以促使人们质疑那些比较复杂的解释。下面以人们非常感兴趣、学者经常研究的两种行为为例说明一下：风险承担和配偶选择。

#### 2.4.1 风险承担

Risk Taking

The most common observation (assumption) about risk-taking behavior is that human beings have different risk traits, some of them being risk averse, some risk-seeking. Generally it is assumed that most humans are risk averse. For example, they tend to prefer a certain reward of k dollars to a lottery that offers a probability, p, of receiving k/p dollars and (1-p) of receiving nothing, although the expected value of either alternative is k.

A standard explanation of risk aversion for money is the presumed decreasing marginal utility of money so that the expected utility of a certain alternative is greater than that of a lottery with an equivalent monetary expectation. More generally, in classical theories of rational choice,「risk preference」is defined simply as any nonlinearity in the utility for money.

Studies of risk-taking behavior have suggested that risk taking is not so much an individual trait or a nonlinearity in utility as it is context dependent. The most common characterization is that with respect to alternatives whose expected returns exceed an aspiration level (「gains」), individuals tend to be risk averse, but with respect to alternatives whose expected returns lie below an aspiration level (「losses」), they tend to be risk-seeking (Kahneman and Tversky 1979). This has sometimes been given a「satisficing」interpretation (March and Shapira 1992).

Suppose that risk preference is neither a trait nor immediately context dependent but is the result of learning. It has been shown that simple success replication learning will lead to risk aversion for gains and risk seeking for losses (March 1999c, chap. 15; Denrell 2007). The possible advantages to be reaped from high-variance alternatives in the gains area are poorly assessed by small samples, and those alternatives tend to be abandoned on the basis of poor small sample results. In the loss area, on the other hand, negative results from the low-variance alternatives induce sampling of the high-variance ones.

An important special case of this phenomenon involves learning in cases having very low-probability, extreme outcomes. Very low-probability events result in a highly skewed distribution of the number of occurrences. For example, what happens with respect to a major scientific breakthrough in a laboratory? Such an event is extremely positive, but the chance of its occurring is very small. Most researchers in a laboratory will never experience such an event. In effect (or possibly in fact), most learners will underestimate the likelihood of an extremely rare, positive event. Their resulting actions will be implicitly risk averse, and researchers will fail to replicate the behaviors (e.g., intense commitment and involvement) associated with a great scientific discovery as often as might be justified.

Alternatively, consider what happens in cases involving low-probability, extremely negative consequences. An example would be nuclear accidents in a nuclear power plant. The likelihood is extremely low, so most operators in a nuclear power plant do not experience the event. In effect (or possibly in fact) most learners will underestimate the likelihood of an extremely rare, negative event. Their resulting actions will be implicitly risk-seeking, and they will replicate behaviors (e.g., carelessness) that increase the likelihood of a nuclear accident’s occurring. In such cases, risk aversion for gains and risk seeking for losses would be produced simply by learning.

Notice the difference between the two cases. In the case of the rare, positive event, the failure to experience the event induces individuals to avoid repeating actions (e.g., working diligently on the project) that would make the positive event more likely, thereby not only reducing the chance of correcting the implicit underestimation of its likelihood but also actually making its occurrence less likely. Learning reduces the chance of a major scientific breakthrough. In the case of the rare, negative event, the failure to experience the event induces individuals to repeat actions (e.g., sloppiness, inattention) that make the negative event more likely, thereby not only increasing the chance of correcting the implicit underestimation of its likelihood but also actually making its occurrence more likely. Learning increases the chance of a major nuclear accident,「correcting」the underestimation of the risk both by greater experience with it and by making its occurrence more likely.

In this respect, Beverly Sauer, after reviewing experience with regulations in hazardous environments, observes,「Agencies write standards because experience is a poor teacher」(2003, 37). Sauer explains that constant exposure to danger without its realization leaves human beings less concerned about what once terrified them, and therefore experience can have the paradoxical effect of having people learn to feel more immune than they should to the unlikely dangers that surround them.

说到风险承担行为，最常见的观察（假定）是，不同的人有不同的风险特质，有的人是风险规避型，有的人是风险寻求型。一般而言，大多数人应该是风险规避型。例如，大多数人宁愿稳稳地获得 k 美元，而不愿有 p 的可能性获得 k/p 美元，或者（1-p）的可能性什么也得不到 —— 尽管两个选项的期望值都是 k 美元。

在面对有关金钱的选择时，大多数人规避风险，对该现象的一个标准解释是，因为金钱的边际效用递减，所以确定选项的期望效用大于不确定选项的期望效用。更一般的是，经典理性选择理论把「风险偏好」简单地定义为「金钱效用曲线的任何非线性特征」。

有关风险承担行为的研究表明，风险承担受个体差异的影响并不如受情境的影响强烈。最常见的描述是：当期望值高于目标（收益），个体倾向于规避风险；当期望值低于目标（损失），个体倾向于寻求风险（Kahneman and Tversky 1979）。学者有时用「不求最好但求满意」解释这一现象（March and Shapira 1992）。

假设风险偏好既不是个体特质又不直接取决于情境，而是学习的产品。已经有人证明，通过简单地复制成功而学习就会导致在收益面前规避风险、在损失面前寻求风险（March 1999c，第 15 章；Denrell 2007）。收益分布变异大的选项，其潜力可能因为样本小而被低估，进而被放弃。另一方面，损失分布变异小的选项，可能因为初步尝试几次总是得到负面结果而失去抽样机会，也就是被放弃。

这种现象的一个特例涉及小概率极端事件。小概率事件的出现次数分布是严重倾斜的。例如，重大科学突破。这样的事件，结果极其正面，但是发生机会非常之小。大多数研究者一辈子都不会经历这样的事件。实际上（或者，可能实际上），大多数学习者会低估极其稀有、极其正面事件的发生可能性，进而无意识地规避风险，不能像本来可能的那样复制与重大科学发现相连的行动（例如，高度敬业、积极投入）。

还有一些案例，涉及的是极少发生但后果十分严重的事件，比如核电厂的核事故。核事故的发生可能性极低，核电厂的大多数操作员不会经历。实际上（或者，可能实际上），大多数学习者会低估极其稀有、极其负面事件发生的可能性，进而无意识地寻求风险，复制增加核事故发生可能性的行为（例如，粗心大意）。在诸如此类的案例中，收益面前规避风险、损失面前寻求风险，不过是学习的产品。

看看这两类案例的不同之处，在涉及稀有正面事件的案例中，因为没有经历过事件，所以个体会放松复制加大事件发生可能性之行动（例如，勤奋努力）的力度，进而不仅减少矫正对事件发生可能性无意识低估的机会，而且真正让事件变得不大可能。学习会降低做出重大科学突破的机会。在涉及稀有负面事件的案例中，因为没有经历过事件，所以个体会放松回避加大事件发生可能性之行动（例如，马虎大意）的力度，进而不仅增加矫正对事件发生可能性无意识低估的机会，而且真正让事件变得更加可能。学习会增加酿成重大核事故的可能性，还会既通过更多地经历核事故又通过让核事故变得更加可能来「矫正」对风险的低估。

在这个问题上，贝弗莉·萨奥尔（Beverly Sauer）回顾有害环境管制经验后观察到，「机构制定书面标准，因为经验是蹩脚的老师」（2003，37）。萨奥尔解释说，长期置身于危险之中但一直安然无恙，人们就会淡忘曾经让自己非常忧心的危险，因此，经验具有双面性，一方面让人们泰然处之，另一方面让人们麻痹大意。

#### 2.4.2 配偶选择

Mate Choosing

Consider a world in which a person experiences and records each performance of a candidate for selection as a mate. To simplify, assume the candidates, on their part, make no choices but are simply available to be chosen. Each candidate’s performance is a draw from a normal distribution of possible performances. A candidate is chosen each time period by evaluating past experience with all candidates, recording the average performance of each candidate previously chosen, and anticipating that candidates who have not been chosen previously will, on average, have a performance equal to the mean of those who have.

What will be the key properties of such a world of mate seekers who learn from experience by replicating successes? Three properties of interest may be worth noting:

(1) The likelihood that a mate chosen in this way will be the best possible mate is small.

(2) The process will yield monogamy; that is, the choices made in one time period will tend increasingly to be repeated in the next. That tendency to monogamy will be moderated by postdecision disappointment but accentuated by competency gains from experience in the relationship.

(3) Participants in the process will understand themselves as having learned from experience successfully and will have confidence in their choices.

Thus we are led, perhaps, to what might be called the behaviorist manifesto. Risk aversion is not necessarily to be seen as a thoughtful choice, a mysterious trait, or a consequence of context; it can be pictured as a propensity produced by simple learning from ordinary experience. Monogamy is not necessarily produced by cultural norms or morality or by calculated rationality; it can be seen as a consequence of simple learning from ordinary experience.

It is not necessary to embrace entirely such skepticism about the more elaborate stories and theories articulated by scholars. The more elaborate stories may, in fact, be true even though particular aspects of the behavior can be approximated by a simple replication hypothesis. In both cases, however, the more complex interpretations by human actors and by economists, philosophers, psychologists, sociologists, and theologians can be seen as possibly reflecting elements of human conceit about the role of human intention and intellect in human behavior. They can be seen as stories told to honor and reinforce that conceit, a purpose possibly as noble as reflecting truth but different from it.

假设有这么一个世界，人们选择配偶，每次选择一个候选者，记录其表现。为了简便起见，假定选择是单向的，也就是候选者没有选择机会，只是等着被选。每个候选者的表现都来自潜在表现的正态分布。每一次首先计算曾被选过的候选者各自的平均表现，然后计算所有曾被选过的候选者的平均表现的平均值，把这个平均值当作所有未被选过的候选者的期望值，之后比较所有候选者，从中选择一个。

在这样的世界，如果人们通过复制成功而学习如何选择配偶，那么人们的配偶选择行为会表现出什么特点？三个有趣的特点值得一提：1）通过这种方式选择的配偶是潜在最佳配偶的可能性非常小。2）最后会出现一夫一妻制，也就是，下次重复上次所做选择的可能性会逐渐增加。以上趋势会因选择之后的失望而减弱，会因相处能力的提高而增强。3）在这一过程中，人们会认为自己从经验中学到了东西，对自己所做的选择越来越有把握。

这样，我们就要说到也许可以称为「行为主义者宣言」的东西。风险规避不一定要看成慎重选择、神秘特质或者情境产物，而是可以看成简单地从日常经验中学习而形成的一种倾向。一夫一妻制不一定是文化习俗、道德规范或理性计算的产物，而是可以看成简单地从日常经验中学习而得到的产物。

既如此，是否要质疑学者给出的比较复杂的故事和理论呢？并不是。实际上，比较复杂的故事也许是对的，即使行为的某些方面可以用复制成功解释清楚。然而，人类行动者以及经济学家、哲学家、心理学家、社会学家和神学家给出的比较复杂的诠释，可以看成也许反映了人类的自负，也就是高估人类意愿和智慧在人类行为中的作用。那些比较复杂的诠释，可以看成为了彰显并强化那种自负而讲的故事。彰显并强化那种自负，这一目的与追求真理不同，但是也许与追求真理一样高尚。

## 0301. 通过故事和模型来学习

LEARNING THROUGH STORIES AND MODELS

Organizations pursue intelligence through the low-intellect adaptive processes discussed in chapter 2. They also use high-intellect processes, which are the focus of this chapter. Low-intellect processes operate by replicating actions associated with experienced success. High-intellect processes operate by devising explicit understandings that fit the events of experience into a causal explanation through a natural language narrative, an analytical model, or a theory. Highintellect stories and models are bases both for refined understanding and appreciation of history and for differentiating among humans with respect to their knowledge.

Narratives of experience fill many studies of organizations, biographies and autobiographies of managers, journalist reports of organizational events, and the daily recitations of participants making sense of the events of organizational history. These narratives explore the events of episodes of history in order to discern the causal antecedents of experience. Similarly, models of experience fill many studies of organizations and the teachings of universities and consultants. Decision theory, economic theory, organization theory, game theory, and the stories told within those frames are centerpieces of organizational intelligence.

For some decades after the Second World War, stories and models generated by high-intellect processes for improving intelligence enjoyed a period of exceptional approbation. Although the fervor of the approval subsequently suffered from several conspicuous failures — most notably the defeat of the「best and the brightest」of the United States in Vietnam, the collapse of a monument to rational planning, the Soviet Union, and the orgies of disappointments with complicated strategies, hedge funds, and derivatives in financial markets — these stories and models of organizational life became almost taken for granted. They sustained a large collection of academics, writers, consultants, and practitioners.

High-intellect stories and models reflect the joint effects of two pressures. On the one hand, there is pressure that a story or model honor intelligence with subtlety and complexity that make it interesting. On the other hand, there is pressure that a story or model be simple enough to be comprehensible. The joint effect is a tendency for stories and models to be elaborate enough to celebrate human intellect but no more elaborate than their audience can tolerate. They tend to exhibit what might be called maximum comprehensible complexity.

Maximum comprehensible complexity is itself a function of the intelligence of audiences and the technology of stories and models, so it varies from one audience to another, from one instrument of storytelling to another, and over time. However, it is relatively insensitive to the underlying complexity of the process being described. Insofar as stories and models reflect maximum comprehensible complexity, they tend to be systematically more complex than simple processes and simpler than complex processes. The former tendency was explored briefly in chapter 2; the latter tendency is examined in this chapter.

组织通过低智适应追求智慧，也通过高智适应追求智慧。第 2 章讨论的是低智适应，本章将主要讨论高智适应。低智适应，就是简单地复制与成功相连的行动，而高智适应，要求厘清事物的因果关系，并用叙事（自然语言）、模型（符号语言）或者理论阐述出来。高智故事和模型，既是精确理解历史的基础，又是判断学问高低的依据。

组织研究、组织纪实报告、管理者的传记或自传、组织参与者的每日功课中，满是有关经验的叙事。这些叙事探索历史片段中的事件，试图理清事件之间的因果关系。类似的，组织研究、大学教材、顾问讲座中，满是有关经验的模型。决策理论、经济理论、组织理论、博弈理论，以及在那些框架之内讲述的故事，是组织智慧的核心。

第二次世界大战之后的几十年间，高智学习产生的故事和模型，广受追捧。尽管之后一连栽了几个大跟头 —— 其中最著名的是，美国的「出类拔萃之辈」在越战中失策，计划经济之典范的苏联解体，复杂战略、避险基金、金融衍生物让人大失所望 —— 但是这些有关组织生活的故事和模型的正确性，在人们心中几乎是不言而喻的，它们养活了一大群学者、作者、顾问和实践者。

高智故事和模型是两种压力联合作用的产物。一方面，故事和模型必须精妙复杂到显得有趣并彰显人类智慧；另一方面，故事和模型必须简单到足以让人理解。在这两种压力的联合作用下，故事和模型往往会变得比较详尽，详尽到足以赞美人类智慧，又不会变得太过详尽，免得不能让人理解。故事和模型倾向于展现 —— 也许可以叫作 ——「最大可理解复杂性」。

最大可理解复杂性本身是听众智慧以及故事讲述技术和模型建造技术的函数，所以随听众的不同而变化，随故事讲述技术和模型建造技术的不同而变化，还随时间而变化。然而，最大可理解复杂性往往对所述过程本身的复杂性相对不敏感。系统而言，只要故事和模型展现出最大可理解复杂性，就倾向于比简单过程复杂、比复杂过程简单。第 2 章简要探讨了前面那一趋势，本章将考察后面这一趋势。

### 3.1 故事和模型

STORIES AND MODELS

From the great Norse skalds (Sturluson 1984) to modern journalists (Halberstam 1972), humans have been inveterate storytellers. Roland Barthes (1977) describes narratives as universal, and Barbara Czarniawska (1997, 28) observes that interview respondents want to tell stories rather than answer questions. Managers, journalists, and scholars create and share stories and models of experience as bases for describing, explaining, and improving the events of organizational life and for establishing reputations for personal acumen. The objectives, techniques, and problems of such efforts are common among scholars, journalists, management consultants, and organizational participants. They are all storytellers and model builders (Weick 1995).

Stories and models are responses to an urge that permeates organizational life and organizations research. It is the urge to describe the causal basis of experience. Experience consists in a stream of events produced by processes that are complex, stochastic, and only partly observable. Causality is ambiguous. Generating an explanation of history involves transforming the ambiguities and complexities of experience into a form that is elaborate enough to elicit interest, simple enough to be understood, and credible enough to be accepted. The art of storytelling involves a delicate balancing of those three criteria.

Some features of human cognitive abilities and styles affect the ways stories and models are created from ambiguous and complex experience. Humans have limited capabilities to store and recall history. They are sensitive to reconstructed memories that serve current beliefs and desires. They have limited capabilities for analysis, a limitation that makes them sensitive to the framing that is given to experience. They conserve belief by being less critical of evidence that seems to confirm prior beliefs than of evidence that seems to disconfirm them. They distort both observations and beliefs in order to make them consistent. They prefer simple causalities, ideas that place causes and effects close to one another and that match big effects with big causes. They prefer heuristics that involve limited information and simple calculations to more complex analyses. This general picture of human interpretations of experience is well documented and well known (Camerer, Loewenstein, and Rabin 2004; Kosnik 2008).

These elements of individual human storytelling are embedded in the interconnected, coevolutionary feature of social interpretation. An individual learns from many others who are simultaneously learning from him or her and from each other. The stories and theories that one individual embraces are not independent of the stories and theories held by others. Since learning responds as a result to echoes of echoes, ordinary life almost certainly provides greater consistency of observations and interpretations of them than is justified by the underlying reality. In particular, ordinary life generally seems to lead to greater confirmation of prior understandings than is probably warranted.

Explanation fits experienced events into accepted frames. In economics, explanation involves demonstrating that observed events are consistent with the accepted axioms of rationality. In physics, explanation involves demonstrating that observed events are consistent with accepted physical laws. In fundamentalist religions, explanation involves demonstrating that observed events are consistent with accepted scripture. The key effort is to link experience with a preexistent accepted story line so as to achieve a subjective sense of understanding.

There are contending frames, of course, and the process of fitting experience into them involves negotiation over their comparative interest, comprehensibility, and credibility. The terms of such negotiation, particularly the relation between credibility and empirical validation, are the topics of treatises on scientific method and debates among scholars. Contestation over validity exhibits differences among scholars, but it typically depends on some level of shared recognition of a basic frame. Where such agreement is lacking, discussions of the interest, comprehensibility, and credibility of explanations can be acrimonious and incoherent. Experience interpreted within a Marxist frame is mostly unintelligible to a neoclassical economist. Experience interpreted within a Freudian frame is mostly unintelligible to a behavioral psychologist. And experience interpreted within a Foucauldian frame is mostly unintelligible to an organizational population ecologist.

The most obvious difference among storytellers of organizational experience is between those who see knowledge as expressed in natural language organized into narrative simplifications (roughly the literary/humanistic tradition) and those who see knowledge as expressed in abstract concepts organized into symbolic simplifications (roughly the mathematical/scientific tradition) (Snow 1959). Within the natural language contingent, the emphasis is on themes and grammars, and life is seen as represented by a narrative with conventions of texts. Within the symbolic language contingent, the emphasis is on the choice of mathematical frame, assumptions, and derivations, and life is seen as represented by a model with conventions of mathematical logic and formal rules of proof and inference.

Organizational storytellers, model builders, and theorists seek to make their interpretations both realistic and comprehensible, but the two objectives are inconsistent (Lévi-Strauss 1966, 261; Augier and March 2008, 96–98). Experience is rooted in a complicated causal system that can be described adequately only by a description that is too complex for the human mind. The more accurately reality is reflected, the less comprehensible the story, and the more comprehensible the story, the less realistic it is. The richness of life is made comprehensible only by creating portrayals of life that are, of necessity, incomplete. As Nietzsche (1997, 279) wrote:「Partial knowledge is more often victorious than full knowledge: it conceives things as simpler than they are and therefore makes its opinion easier to grasp and more persuasive.」

Stories and models simplify complex causal relations, reducing the number of variables involved, often ignoring second-and third-order effects, minimizing feedback effects, and glossing over variations in time delays. They often result in overfitting, explanations that provide post hoc interpretations of random variation that offer little subsequent predictive power. They simplify identities and the occasions for their evocation, reducing the nuance of identity fulfillment and the chaos of human obligations. They generally assume that causal stories are decomposable into simple subtexts that do not involve detailed interaction with each other. These simplifications necessarily reflect incomplete representations, but they facilitate comprehension. The models and stories of experience have to be in a form that can be communicated and understood.

The practitioners of natural language intelligence work endlessly through cycles of resolution and doubt, glorying in dilemmas, contradictions, and inconsistencies. Building on and venerating the indeterminacy of natural language, they interpret and reinterpret, less in a pursuit of closure than in a spirit of renewal (Ricoeur 1965; White 1987; Polkinghorne 1988; Czarniawska 1997; Gabriel 2004). The practitioners of analytical models similarly cycle between doubt and resolution but with a stronger conception of the possibility of progress toward the latter. They honor the openness and flexibilities of mathematics and statistics with their manifestations in imaginative extensions and systematic derivations. They see themselves as driven by a pursuit of extralinguistic truth (Kuhn 1962; Lave and March 1975; Williamson 1975; Scott 1981), but they find themselves persistently prone to statistical overfitting (Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman 2001).

In a manner quite similar to that of novelists and playwrights, managers, journalists, lawyers, and students of organizations eliminate and add facts to make a better (more compelling? more accurate?) story (Collingwood 1993). In the process, storytellers or model builders may reject some widely believed「facts」(e.g., miracles) as well as inject「facts」that are not observed but assumed (e.g.,「constitutive imagination,」「stylized facts」).

They also fit experience into a recognizable story line. Barbara Czarniawska wrote,「Stories do not emerge out of thin air; a great deal of collective work of the kind that Weick (1995) called sensemaking goes into their construction. . . . When a new event occurs, . . . it is made meaningful by setting it in an existing frame, even if it may mean that the frame must be somewhat adjusted and changed」(2008, 33, 38). Events are assembled into culturally familiar story types about them. For example, lawyers and courts create stylized stories and interpretations and seek both to learn from them and to provide their frames as bases for interpretations of testimony (Bennett and Feldman 1981).

Stories and models are never the product of one person alone. The storytellers have to deal not only with competing storytellers but also with the prejudices and expectations of listeners. They have to deal with participants who consciously seek to control interpretations by investing in authorized personal historians, called public relations experts or spin doctors. Storytellers have their individual sources and biases, but they have to gain acceptance of their stories by catering to their audiences. The primary way the themes underlying stories and models secure acceptance is through a social process of telling, retelling, reshaping, and evaluation by which interpretive ideas develop and diffuse through a population of storytellers and listeners involved in a common culture with a common language.

The idea that simplifications of experience within familiar frames are bases of human understanding and behavior is shared, though in somewhat different forms, by literary theorists (e.g., Ricoeur 1965), legal theorists (Dworkin 1986), phenomenologists (e.g., Schütz 1967; Berger and Luckmann 1967), symbolic interactionists (e.g., Blumer 1969; Van Maanen 1988, 1995), and ethnomethodologists (e.g., Garfinkel 1967; Cicourel 1974). The same processes of familiarization are evident in the development of formal models — for example, when the models of economics assume the easily comprehended form of models of physics (Mirowski 1989), or when complex systems of multiple variables are modeled as variations on linear regression (Greene 2008).

Thus, stories and models of experience are fictions seeking social confirmation as truth. They are fictions because truth is inaccessible. However, they represent a particular variety of fiction. They are fictions that explicitly invite confrontation with the evidence of observation, even while recognizing both the complexity of causality and the opaqueness of its observation. This tension between the aspirations for valid comprehensibility and the complexities and ambiguities of history permeates efforts to construct and confirm stories and models of experience. It also underlies challenges to the assumption that the simplifying heuristics of human cognition reflect regrettable irrationalities (Hogarth and Karelaia 2005; Gigerenzer and Brighton 2009).

Storytelling and model building also fuel the fundamental circularity of learning from experience. Humans are urged to learn from the experiences of history, but the experiences of history are encapsulated in frames invented by humans. Humans learn from their own inventions. The circularity does not preclude a meaningful augmentation of intelligence through exposure to experience, but it increases the possibilities for confusion and resistance to discrepant information in the process (Kuhn 1962).

从古代吟唱诗人（Sturluson 1984）到现代新闻记者（Halberstam 1972），人类就一直沉迷于讲故事。罗兰·巴特（Roland Barthes 1977）认为叙事是普遍的，芭芭拉·查米阿乌斯卡（Barbara Czamiawska 1977）观察到访谈对象宁愿讲故事而不愿回答问题。管理者、记者和学者创作并分享经验故事和模型，用于描述、解释并改进组织生活，并且用于营造聪明睿智的名声。学者、记者、管理顾问和组织参与者都是故事讲述者和模型建造者（Weick 1995），怀着同样的目的、使用同样的技巧、出现同样的问题。

故事和模型响应了组织生活和组织研究当中普遍存在的一个迫切要求，这一迫切要求就是，描述经验的因果基础。经验由复杂的、随机的、部分可观察的过程产生的事件流构成。因果关系是模糊的。诠释历史，涉及把经验的模糊性和复杂性转化成一种详尽到足以让人感兴趣、简单到足以让人理解、可信到足以让人接受的形式。讲故事的技巧，涉及在三个标准之间微妙地平衡。

人类如何用模糊而复杂的经验建造故事和模型，受人类认知能力和认知风格的某些特征的影响。人类存储、回忆历史的能力有限，对服务于当前信念和欲望的重构记忆敏感。人类的分析能力有限，对加诸经验之上的框架敏感。人类固守成见，对支持先入之见的证据不如对反对先入之见的证据挑剔。人类既歪曲观察又歪曲信念，以提高两者的一致度。人类偏爱简单的因果关系，认为原因必定在结果附近、大果必定有大因。与比较复杂的分析相比，人类更喜欢涉及有限信息和简单计算的启发式。人类诠释经验的这幅大图景，证据充分、众所周知（Camerer，Loewenstein，and Rabin 2004；Kosnik 2008）。

人类故事讲述之所以表现出这些特点，根本上是因为社会诠释具有互相连接、共同演化的特征。一个人在向很多其他人学习的同时，其他人也在向这个人学习，而且其他人之间也在相互学习。一个人持有的故事和模型并不独立于其他人持有的故事和模型。结果，学习对回声的回声做出响应。既然如此，那么日常生活的观察与诠释一致度几乎肯定高于真实值。特别是，一般而言，日常生活似乎过分证实先入之见。

解释把经验事件纳入公认框架。在经济学中，解释涉及证明观察事件符合公认理性定理。在物理学中，解释涉及证明观察事件符合公认物理规律。在基要派宗教中，解释涉及证明观察事件符合公认教义。关键是把经验与预先存在的公认故事情节连接起来，以获得主观理解感。

当然，有些框架是相互竞争的。把经验纳入相互竞争的框架，要求就这些框架的相对有趣度、可理解度和可信度进行协商。这种协商的条款，特别是可信度与实证效应的关系，是科学方法论的研究主题，也是学者的辩论主题。不同的学者，对效度有不同的主张。但是，效度主张一般取决于不同学者对基本框架的认识达成某种水平的一致。如果缺乏这种共识，那么学者在讨论解释的有趣度、可理解度和可信度之时，就可能异常激烈但各说各话。在马克思主义框架之内诠释的经验，在新古典经济学家看来，大都是莫名其妙的；在弗洛伊德框架之内诠释的经验，在行为心理学家看来，大都是莫名其妙的；在福科框架之内诠释的经验，在组织群生态学家看来大都是莫名其妙的。

组织故事讲述者之间最显而易见的差异，是那些主张用自然语言编造叙事、简化经验、表述知识的人（粗略归为文学 / 人文派）与那些主张用符号语言建造模型、简化经验、表述知识的人（粗略归为数学 / 科学派）之间的差异（Snow 1959）。自然语言派强调主题和语法，主张用带有文法规则的叙事表征生活。符号语言派强调数学框架、假定和推导，主张用带有数学逻辑规则和推断证明规则的模型表征生活。

组织故事讲述者、组织模型建造者和组织理论家力求让诠释既贴近现实又容易理解，但是这两个目标是相互冲突的（Levi-Strauss 1966，261；Augier and March 2008，96—98）。因果基础复杂的经验，要是面面俱到地描绘出来，就会太过复杂，人类根本理解不了。越准确地反映现实，故事就越不好理解；故事越好理解，就越不贴近现实。只有提纲挈领地描绘生活，才能让人理解生活的丰富。正如尼采（1997，279）写过的那样：「片面描述往往胜过全面描述：它简化现实，让观点更好理解、更具说服力。」

故事和模型简化复杂的因果关系，减少所涉变量数目，经常忽略二三阶效应、最小化反馈效应、掩饰时滞变异。故事和模型经常导致过度拟合的解释，这些解释对随机变异进行事后诠释，对未来没有什么预测力。故事和模型简化身份及其激活场合，抛开身份实现的细枝末节，降低人类义务的混乱程度。故事和模型一般假定，因果结构可以分解成若干个关系不大的子结构。这些简化必然是不完全表征，但是有助于理解。经验故事和模型必须采用一种可以交流、可以理解的形式。

自然语言智慧实践者的工作，在坚定和怀疑之间无限循环，因两难、矛盾和不一致而繁荣。他们依靠并敬重自然语言的不确定性，诠释再诠释，不求定论但求新解（Ricoeur 1965；White 1987；Polkinghome 1988；Czarniawska 1997；Cabriel 2004）。分析模型实践者，其工作也在怀疑和坚定之间循环，但是强烈地希望怀疑是暂时的、坚定是最终的。他们用想象延伸和系统推导向数学和统计的开放性和灵活性致敬。他们认为自己的动力是追求超语言真理（Kuhn 1962；Lave and March 1975；Williamson 1975；Scott 1981），但是发现自己总是容易犯统计过度拟合的错误（Hatie，Tib-shirani，and Friedman 2001）。

像小说家和剧作家一样，管理者、新闻记者、律师和组织学者经常为了创作更好的故事而删减或添加事实（Collingwood 1993）。在这一过程中，故事讲述者或模型建造者也许删掉某些极不可能出现的「事实」（例如，奇迹），添上某些没有观察到但应该有的「事实」［例如，「构成性想象」（constitutive imagination），「典型性事实」（stylized facts）］。

他们还把经验纳入容易识别的故事情节。芭芭拉·查米阿乌斯卡写道：「故事不是凭空出现的；故事建构过程，融合了大量卡尔·威克（Karl Weick）（1995）所说的释义（sensemaking）工作…… 当新事件发生，为了让新事件有意义，就把新事件放入现成框架中，即使这样做也许意味着必须对框架进行某种调整和修改（2008，33，38）。」他们把事件放入熟悉的故事情节中。例如，律师和法庭创作具有典型性的故事和诠释，力求既从中学习，又依据其框架诠释证词（Bennett and Feldman 1981）。

故事和模型绝不单单是哪个人的产品。故事讲述者不仅要应对与之竞争的故事讲述者，而且要应对听众的偏见和期望。有些组织参与者企图通过在授权组织历史学家 —— 或者叫作公共关系专家或媒体顾问 —— 身上投资来控制诠释，这类人也是故事讲述者要应对的。故事讲述者有着自己的材料来源和偏见偏好，但是要想让故事被人接受，就要迎合听众的口味。故事和模型的深层主题，主要通过以下社会过程让人接受：在有着共同文化和共同语言的故事讲述者与听众群中讲述、再讲述、改造和评价，形成并传播诠释性观点。

在熟悉框架内简化经验，是人类理解世界的基础，文学理论家（例如，Ricoeur 1965）、法学理论家（例如，Dworkin 1986）、现象学家（例如，Schutz 1967；Berger and Luckmann 1967）、符号交互学家（例如，Blumer 1969；Van Maanen 1988，1995）和民俗方法学家（例如，Garfinkel 1967；Cicoure 1974）都这样做，只是形式稍有不同。这种熟悉化，在正式模型的建造过程中也很明显，例如，经济学模型借鉴物理学模型中容易理解的假定（Mirowski 1989），多变量复杂系统的建模用的是线性回归的变式（Greene 2008）。

因此，经验故事和模型是希望被社会证实为真相的虚构。它们是虚构，因为真相是不可接近的。然而，它们代表一类特殊的虚构。它们是明确希望与观察证据对质的虚构，即使既认识到因果关系的复杂性，又认识到观察的不透明性。一方面，故事和模型希望让人理解；另一方面，历史是复杂的、模糊的，两者的冲突渗透在建构并验证经验故事和模型的全过程中。「启发式反映了令人遗憾的非理性」的假定之所以受到挑战，也是因为这一冲突（Hogarth and Karelaia 2005；Gigerenzer and Brighton 2009）。

从经验中学习具有循环性（circularity），这一根本特征也是故事讲述和模型建构造成的。人类渴望从历史经验中学习，但是历史经验封装在人类发明的框架之中。人类从自己的发明中学习。循环性并不排除从经验中学习可以增长智慧，但是会增加混淆的可能性，而且会加强对与已有信念不一致的信息的抵触（Kuhn 1962）。

### 3.2 组织故事

THE STORIES OF ORGANIZATIONS

The world of organizations and management invites storytelling (Zaleznick 1989; Westerlund and Sjøstrand 1979; Gabriel 2004). Knowledge is sought about experience, but experience is ambiguous and its causal structure complex. Identities are ambiguous, and the ways in which they apply to particular situations are intricately multifaceted. The development and elaboration of stories and models of experience are a major part of the documentation of management. Participants are asked what happened and why it happened, and research often consists primarily in tabulating the stories told by storytellers (Sarbin 1986; White 1987; Collingwood 1993; Bruner 1996; Golden-Biddle and Locke 1997).

Stories of organizational experience are found in business cases taught in business schools and in administrative cases taught in public management programs. They are found in business plans discussed by venture capitalists and in discussions of administrative reform in government. They fill popular management books and the media. They are embedded in economic and organizational theories of choice. The storytellers of organizations are, for the most part, associated with the stock analyst, business press, political pundit, and academic trades. The ability to tell interesting, comprehensible, and credible stories is a mark of intelligence among observers of organizations.

The stories of organizations, like stories of many other parts of modern life, are told both in the guise of formal models and in the guise of narratives. Much of contemporary organizational economics assumes the form of a few simple equations (Gibbons and Roberts 2008) that can be used to provide economic interpretations of organizational regularities (Kreps 1990a). The ideas are abstractions representing elementary characteristics of organizational life that are used to interpret properties drawn from the elaborate details of that life. Much of the rest of contemporary literature reporting research on business firms or governmental agencies assumes a narrative form in which organizational experience is interpreted in terms of stories that extract a few themes from, or impose them on, the rich detail of organizational experience (Czarniawska 1997; Hernes 2008).

Often the stories are contested. Consider attempts to describe the rise of Microsoft and its human symbol, Bill Gates. In version 1 of the Microsoft story, Gates is pictured as a brilliant innovator and tactician with extraordinary insight and managerial ability. It is a variation on earlier stories of Andrew Carnegie and Henry Ford. In version 2 of the Microsoft story, Gates is pictured as a lucky bully who never had an original idea in his life but has been ruthless in stealing and promoting the ideas of others. It is a variation on the robber baron stories of the nineteenth century. One reason for the contestation is, of course, that the future of Microsoft and its competitors is itself contested. In the same way in which Americans are considerably more likely than non-Americans to attribute the rise to power of the United States to admirable properties of the nation and its citizens, positive stories of Microsoft are more characteristic of people who live in Seattle than of those who live in San José or Salt Lake City.

Some of the problems involved in high-intellect processes for experiential learning can be illustrated by efforts to convert the experiences of corporate history into an understanding of organizational profitability. Business firms sometimes do well, sometimes do poorly. Managers and researchers seek to use observed experience as a means for identifying attributes that differentiate high-performing (profitable) from low-performing (unprofitable) organizations. They try to tell acceptable stories about the reasons for the pattern that is observed, a pattern that typically arises from a complex combination of actions taken by many individuals and organizations, as well as the vagaries of fate.

Although claims of knowledge about the determinants of organizational performance are a standard feature not only of popular do-it-yourself books but also of the research literature, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that (within the standards of inference that are accepted as conventional in science) most studies of organizational performance are unable to untangle the causal structure affecting performance with any confidence. The difficulties stem, in large part, from (a) the extent to which organizations have assimilated past understandings and thereby considerably reduced variability in policies, practices, and forms; (b) the mismatch between the complexities of the causal system and the simplicity of the ideas used to describe it; (c) the dependence of profit on factors that are unobservable or simultaneously codetermined by profit; (d) the large number of uncontrolled factors; and (e) the small sample size of experience. These difficulties in identifying the causal structure of organizational performance are neither secret nor recently discovered (Staw 1975; Lenz 1981; March and Sutton 1997). They are regularly noted in critical reviews and are taught in elementary courses in quantitative and qualitative inference.

Despite the complications in extracting reality from experience, or perhaps because of them, there is a tendency for the themes of stories of management to converge over time. Ideas about the determinants of profitability come to be shared as part of the story of「good practice.」The interpretations of Bill Gates are likely to achieve some kind of shared understanding, as have the interpretations of Henry Ford and Genghis Khan. The shared understandings will not be based exclusively on accumulated evidence, although it will certainly accumulate. Rather, they will develop as conventions of discourse, as part of what it means to be an educated person and as part of establishing standing in ordinary conversations.

组织与管理世界欢迎故事讲述的行为（Zaleznick 1989；Westerlund and Sjostrand 1979；Gabriel 2004）。人类在经验中寻找知识，但是经验是模糊的，经验的因果结构是复杂的。身份是模糊的，身份应用于具体情境的方式是纷繁的。发展并丰富经验故事和理论，是管理学研究的重大任务。研究者经常问被试发生了什么、为什么发生，研究的主要内容经常就是把被试讲述的故事制成表格（Sarbin 1986；White 1987；Col-lingwood 1993；Bruner 1996；Golden-Biddle and Locke 1997）。

在商学院讲授的商业案例中，在公共管理课程讲授的行政管理案例中，可以看到有关组织经验的故事。在风险资本家讨论的商业计划中，在政府机构讨论的行政改革中，可以看到有关组织经验的故事。在经管书籍中，在大众媒体中，满是有关组织经验的故事。组织故事讲述者大部分都与证券分析师、商业媒体、政治评论家和学术团体有联系。对组织观察家而言，能够讲述有趣的、好理解的、可信的故事，是智慧的标志。

组织故事，就像现代生活很多其他方面的故事一样，既有可能披着正式模型的外衣，也有可能披着自然叙事的外衣。当代组织经济学，大都采用几个简单的等式（Gibbons and Roberts 2008），为组织规律提供经济学诠释（Kreps 1990a）。其习惯是，从组织生活细节中提取几个基本特征，定义成抽象概念，确定概念之间的关系，用模型的形式阐述出来。其余有关商业公司或政府机构的当代研究文献，大都采用叙事形式，从组织经验的丰富细节中提取几个主题，或强加几个主题，用故事的形式阐述出来（Czamiawska 1997；Hemes 2008）。

不同人根据同一经验讲述的故事，往往是相互冲突的。就拿描述微软及其象征人物比尔·盖茨（Bill Gates）的崛起来说吧。微软故事版本 1，把比尔·盖茨刻画成有着非凡洞察力和管理能力的杰出改革家和战略家。这个故事与早期有关安德鲁·卡耐基（Andrew Carnegie）和亨利·福特（Henry Ford）的故事大同小异。微软故事版本 2，把比尔·盖茨刻画成一生之中从未有原创想法只是无耻地窃取并推广他人想法的幸运恶霸。这个故事与 19 世纪有关强盗大亨的故事大同小异。当然，两个版本的故事之所以相互冲突，一个原因是微软及其对手的未来会如何这件事本身就是有争议的。就像美国人比非美国人更有可能把美国权势扩张归因于美国及其国民令人羡慕的特征一样，住在西雅图的人比住在圣何塞或盐湖城的人更有可能讲述正面的微软故事。

高智体验式学习的有些问题可以解释为，学习者力图把组织历史经验转化成对组织盈利的理解。商业公司有时经营得好，有时经营得差。管理者和研究者力图根据观察经验找出能让高绩效（赚钱的）组织与低绩效（不赚钱的）组织区分开来的属性。他们试图讲述可以让人接受的故事，诠释为什么出现所观察到的模式。所观察到的模式，一般产自很多个人和很多组织的行动的复杂结合以及命运女神的奇思妙想。

尽管标准的管理畅销书和标准的组织研究文献都声称了解决定组织绩效的各种因素，但是我们几乎不可能不得出结论说（在约定俗成的推断规则之下）：大多数有关组织绩效的研究不能有任何把握地理清绩效产生的因果结构。其中的困难大部分来自于：a）组织多大程度上吸收了过去的理解，进而大大减少了政策、实务和形式的变数；b）因果结构的复杂与用来描述因果结构之观点的简单不相匹配；c）影响利润的因素，有些是不可观察的，或者同时受到利润的影响；d）大量不可控因素；e）经验样本小。理清组织绩效因果结构过程中的这些困难，既不是秘密，也不是最近才发现的（Staw 1975；Lenz 1981；March and Sutton 1997）。文献评论经常提到这些困难，量化与质化研究基础课程也经常提到这些困难。

尽管（或者因为）从经验中提取现实存在很多问题，但是（或者所以）管理故事的主题倾向于随着时间而趋同。不同的故事倾向于对决定盈利的因素达成共识，这一共识最后变成「最佳实践」的一部分。对比尔·盖茨的诠释倾向于达成某种共识，就像对亨利·福特和成吉思汗的诠释一样。尽管证据肯定会累计，但是共识的达成并非完全基于累计证据。相反，共识会作为论述规则而发展，会作为受过教育的人的衡量标准之一而发展，会作为日常谈话中确定立场的依据之一而发展。

### 3.3 神话主题

MYTHIC THEMES

Standard journals and books dealing with both the private and public sectors tell stories of organizational history that emphasize a few conventional themes. Included in those themes are some easily recognized ideas about experience. Outcomes are produced by people, and thus stories of people and events are intertwined. The world is one in which there is competition for primacy, and only the fittest survive. Problems have solutions, and those solutions can be found by intelligence. The world changes, and ability to adapt is necessary for survival. These stories and story themes are obviously vital to the ways in which people in organizations comprehend their histories. They form the bases of interpreting experience and the frames within which experience can be shared.

In particular, stories of organizational experience are deeply affected by themes that are accurately described as myths:「Any real or fictional story, recurring theme, or character type that appeals to the consciousness of a people by embodying its cultural ideals or by giving expression to deep, commonly felt emotions」( The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 1981).

Myths are instruments for reducing the confusions of experience, human comprehension, and human enactment. Stories or models with mythic standard story lines provide comprehensible meaning and credibility (Vygotsky [1962] 1986; White 1987). Mythic story lines are not straitjackets. They combine sacredness (and stability) with some openness to variation. Constructing stories from mythic themes involves many different stories and substories (mythemes in Lévi-Strauss’s terms) that provide plenty of material for bricolage by storytellers (Lévi-Strauss 1966, 1979). The options are, however, limited by the necessity to construct a story that will be deemed credible, and credibility thrives on familiarity.

Organizational stories and models are built particularly around four main mythic themes (March 1999b). The first mythic theme is the myth of rationality: the idea that the human spirit finds definitive expression through taking and justifying action in terms of its future consequences for prior values. Action is understood as reflecting choice, and choice is seen as made in terms of consequences.

Rationality is seen as both a dictum of good behavior and a prediction of behavior. It is pervasive in the stories and models of both public and private management. It underlies the extensive discussions of「incentives」as critical to organizational behavior. It is the basis of answers to the question「why did you/he/she/they/I/we do that?」The answer is given in terms of expectations of consequences and incentives: the action was taken because it made consequential sense. In the conventions of economics as those conventions have become folk wisdom, behavior is explained when a rational consequential reason can be given for it.

The second mythic theme is the myth of hierarchy: the idea that problems and actions can be decomposed into nested sets of subproblems and subactions such that interactions among them can be organized within a hierarchy. Hierarchical decomposition is the basis for the hierarchical organization of problem solving and organization. It involves a combination of decentralized (in parallel) work and integration, with integration being hierarchical. Responsibility for accomplishing a complex task can be arranged in a system of subordination and domination in which each higher level controls and integrates the solutions and actions at a lower level. Ideas about hierarchically organized control and accountability permeate organizational stories. They are reflected in organization charts and business plans. They are the basis for efforts to allocate personal responsibility for success and failure and for a host of standard prescriptions for effective organizational structures.

The myth of hierarchy suppresses the possible importance of other kinds of network structures. For example, the symmetry of the story of game theory with its coalitions among parallel actors is transformed in discussions of organizations into a story of hierarchically dominant「principals」who achieve their objectives through clever management of incentives offered to subordinate「agents」(Milgrom and Roberts 1992). The intricacy of informal networks and their importance are subordinated to the formal hierarchy of an organization.

The third mythic theme is the myth of individual leader significance: the idea that any story of history must be related to a human project in order to be meaningful and that organizational history is produced by the intentions of specific human leaders. In typical organizational stories or models, individual actions are presumed to be the basic building blocks for understanding organizational experience. Events of history are seen as due to human intentions and as produced by the interaction of identifiable individual projects of competition and cooperation (Polkinghorne 1988). Major developments in organizational history are imagined to be attributable to exceptional human action and capabilities, that is, to the actions of leaders.

Managerial/organizational history is as filled with heroes as is military history, from which it takes many of its metaphors (Kieser 1997). A fascination with the rise and fall of companies is translated into stories of the rise and fall of leaders. Just as stories of the rise and fall of armies become stories of the competence and incompetence of generals, stories of the growth and decline of business firms become stories of the vision and lack of it of CEOs. The identity, character, and obligations of leadership are common foci for managerial education.

The fourth mythic theme is the myth of historical efficiency: the idea that history follows a path leading to a unique equilibrium defined by antecedent conditions and produced by competition. The theme is an essential basis for the emphasis on market competition as a selective mechanism among business organizations. The basic ideas are that history favors those individuals, organizations, forms, practices, and beliefs that match the requirements of their environments; that efficiency is assured through competition; and that survival is evidence of superior fit to environmental requirements. Historical efficiency is an elementary idea borrowed from classical functionalism as supplemented by Malthus ([1798] 2001) and Darwin ([1859] 2006). Competitive outcomes are seen as necessary in an environment; victories result from superiorities; defeats result from deficiencies.

Historical efficiency appears in stories of the triumph of good organizational practices (e.g., quality circles, new public management, lean production, business process reengineering, total quality management, organizational culture, knowledge management) over inferior practices. It appears in the inclination to treat the results of market or political competition as natural and necessary. Patently, there is a certain inconsistency between the myth of individual leader significance and the myth of historical efficiency, but the combination of familiar but inconsistent themes is a common feature of human storytelling.

The four myths are by no means an exhaustive listing of the themes available to organizational storytellers. There are many others of varying consistency with them and of varying acceptability. In particular, each of the main themes has a countertheme that is well enough known to qualify as a possible element in a story. The countertheme to the myth of rationality is the theme of identity. Rather than following a logic of consequences, individuals match situations to the demands of an identity. The countertheme to the myth of hierarchy is the theme of nonhierarchical networks. Individuals are joined in complicated networks of associations. The countertheme to the myth of individual leader significance is the theme of complexity. History is made by the actions of complex combinations of many individuals. The countertheme to the myth of historical efficiency is the theme of historical inefficiency. The processes of adaptation are slow and have multiple equilibria.

Stories built on the main myths undoubtedly will more easily find credence than will stories built on the counterthemes, but part of the process of mythic development is found in the experiments with themes by storytellers. They provide opportunities to elaborate the main myths to accommodate new refinements and to test the possibilities for fundamental reorientation of the mythic basis of stories. At the same time, the way in which counterthemes are positioned as denials of the primary themes tends to highlight the central intellectual position of the latter.

Underlying many of these myths is a grand myth of human significance: the idea that humans can, through their individual and collective intelligent actions, influence the course of history to their advantage. Such a myth is both a matter of faith and a basis for interpretations of experience. It is widely accepted as obvious, though it is clearly more widely believed in successful organizations and cultures than in those where success is less familiar. It is not self-evident — or perhaps only that.

The myth of human significance produces the cruelties and generosities stemming from the human inclination to assign credit and blame for events to human intention. Responsibility for social and economic well-being is allocated to political parties and politicians. Responsibility for profits and losses and for changes in stock value is allocated to managers of firms. Responsibility for public satisfaction or dissatisfaction with social programs is allocated to political leaders or to managers of governmental agencies, creating「adequately blameworthy」agents (Shklar 1990, 62). In the course of such allocation of responsibility, any possible distinction between personal moral responsibility as a confirmation of human significance and behavioral responsibility as an assertion of causality tends to be lost. As Robert Reich (1985, 23–28) observes,「There is an overwhelming tendency in American life to lionize or pillory the people who stand at the helms of our large institutions — to offer praise or level blame for outcomes over which they may have little control.」These certifications of human control over destiny are precious to human ideology (Czarniawska 1997, 38–39). On a more mundane level, the myth of accountability that they sustain affects managerial behavior in observable ways (Tetlock 1992).

不管是有关私人领域还是有关公共领域的标准期刊和数据，所讲述的组织故事都强调几个通俗的主题。那些主题，有些可以轻易看出是有关经验的。事是人做的，因此有关人的故事和有关事的故事是互相交织的。活在世上，就要为生存而竞争，只有最适应环境的才能生存下去。问题都有答案，运用智慧可以找到那些答案。世界在变化，要想生存下去，适应能力必不可少。显而易见，这些故事和故事主题对组织中的人如何理解组织历史至关重要。它们形成了经验诠释的基础和经验分享的框架。

特别是，有关组织经验的故事受到一类独特主题的深刻影响。这类主题，准确来说，应该称作神话：「任何通过具体化一个民族的文化理想或者表达一个民族共同深深体验到的情绪情感来取悦这个民族的或真实或虚构的故事、重复出现的主题或者性格类型」［《美国英语传统辞典 1981》（The American Heritage Dic-tionary ofthe English Language 1981）］。

神话是减轻历史经验、人类理解和人类展演三者之混淆的工具。带有标准神话情节的故事或模型会提供容易理解的意义，还会提供可信性（Vygotsky［1962］1986；White 1987）。神话情节不是约束衣，它们既具神圣性（稳定性），又允许一定程度的变动。围绕神话主题建构故事，就需要很多不同的故事和子故事［用列维 - 斯特劳斯（Levi-Strauss）的术语说，就是「神话素」（mytheme）］，好为故事讲述者提供原材料（Levi-Strauss 1966，1979）。然而，因为故事讲述者建构出来的故事必须被人视作可信的，而可信度与熟悉度密切相关，所以故事讲述者的选择是有限的。

组织故事和模型，专门围绕四大神话主题而建构（March 1999b）。第一个神话主题是理性（rationality）神话：人类遵循结果逻辑采取行动、为行动辩护，人类精神由此得到明确表达。行动是做选择，做选择要遵循结果逻辑。

理性既被视作好行为的标志，又被视作未来行为的预测因子。理性神话遍布公共领域的管理故事和模型，也遍布私人领域的管理故事和模型。很多人认为「激励（incentive）」是组织行为的关键所在，这一观点的基础就是理性神话。人们经常会问或被问到：「你 / 他 / 她 / 他们 / 我 / 我们为什么那样做？」回答这一问题要依据理性：之所以采取某个行动是因为这个行动具有结果主义意义，也就是基于对结果和诱因的期待采取某个行动。在那些成了民间智慧的经济学规则中，如果给出了结果主义理性原因，就解释了行为。

第二个神话主题就是层级（hierarchy）神话：问题可以分解成一层一层的子问题，行动可以分解成一层一层的子行动。组织采用层级结构并用层级方式解决问题，依赖的基础就是层级神话。采用层级方式解决问题，就是把任务逐层分解下去，各部门平行开工，然后把成果逐层整合上去。有关组织逐级实施控制、追究责任的观点，渗透在组织故事之中，反映在组织结构图和商业计划之中。组织把任务分配到人头、功劳归结到人头、责任追究到人头，依据的基础就是层级神话。很多人创建组织，首先想到的就是采用层级结构，这也是层级神话在作祟。

因为层级神话的存在，所以其他可能很重要的网络结构变得不重要了。例如，有关博弈理论的故事具有对称性，也就是结成联盟的各方行动者，之间的关系是平行的、对等的，这种对称性放在组织故事中，就变成了层级性，也就是上级行动者通过激励下级「代理人」来实现目标（Milgrom and Roberts 1992）。在组织中，非正式网络的错综性和重要性次于正式层级。

第三个主题是领导者个人举足轻重（individualleader significance）神话：任何历史故事要想有意义，都必须和伟人扯上关系；组织历史是组织领导者根据个人意愿创造的。在典型的组织故事或模型中，个人行动被视作组织历史的基本构件。历史是人创造的，是重大人物相互斗争、相互合作的结果（Polkinghome 1988）。组织历史的重大发展应该归因于非凡的人类行动和能力，也就是领导者个人的行动和能力。

管理 / 组织历史像军事历史一样，满是英雄；管理 / 组织历史的很多暗喻，都从军事历史中借鉴而来（Kieser 1997）。对公司沉浮的迷恋，转化成了对领导者个人沉浮的迷恋。就像有关军队沉浮的故事变成了有关将军有无能力的故事一样，有关商业公司兴衰的故事变成了有关 CEO 有无远见的故事。领导者的身份、性格、义务是管理教育的常见焦点。

第四个神话主题是历史有效（historical efficiency）神话：历史遵循的路线，通向唯一的均衡，这个唯一均衡由先前条件和竞争共同决定。很多人强调市场竞争是商业公司的自然选择机制，他们之所以这样强调，就是因为相信历史有效。历史有效的基本观点是：历史青睐那些符合环境要求的个人、组织、形式、实务和信念；竞争会确保历史的有效性；能够生存下来，就说明与环境要求的匹配度较高。历史有效神话，融合了古典功能主义的基本观点，后来又融合了马尔萨斯（Malthus）（［1798］2001）和达尔文（Darwin）（［1859］2006）的一些观点。竞争是必需的，优者胜，劣者汰。

历史有效神话，表现在有关优秀实务（例如，品质圈、新公共管理、精益生产、业务流程再造、全面质量管理、组织文化、知识管理）战胜不良实务的故事之中，表现在人们把市场竞争或政治竞争看成自然的、必要的这一倾向之中。领导者个人举足轻重神话与历史有效神话显然存在一定程度的不一致，但是人类故事讲述的一个常见特点就是，结合相互冲突的熟悉主题。

这四个神话主题绝对没有穷尽组织故事讲述者可以用到的所有神话主题，还有其他很多神话主题可用。其他神话主题，人们的接受程度各不相同，与以上四大神话主题的一致程度也各不相同。特别是以上四大神话主题，每个都有一个反主题，反主题本身也很有名，足以成为故事的要素。理性神话的反主题是身份主题：个体不是遵循结果逻辑，而是把情境与身份要求匹配起来。层级神话的反主题是非层级网络主题：复杂的联系网络把组织中的个人连接起来。领导者个人举足轻重神话的反主题是复杂性主题：历史是由多个个人的行动的复杂结合创造的。历史有效神话的反主题是历史无效主题：适应是缓慢的，具有多重均衡。

围绕四大主题而建构的故事当然比围绕各自反主题而建构的故事更容易找到支持证据，但是故事讲述者在尝试神话主题的过程中会或多或少地对它进行调整，或者精练它、丰富它、壮大它，或者考虑是否要弱化它，甚至颠覆它。与此同时，把四个反主题放在四大主题的对立面，倾向于突出四大主题在智慧王国里的中心地位。

这些神话，很多下面潜藏着一个更大的神话：人类举足轻重，也就是，人类可以通过个体的或集体的智慧行动影响历史进程，让历史按照对自己有利的方向发展。这样的神话，既是一种信仰，又是经验诠释的基础。很多人相信「显而易见，人定胜天」，只是不太成功的组织中相信这一点的人略比比较成功的组织中相信这一点的人少。「人定胜天」并非不证自明的 —— 或者也许仅仅是不证自明的。

因为相信「人类举足轻重」，所以人们倾向于把历史事件归功于或者归咎于人类意愿，进而慷慨地或残忍地对待领导者。国民幸福的功劳、国民不幸的责任被归到政党和政治家的身上，股价上涨的功劳、股价下跌的责任被归到公司管理者的身上，社会项目取悦公众的功劳、社会项目惹怒公众的责任被归到政治领导者或政府机构管理者的身上，只有领导者才配受崇拜、受谴责（Shklar 1990，62）。这样归功论责，即使存在理清因果关系的机会，也会被「人类举足轻重」的信念抹杀。正如罗伯特·赖希（Robert Reich）（1985，23—28）观察到的那样，「美国人有一种势不可挡的倾向：把大型机构的掌舵人送到领奖台上或钉在耻辱柱上 —— 因为丝毫不为他们左右的事情而表扬或谴责他们。」这种做法，是对人类掌控命运的肯定；对人类意识形态而言，这种肯定弥足珍贵（Czarniawska 1997，38—39）。在更世俗的水平上，基于这种肯定的问责神话以可以观察到的方式影响着管理行为（Tetlock 1992）。

### 3.4 真理、正义与美

TRUTH, JUSTICE, AND BEAUTY

Stories and models of experience comprise a large fraction of the effort to learn from experience by educated observers of organization. They find their primary traditional value in their claim to being accurate representations of an extralinguistic truth, but they also find value in their contributions to justice — creating social order — and beauty — the aesthetic pleasure they provide.

建构经验故事和模型，是受过教育的组织观察者从经验中学习的一块主要工作。经验故事和模型，不仅因为声称准确表征超语言真理而具有真理价值（真理价值是主要的传统价值），而且因为创建社会秩序而具有正义价值、因为提供审美乐趣而具有美学价值。

#### 3.4.1 真理价值

Truth Value

Within conventional interpretations, intelligent action demands accurate comprehension of the world, and an accurate comprehension of the world demands an accurate interpretation of experience. Insofar as the themes on which the stories of experience are built either correctly portray the world or create the world, the stories will provide useful guides for action. Words such as「reality,」「accurate interpretation,」and「correct portrayal」are anathema to purists of social construction, but for most people they have patent relevance to a discussion of learning.

Although it is widely believed that organizations or scholars can, in principle, develop stories and models that correctly represent the underlying reality of organizational life (Argyris and Schön 1978; Nonaka and Takeuchi 1995), the procedures by which stories and models are created, in themselves, offer few guarantees of validity. This is not primarily because human learners are incompetent. The reality they are asked to reflect is difficult to discern in ordinary experience, even with the best tools of observation and inference. The world is too complex and experience is too meager. For example, business school students are trained to take events of simulated experience in business cases and interpret them according to the frames they have been provided, primarily from economics but on other occasions from organization studies, accounting, operations research, marketing, or other domains. The exercise may well be useful, but it would be hard to claim that the interpretive stories they tell are unambiguously implicit in the events.

Similarly, stories interpreting observed experience are among the earlier and more respected contributions to research in organization studies. Examples include studies by Abegglen (1958) of the Japanese factory, Gouldner (1954) of industrial bureaucracy, Roethlisberger and Dickson (1939) and Walker and Guest (1952) of worker groups, Whyte (1955) of street corner organization, Selznick (1949) of cooptation, and Kaufman (1960) of the forest ranger. These studies, as well as many others like them, have been very important sources of ideas for students of organizations, although it is hard to view the ideas presented as unambiguously implicit in the events described in the studies. Indeed, some of the more artful practitioners of the craft resist making their own explicit interpretations, leaving meanings to be elaborated by others (Chekhov 1979; Krieger 1979).

Stories from experience are often profoundly believed and widely shared, but neither the depth of beliefs nor the generality of agreement about them speaks decisively to their validity. Moreover, the comprehension of experience is often contested. Widely shared beliefs are widely challenged. Contemporaries argue about what happened and why it happened. Beliefs about the lessons of experience are often localized by political or linguistic boundaries. Colonial history is told differently in different places. Individuals write memoirs and autobiographies, seeking to affect interpretations of the events of history, but they do not agree among themselves. As is often observed, history is written by the winners. In particular, history as recorded is a story told to (and by) victorious leaders. As a result, it is usually a story of the actions and intentions of leaders and mirrors the properties of skaldic histories of glorious heroes.

Although conventionalized understandings often endure for extended periods, any portrayal of historical interpretation as stable over time is inconsistent with the history of history. Beliefs about historical experience change gradually, partly in response to new information and partly in response to new interpretive ideas. As the prejudices of dominant groups change, the stories of history reflect changing political correctness: Puritan rigidities change from symbols of steadfastness to symbols of bigotry. Native Americans change from savages to environmental pioneers.

In his famous parable about the emperor’s new clothes, Hans Christian Andersen (1837) reminds his readers of the extent to which the social conception of reality may deviate from palpable truth. The story of the emperor’s clothes, however, is potentially misleading. The storyteller reveals explicitly that the emperor is, in fact, naked. He invites his readers to see the ludicrous way in which social validation of a palpable falsehood is sustained until challenged by an innocent, not fully socialized boy. Thus, the readers of the story know the truth and see the errors of social consensus and conformity.

In the more typical case in real life, the truth is obscure. What is known is that almost everyone agrees that something is true, even though it may not seem to be true to a particular individual. This latter situation is considerably more problematic than the former. Confronted with consensus beliefs that the world is round, what are we to make of our own experience that seems to indicate it is flat? Confronted with consensus beliefs that smoking tobacco has adverse long-run effects, what are we to make of our own experience that smoking seems to make us feel better?

Much as the plots of acceptable romantic comedies can be specified by a student of films, the frames of most stories could probably be written without any knowledge of the specific events to be described. Indeed, part of the argument for stories and models is that the enduring frames on which they are based are closer to the truth than any particular set of contemporary observations. Is it possible that the story frames and models that we accept present truer pictures of reality than our direct experience? Giambattista Vico ([1725] 1961; Bitney 1969) argued that myths capture the essential elements of history, removing the irrelevant noise of actual events. In a similar way, it has been argued that a meta-analysis of numerous incomplete and erroneous stories of the rise of Nokia can be made to yield a valid story (Lamberg, Laukia, and Ojala 2008). And Kathryn March reported that the stories told by Tamang women about the experiences of their lives「are epics because what they tell is larger than any one telling, larger even than the sum of all possible tellings. They reach beyond themselves, full of connections apparently outside of, but in the end an integral part of, the stories」(2002, 12).

Likewise, a student of economics is assured that although immediate direct experience may sometimes seem to disconfirm the teachings of economic models, the problem is more likely to lie with the observations or their interpretations than with the theory.

The claims are powerfully instructive, and they evoke childhood memories of treating the poor results of classroom physics experiments as evidence of incompetent experimental techniques rather than erroneous theories. However, the claims are difficult either to validate empirically or to derive from widely believed assumptions. The argument suggests a kind of「central limit theorem」in which the random noise that confuses the interpretation of immediate experience is reduced by the pooling of experience reflected in the accepted frames of stylized stories. The number and credibility of assumptions required to justify the derivation are, however, daunting.

On the surface, at least, it appears that, outside closely constrained domains involving repeated experience, ordinary experience (observation) will not yield much in the way of unambiguously valid lessons if we apply the standards of evidence that are shared widely among scholars. Anton Chekhov in a letter to his publisher, A. S. Suvorin, on May 30, 1888, wrote,

It is time for writers, and particularly for artists, to admit that you can’t figure out anything in this world, as Socrates once admitted and as Voltaire kept admitting. The public thinks it knows and understands everything; and the dumber it is the broader its horizons seem to be. However, if an artist whom the public believes decides to state that he understands nothing of what he sees, that in itself is of great significance in the realm of thought and is a great step forward. (Chekhov 1979, 270)

A similar kind of humility has been suggested for statistical model builders. The more general the model (i.e., the more alternative patterns of relationships and functional forms it allows), the greater the likelihood that the model will, in effect,「fit」the noise in the system, resulting in a good fit but poor predictability. This bias-variance dilemma (Geman, Bienenstock and Doursat 1992; Gigerenzer and Brighton 2009) forces a choice between the overfitting errors of complex models and the oversimplicity of simple ones.

Humility on the part of high-intellect learners and skepticism about the lessons they propose seem clearly warranted, but is there some alternative? Is it possible to justify as anything other than a personal or social prejudice our intuitive acceptance of some stories and rejection of others as containing germs of truth? By what criteria do we (or ought we to) judge one story as more credible than another? The plays of writers such as William Shakespeare, Henrik Ibsen, or Anton Chekhov are often portrayed as revealing important truths about the human condition and human behavior (O’Connor 2008). Indeed, they are sometimes used to instruct managers or those who aspire to be managers (Gagliardi and Czarniawska 2006). For example, Ibsen’s plays have been used to develop the idea that powerful ideals suborn lies and to argue that such a mechanism operates in contemporary organizations (March 2008, chap. 20). The poetry of William Yeats has been used to explicate the managerial dilemma of speaking a rhetoric of decisiveness, certainty, and clarity while experiencing a life of doubt, paradox, and contradiction (March 2008, chap. 19). The theorems of game theory and the metaphors of garbage cans have been used to interpret the strategic behavior of business firms (Gibbons 1992; 2003). What does it mean to say that such observations resonate with our understandings and thereby deserve credence? How do we judge whether they are true?

Novelists, playwrights, artists, and social scientists all claim veracity in their stories and models, a link to widely shared understandings of the nature of experience. Some would say that what distinguishes the two groups is a difference in the willingness to see their specific stories or models as part of an explicitly collective endeavor to discover truth (Kuhn 1962) and thus, in principle, as disconfirmable through evidence. The difference is important, but it does not change a fundamental similarity. The stories of novelists and social scientists are judged, in part, on whether they are credible, and it seems unlikely that the assessment of credibility is enormously different in the two cases.

How do we assess the credibility of stories told by Chekhov? Is it different from the way we assess the credibility of stories told by Weick? Is credibility distinct from artistry? From technique? What are data of experience and how do they enter the calibration of credibility? Can credibility be separated from interest and ideology? Or from familiarity? The point is not to pretend to settle such issues. They seem to endure comfortably in the face of innumerable efforts to resolve them. The point is to observe that there is by no means general agreement that the stories and models of organization studies are more (or less) credible than the stories of novelists or playwrights.

In order to develop a technology for assessing credibility of stories and models, it will probably be necessary to recognize explicitly the tenuous link between experience and reality. When Carlos Fuentes (e.g., in Aura), Gabriel García Márquez (e.g., in 100 Years of Solitude), or Isabel Allende (e.g., in Stories of Eva Luna) writes of worlds in which reality and fantasy are difficult to distinguish, each speaks not only for novelists but also for social scientists. The best of both breeds seeks to exhibit veracity and do so by methods in which imagination is often given an importance comparable to observation in capturing an elusive reality.

The possibility of extracting more information about an underlying reality from small, rich samples motivates modern work on「hypothetical histories.」Such histories require the use of observed experience and imagination to generate distributions of possible experiences. In the process, possibilities derived from speculation are promoted to approximately the same status as observed reality (Tetlock 1999). It is a tempting direction, but it is difficult to provide persuasive demonstration of its validity or definitive elaboration of a standardized methodology to accomplish it.

在通俗的诠释中，智慧行动要求准确理解世界，而准确理解世界要求准确诠释经验。只要经验故事的主题正确刻画或者创造了世界，故事就会对行动提供有用的指导。诸如「深层现实」「准确诠释」「正确描绘」之类的词语，是社会建构学家的常用语，但是，对大多数人而言，这些词语只会用在有关学习的讨论中。

尽管很多人相信，组织或者学校原则上可以发展出正确表征组织生活深层现实的故事和模型（Argyris ans Shon 1978；Nonaka and Takeuchi 1995），但是故事和模型建造流程本身不能为效度提供什么保证。这并非主要因为人类学习者的无能，而是主要因为故事和模型所要反映的深层现实很难从日常经验中挖掘出来，即使有最好的观察工具和推断工具。世界太复杂，而经验太贫乏。例如，商学院用商业案例教学生，让学生从模拟经验中学习，并让学生用现成框架诠释模拟经验中的事件，这些现成框架主要来自经济学，但有的也来自组织研究、会计财务、运筹研究、市场营销或者其他领域。这种练习很可能有用，但是很难说学生讲述的诠释性故事确实蕴含在那些事件之中。

类似的，早期对组织研究做出贡献的颇受尊敬的学者，也用故事诠释观察经验。例如，阿贝格伦（Abegglen 1956）研究日本工厂之时，古尔德纳（Gouldner 1954）研究工业领域官僚主义之时，罗斯里斯伯格（Roethlisberger）和迪克逊（Dickson 1939）以及沃克（Walker）和格斯特（Guest）研究工人小组之时，怀特（Whyte 1955）研究街头组织之时，塞兹尼克（Selznick 1949）研究合作之时，卡夫曼（Kaufman 1960）研究护林员之时，他们做的这些研究，以及其他很多诸如此类的研究，一直是组织学者非常重要的思想源泉，尽管很难看出组织学者提出的思想确实蕴含在这些研究描述的事件之中。确实，有些比较擅长此道的学者，拒绝明确地诠释自己的思想，而是留待别人挖掘其中的意义（Chekhov 1979；Krieger 1979）。

人们往往深深相信、广泛分享来自经验的故事，但是相信的深度、分享的广度都不能肯定地保证故事的效度。此外，人们对经验的理解往往是相互冲突的，广泛分享的信念也受到广泛的挑战。同一时代的人总是就发生了什么、为什么发生争论不休。有关经验启示的信念往往受到政治和语言边界的限制。殖民历史，在殖民国家的讲述中与在被殖民国家的讲述中是不一样的。人们写回忆录或自传，力求影响对历史事件的诠释，但是不同人写的回忆录或自传对同一历史事件有不同的描述。正如经常观察到的那样，历史是胜者书写的。特别是，记载中的历史是对（或者由）获胜的领导者讲述的。结果，历史往往是有关领导者行动和意愿的故事，而且往往是对伟大英雄的歌功颂德。

尽管通俗的理解往往会持续一段时间，但是「历史诠释不随时间而变化」的说法并不符合历史的历史。有关历史经验的信念会渐渐变化，部分是对新的信息做出响应，部分是对新的诠释性观点做出响应。随着统治阶级偏见的变化，历史故事反映着不断变化的政治正确性：清教徒的恪守传统从坚定不移的象征变成顽固不化的象征；土著美国人从野蛮人变成拓荒者。

在著名寓言《皇帝的新衣》中，汉斯·克里斯蒂安·安徒生（Hans Christian Andersen 1837）提醒读者，人们会睁着眼睛说瞎话到多么严重的地步。然而，《皇帝的新衣》这个故事具有潜在的误导性。故事讲述者明明白白指出了，实际上，皇帝什么也没穿。故事讲述者请读者看的是：社会大众有时会罔顾事实，滑稽地支持一个显而易见的谎言，直到一个没有完全社会化的、天真无邪的小孩说出大实话。因此，故事的读者知道真相为何，也看到了社会舆论的威力和盲目从众的危险。

在现实生活中，比较典型的情况是，真相是模糊的。人们口中所谓的真相，不过是大多数人的共同看法。这种情况的问题比上面提到的《皇帝的新衣》更为严重。在世人普遍认为世界是圆的时候，如果亲身经验告诉我们世界好像是平的，那么我们要怎么办？在世人普遍认为吸烟有害健康的时候，如果亲身经验告诉我们吸烟似乎让我们觉得好受了一些，那么我们要怎么办？

就像没看过某部浪漫喜剧的电影系学生可以具体说出其中的大部分情节一样，根本不了解某个事件具体细节的故事讲述者也能围绕该事件写出故事的大致框架。确实，有人认为，故事和模型之所以具有存在的价值，原因就是故事讲述和模型建造所依据的永恒框架，比当代任何观察都更接近真相。公认的故事或模型框架比我们的直接经验更准确地反映真相吗？这可能吗？加姆巴蒂斯达·维科（Giambattista Vico）（［1975］1961；Bitney 1969）认为，神话抓住了历史的要素，去掉了不相干的噪声。类似的，还有人认为，对很多不完整的、有错误的诺基亚崛起故事进行元分析，就可以产生一个有效的故事（Lamberg，Laukia，and Ojala 2008）。凯瑟琳·马奇（Kathryn March）报告说，塔芒族女子讲述的有关其人生经历的故事「是史诗，因为她们的讲述，比任何一个讲述都大，甚至比所有可能的讲述加起来都大，她们超越了自己，她们的故事充满引申含义，这些引申含义，表面上看在故事之外，实际上是故事不可分割的一部分」（2002，12）。

同样，经济学教授向经济学学生保证，尽管直接经验有时似乎并不符合教材中的经济学模型，但是问题更可能出在他们的观察或诠释上，而不是出在模型本身。

以上断言颇具教育性，也唤醒了我们儿时的记忆：物理实验课上得到的结果不好，说明我们的实验技术不合格，而不是理论有错误。然而，以上论断既难进行实证效验，也难从公认假定推导出来。以上断言隐含着某种「中央极限定理（central limit theorem）」：反映在典型故事之公认框架中的经验汇集，会减弱对直接经验的诠释造成干扰的随机噪声。然而，要推导出这一结论，需要很多很多的假定，还需要这些假定非常非常地可信。

至少，表面上看，除了在一些可以反复练习积累经验的狭小领域之外，根据广大学者公认的有效标准来判断，日常经验（观察）好似不会产生多少确实有效的启示。1888 年 5 月 30 日，安东·契诃夫（Anton Chekhov）在给出版商苏沃林（A.S.Suvorin）的一封信中写道：

作家，特别是艺术家，是时候承认，我们无法弄清这个世界上的任何事情，正如苏格拉底（Socrates）曾经承认以及伏尔泰（Voltaire）一直承认的那样。公众自以为知道并了解一切事情；越傻的人似乎越容易说自己无所不知。然而，如果一位深受公众信任的艺术家决定发表声明说他一点儿都不了解自己见到的事情，那么在思想王国，这种声明本身就具有重大意义，是一个巨大的进步（Chekhov 1979，270）。

有人曾建议，统计模型建造者要有类似的谦虚。实际上，模型越通用（即可以引申出的关系模式和函数形式越多），就越有可能「拟合」系统中的噪声，结果就是拟合度高但预测力差。面对偏差 - 方差困境（bias-variance dilemma）（Geman，Bienenstock and Doursat 1992；Gigerenzer and Brighton 2009），模型建造者必须选择是建造复杂模型犯过度拟合错误还是建造简单模型犯过度简化错误。

一方面，高智学习者要保持谦虚；另一方面，听众要对他们的故事和模型持怀疑态度，除了这两个看似显然合理的办法外，还有其他办法吗？我们凭直觉接受某些故事，认为它们反映了真相，我们凭直觉拒绝某些故事，认为它们曲解了真相，我们的这种做法，除了归结为个人偏见或社会偏见以外，还能归结为其他什么东西吗？我们（或者应该）根据什么标准判断这个故事比那个故事更可信？经常有人说，诸如威廉·莎士比亚、亨利·易卜生或安东·契诃夫之类的剧作家揭露了有关人类境况和人类行为的重要真相（O'Connor 2008）确实，这些剧作家有时被人用来教导管理者或者那些立志成为管理者的人（Gagliardi and Czarniawska 2006）。例如，有人曾借易卜生的剧作提出「强大的理想唆使人提供伪证」的观点，并且用它论证这样的机制在当代组织中起作用（March 2008，第 20 章）。有人曾用威廉·叶慈（William Yeats）的诗作论证管理辞令要求果断、确定和清晰，而现实生活充满怀疑、悖论和矛盾（March 2008，第 19 章）。有人曾用博弈理论和垃圾桶理论诠释商业公司的战略行为（Gib-bons 1992；2003）。这样的观察符合我们的理解因此值得相信，这么说意味着什么？我们如何判断它们是否是真的？

小说家、剧作家、艺术家和社会科学家都声称自己的故事或模型反映了真相，即符合大多数人对经验本质的理解。有些人会说，两群人的不同之处在于，是否愿意认为：除了自己以外，还有很多人也在努力发现真相，因此自己的故事或模型原则上是可以用证据证伪的（Kuhn 1962）。这个差异很重要，然而，尽管存在这一差异，但是两群人在根本上还是类似的。小说家的故事、社会科学家的故事，都要接受是否可信的评判，对小说家故事的可信度评价、对社会科学家故事的可信度评价，似乎不太可能有多大的不同。

我们如何评价契诃夫所讲故事的可信度？评价方式与评价威克所讲故事可信度的方式不同吗？可信性与艺术性截然不同吗？与讲述技巧呢？什么是经验数据，计算可信度时如何参考经验数据？可信度可以与兴趣和意识形态分离开来吗？与熟悉度呢？本书的目的不是假装解决这些问题。尽管人们付出了不懈的努力去解决这些问题，但是这些问题好像没有丝毫的解决迹象。本书的目的是指出，人们永远不可能达成共识说：组织研究所提故事和模型的可信度高于（或者低于）小说家，或剧作家所讲故事的可信度更高。

为了开发一项评价故事和模型可信度的技术，也许有必要明确地认识到经验与现实之间的薄弱联系。当《奥拉》的作者卡洛斯·富恩特斯（Carlos Fuentes）、《百年孤独》的作者加布列·加西亚·马尔克斯（Gabriel García Mírquez）、《伊娃·露娜的故事》的作者伊莎贝尔·阿连德（Isabel Allende）描写亦真亦幻的世界之时，每个人都既在为小说家说话又在为社会科学家说话。两群人中的佼佼者都力求准确地反映现实，而且在这样做的时候认为，对把握难以捉摸的现实而言，想象与观察同样重要。

从小而丰富的样本中也许可能挖掘出更多有关深层现实的东西，这一可能性激励着现代学者研究「假设历史（hypothetical history）」。这样的历史，要求运用观察经验和想象生成可能经验的分布。在这个过程中，从揣测中推导而出的可能现实被提到与观察现实几乎同等的地位（Tetlock 1999）。这个研究方向很有吸引力，但是我们很难令人信服地证明这种研究的效度，也很难为这种研究提出明确的、详尽的、标准化的方法论。

#### 3.4.2 正义

Justice

The truth value of stories and models seems difficult to establish, but the stories told about experience are not simply instruments of causal truth. The myths and themes that frame experience are entrenched in, and at the same time contribute to, the development of taken-for-granted social structures. Many organizational endeavors are more dependent on the sharing of understandings (reliability) than on their correctness (validity).

Shared understandings are the basis for conversations among human actors, conversations that lead the actors to imagine a common experience, permit them to coordinate their actions more easily, and help them to shape and enforce social norms of justice (Bartel and Garud 2009). In the language of classical organization theory, stories and models are devices by which uncertainty is absorbed (March and Simon 1958, 164–66). They allow action to take place within comprehensible stories rather than incomprehensible reality. Convergence on a story of group history is particularly important. In that spirit, Benedict Anderson (1991) argued that a sense of nationality involves understandings of an imagined community built on a constructed history through a judicious combination of amnesia, invention, and interpretation.

Such understandings are also significant factors in creating a viable social system of justice. Justice is a difficult aspiration to define and to achieve. It requires broad agreement within a society on elements of fairness and on individual and social responsibilities. The stories and models of high-intellect learning are part of the apparatus by which such agreement is obtained. They facilitate social convergence of belief and individual and social confidence in intelligence.

At the same time, storytelling provides a basis for social approval. Being able to tell a sharable and interesting story of experience is an important aspect of the intelligence both of participants and of scholars. The ability to tell a convincing, high-intellect story about experience marks a superior manager, a superior researcher, and a superior consultant. Developing such capabilities is a primary responsibility of organizations. In that spirit, John Stuart Mill wrote,「The first element of good government being the virtue and intelligence of the human beings composing the community, the most important point of excellence which any form of government can possess is to promote the virtue and intelligence of the people themselves」([1861] 1962, 32). Thus, life in organizations is marked by a quest for stories and models of maximum comprehensible complexity, an interpretation of life that is simultaneously suitably interesting and suitably comprehensible to signal intelligence, and for the development of individuals who can expound such interpretations.

故事和模型的真理价值似乎很难确定，但是经验故事并非仅仅揭示因果真相的工具。用来给经验加框的神话和主题，既依赖同时又促进被人视作理所当然的社会结构的发展。很多组织研究与其说是在努力正确反映现实（效度），不如说是在努力达成共识（信度）。

共识是人类行动者交流对话的基础。通过交流对话，行动者可以分享经验、形成共感；交流对话允许行动者更加容易地协调彼此的行动，有助于行动者形成并实施正义的社会规范（Bartel and Garud 2009）。在古典组织理论的语言中，故事和模型是用来吸收不确定性的工具（March and Simon 1958，164—166）。故事和模型允许行动者在可以理解的故事下行动，而非在不可理解的现实下行动。讲述群体历史的众多故事应该趋同，这一点尤其重要。本着那一精神，本尼迪克特·安德森（Benedict Anderson 1991）主张，民族感涉及对一个想象共同体的理解，这个想象共同体以建构历史为基础，建构历史的制造过程，明智地结合了健忘、发明和诠释。

对创建可行的正义的社会制度而言，这样的理解也很重要。正义是很难定义也很难实现的目标。它要求人们对公正的要素以及个人和社会的责任达成广泛的共识。高智学习产生的故事和模型，是获得这种共识的工具。它们促进信念的社会趋同，提高个人和社会对智慧的信心。

与此同时，故事讲述为社会认可提供基础。能够讲述可分享的、有趣的经验故事，是智慧的一个重要标志，对组织参与者而言如此，对学者而言亦如此。能够讲述令人信服的、高智的经验故事，是优秀管理者、优秀研究者和优秀顾问的标志。培养这种能力，是组织的一项主要责任。本着那种精神，约翰·斯图亚特·米尔（John Stuart Mill）写道：「任何一种形式的政府，能够具有的最大优点就是，发扬国民的美德和智慧；判断一个政府是好是坏，首先要看的就是它能否发扬国民的美德和智慧。」（［1861］1962，32）因此，组织生活的一个重要特征就是，寻找具有最大可理解复杂性的故事和模型，并且努力培养能够阐述这样的故事和模型的人。

#### 3.4.3 美

Beauty

The Anglican struggle over retaining the King James translation of the Bible in spite of its translation confusions, or the more general struggle within Jewish, Muslim, and Christian communities over challenges to the historical accuracy of biblical accounts, are reminders that beauty and veracity are not necessarily codeterminate. Keats’s proposition that「beauty is truth, truth beauty」is an enchanting idea but not readily demonstrable. In the prosaic domains of ordinary life, it seems obvious that many things that are true about human existence are far from beautiful, and many things that are beautiful are not true.

Beauty, truth, and justice are independent components of virtue, but beauty is not a lesser value than the others. The classic trinity of scholarly worth does not subordinate one value to any of the others (Lave and March 1975). Nowhere is that independent autonomy more important than in stories of organizations. Organizational life is given value by the ability to tell a story of beauty about it. Ideas are a form of art (March 2008, chap. 1).

It is a vision that resonates with the better examples of the organization storytelling craft. When John Padgett and his colleagues describe the origins of Florentine political and economic organization (Padgett and Ansell 1993; Padgett and McLean 2006), or Karl Weick (1996) describes the reaction of a firefighting crew to crisis, or Steven Barley (1986) describes the way in which CAT technicians make sense of their machines, or Charles Perrow (1984) describes the orchestration of accidents, the stories are beautiful. When Harrison White (1970) describes vacancy chains, or Albert Hirschman (1970) describes the trade-offs among exit, voice, and loyalty, or Thomas Schelling (1978) derives macro implications from micro motives, or William Feller (1968) describes stochastic processes, the models are beautiful. The beauty is neither incidental nor guaranteed. It is carefully crafted and not reliably exhibited in the stories and models produced by others.

Even a casual reading of the history of human civilizations suggests that the production and appreciation of objects that provide aesthetic pleasure are significant aspirations of intelligence. Nietzsche described the historian’s job as「inventing ingenious variations on a probably commonplace theme, in raising the popular melody to a universal symbol and showing what a world of depth, power and beauty exists in it」(1957, 37–38). It is not a bad job description for those who would capture the lessons of experience through stories and models.

英国国教徒一直在烦恼：金·詹姆斯（King James）翻译的《圣经》，语言很美，但有错误，要不要继续用下去。犹太教徒、伊斯兰教徒和基督教徒一直在争论：《圣经》里面的叙述，具有多少历史准确性。这些事情提醒着我们：美的不一定真，真的不一定美。济慈（Keats）说过「美就是真，真就是美」，这个观点很迷人，但并不好证明。有一点似乎显而易见，在日常生活中，很多真实反映人类存在的事情远远称不上美丽，很多美丽的事情并不真实。

美、真理和正义是相互独立的美德，但是美学价值并不比真理价值和正义价值小。对学术而言，美学价值、真理价值和正义价值是三位一体的，没有主次之分（Lave and March 1975）。没有什么比组织故事更强调独立自主的重要性。能够用美丽的故事讲述组织生活，就是赋予组织生活以价值。想法就是艺术品（March 2008，第 1 章）。

这一点在那些优秀的组织故事和模型中体现得淋漓尽致。当约翰·帕吉特（John Padgett）及其同事描述佛罗伦萨政治和经济组织的起源（Padgett and Ansell 1993；Padgett and McLean 2006），当威克（1996）描述消防队员对危机的反应，当史蒂文·巴利（Steven Barley 1986）描述 CAT 技术员如何理解机器，当查尔斯·佩罗（Charles Perrow 1984）描述引发事故的各种相互作用，故事是美的。当哈里森·怀特（Harrison White 1970）描述空缺链，当艾伯特·赫希曼（Albert Hirschman 1970）描述退出、呼吁与忠诚权衡，当托马斯·谢林（Thomas Schelling 1978）描述微观动机和宏观行为，当威廉·费勒（William Feller 1968）描述随机过程，模型是美的。美既不是偶然的也不是必然的。美是精心制造出来的，不能轻易地复制。

即使是随便浏览一下人类文明史也会发现，制造并欣赏提供审美乐趣的事物，是智慧的重要目标。尼采把历史学家的工作说成是「在老主题上翻新花样，把流行小调提升成普世象征，并且证明其中存在一个深奥的、强大的、美丽的世界」（1957，37-38）。对于那些想通过故事和模型从经验中挖掘启示的人来说，这个工作说明还不错。
