### 0101. 新知卡

新知卡，是有什么理论模型、推断证据、故事或行动，挑战了你的既有认知。新知卡的信息结构是：已知 + 新知 + 例子。「已知」建议挑选大众或自己以前的观念或掌握的知识；「新知」建议挑选自己更新之后的新知。「例子」建议使用自己日常生活中碰到过的事情，这样更容易记忆。新知卡举例如下：

{
已知：通过熟人找工作更容易。

新知：社会学家马克·格兰诺维特的弱联系理论告诉我们，在大多数人寻找工作的过程中，弱联系的那些人起到的作用最大。

例子：读本科时，我的第一份实习工作是一个统计论坛上素未谋面的朋友介绍的。
}

请通过文档提炼一张新知卡，新知的主题是：「认识到人类的认知可以是科学研究而不光是哲学思辩的对象还不到 150 年」。尽可能多的列举文档中的例子，并将例子具体展开。开始前请先重新阐述任务。

### 0201. 术语卡

术语卡记录的是阅读中出现过的陌生术语或概念，有时候是学术词汇，有时候是作者发明的黑话。如果不是作者首创的术语，建议找到最原始的论文或者资料，查询谁首先提出了这个术语，分辨哪些是作者真正意义上的原创贡献，哪些是作者改善前人研究，哪些是作者故意曲解他人术语。一旦养成这种习惯，你的独立思考能力就会增强。术语卡常见的信息结构是：「标题 + 定义 + 解释 + 例子」。试举如下：

{
标题：什么是执行意图？

定义：它是一种制订计划的方式。认知心理学家彼得·戈尔维策将「我要减肥十斤」这种制订计划的方式称为「目标意图」，将使用「如果...那么...」（if...then...）的句式来制订计划的方式称为「执行意图」。

解释：执行意图通过在大脑中提前规划执行计划的时间、地点，从而更易引发行动。

例子：你可以将「我要多运动」改写为「如果到了每天傍晚 5 点，那么我就去操场跑步」。前者是目标意图，后者是执行意图。
}

原文：

我很害怕感冒初期的症状，因为我知道，一场「惨剧」即将降临。接下来的几天，我的喉咙会肿起来，鼻子会变成流涕不止的水龙头，我的每一次咳嗽都伴着疼痛，总之我感觉糟糕、疲惫、头疼。更糟糕的是，我知道这些痛苦不是由入侵的病毒造成的，而是我的身体为了对抗病毒而自发产生的炎症反应造成的，这种认知让我对于感冒越发痛恨。从机理上说，发炎是指免疫系统在发现有害病原体、有毒物质和受损组织之后第一时间做出的反应。大多数情况下，炎症出现得迅速而强烈。无论破坏者是病毒、细菌还是过度日晒，免疫系统都会迅速调集大批细胞投入战斗。这些细胞会密集地释放大量化合物，造成血管扩张、渗透性提高，从而让白细胞顺利穿过血管进入受损组织，消灭入侵者。额外增加的血流量为身体提供了重要的免疫细胞和免疫液体，但是血管的膨胀会挤压神经并引发 4 种基本的发炎症状：皮肤发红、发热、肿胀和疼痛，从字面上看就是「着火」了。接下来，如果需要的话，更多的防御功能会被激活，免疫系统会针对特定的病原体产生抗体，然后将其消灭。

一直以来，凡是思维正常的人，都不会将舒舒服服坐在椅子上这件事，与我们体内被微生物或者损伤所点燃的身体免疫之火联系起来。躺在沙发上放松几小时，读一本书或者看看电视，怎么就与保护身体不受感染联系起来了？

近期一项新技术的出现，令这一问题迎刃而解。这项技术可以精确测量细胞泵入血液中的 1000 多种微小蛋白质中每一种蛋白质的含量。其中数十种被称为细胞因子（cytokines）的蛋白质负责调节炎症。科学家通过研究细胞因子启动炎症和终止炎症的机理，发现有一些细胞因子既可以在面对感染时激发出短暂、强烈和局部的炎症反应，也可以在全身范围内激发出持久、不易被感知的慢性轻度炎症。这种炎症以不易察觉的「文火慢炖」的方式在身体的多个部位经年累月地存在，而不像人体在对抗感冒时那种突然袭来的炎症，在某个部位上驻留几天或者几周然后消失。慢性轻度炎症就像是得了一场永远无法痊愈的感冒，但它们又极为轻微，你甚至根本感觉不到它们的存在。但是，炎症又的的确确存在于你的体内，因为有大量证据证明它们确实存在，就在你身体的某个部位缓慢地燃烧，悄悄地破坏着你的血管组织、肌肉组织、肝脏组织、大脑组织和其他器官。

慢性轻度炎症及其影响的发现既为治疗疾病创造了新的机会，同时也造成了新的烦恼。过去 10 年，越来越多的充分证据表明慢性轻度炎症是十几种与衰老相关的非感染性疾病的主要诱因，其中包括心脏病、2 型糖尿病和阿尔茨海默病。科学家对这一领域的研究越深入，就越会发现慢性轻度炎症在更多疾病中留下的痕迹，包括结肠癌、红斑狼疮、多发性硬化症，以及各种以「炎」命名的疾病，比如关节炎。慢性轻度炎症是值得人们特别关注的热门话题，但是我们也需要警惕，避免反应过度。最糟糕的言论是 —— 只要避免摄入谷蛋白和糖等「促炎症」食物，或者大量摄入姜黄根和大蒜等「抗炎症」食物，就能预防或者治愈从孤独症到帕金森病的几乎所有疾病。如果你觉得这些神奇的食谱完美得不可信，那你的感觉没有错。我们不能被这些江湖庸医带偏，不去关注我们真正需要关注的地方。坏消息是，慢性轻度炎症确实在很多严重的疾病中起作用。好消息是，慢性轻度炎症的一大诱因在很大程度上是可以避免、可以预防、可以解决的，这些诱因是吸烟、肥胖、某些促炎症食物的过度摄入，其中最主要的一种食物是红肉；另一大诱因你可能万万没想到，那就是缺乏活动。这一结论再次将我们带回「坐」这一主题 —— 坐在椅子上放松几小时，怎么会造成身体发炎呢？

#### 4.1 金句卡 —— xx


丹尼尔·利伯曼.(2022).锻炼.(谭杰译).天津科学技术出版社 => 译者序 —— 我可以热爱体育但是讨厌锻炼吗

原文：

「体育」一词来自日语，「锻炼」一词源于冶金行业，「体育课」的名称由「身体教育」简化而来。虽然在中文里都没有太悠久的历史，但三个词语的边界还算清晰。只是在使用中又排列组合出「体育锻炼」「体育健身」「锻炼身体」「竞技体育」等，显得有些纷乱。

我在这里略加梳理一下，当有人调侃「数学是体育老师教的」的时候，这里的体育指的是身体教育；当有人喊出「人生能有几回搏」的时候，他说的则是真正意义上的体育，人们通常也会称之为竞技体育。

当毛泽东主席于 1952 年写下「发展体育运动，增强人民体质」，以及更早之前写下「欲文明其精神，先自野蛮其体魄」的时候，所指的都是锻炼。不要以为主席不知道锻炼一词，就在这两次关于体育的论述之间，他还曾经在延安期间题词：「锻炼体魄，好打日本」。必须承认，主席对于锻炼的认识极其深刻，他甚至用了「体质」「体魄」等不同的词来描述锻炼行为所针对的对象。

总之，身体教育应该是一门终身教育的课程，它能够教会你掌握身体和健康方面的知识，对自己的身体和健康保持充分关注。

锻炼是人类最近几千年来，尤其是越来越多的工具出现之后，由于体力劳动的减少，而不得不进行的额外的身体活动，其唯一目的是保持身体的健康状态和正常机能。而体育是人类的伟大发明，是一种高级的游戏。在任何一个人类文化中，体育都在某一个阶段被发明了出来，它回馈给人类的，是崇高的仪式感和精神上的高度满足。

#### 5.1 图示卡 —— 学艺模型

2023-12-30

说明：

成为专家的道路上，不是一条单一的路径，而是一个多维度的过程。学艺模型与中世纪欧洲的工匠学艺行会系统相似，但已经适应了现代社会的变化。这个模型分为三个阶段：学徒、熟练工和大师，每个阶段都代表着技能和责任意识的增长。

在学徒阶段，个体从基础开始，通过观察和模仿来学习技艺，其工作和错误都由导师负责。这是技能积累、感官、空间以及人际交往能力的发展期。

进入熟练工阶段，个体开始独立工作，并在实践中磨练技能，逐渐发展出独特的个性和声音，学会从你到他们的转换（重点不在于你），这个阶段的关键在于对技能的精进和个性的形成。

最后，大师阶段意味着建立自己的工坊，教授学徒，传递知识和专长给下一代；对专业领域有着更广泛的责任意识；甚至会引领这个领域的新方向。

唯一编码：202401070106

原文：

本书的核心就是这个「学艺模型」（apprenticeship model）。几个世纪以来，这个理论在欧洲广泛流传，在世界各地也有类似的理论。许多人认为该模型与中世纪工匠学艺的行会系统有关。尽管英国的许多学徒制度正在被社会、政治与工业化变革所淘汰，但该模型依然有助于我们的思考。在历史上，「学艺」是指学习一门手艺或行当，但对我而言，这个词也适用于各种专家 —— 从动物标本剥制师到教师，从水管工到飞行员。即使大多数人没有仔细思考过这个模型，也能凭直觉理解。最重要的是，该模型形象地表明了进步的理念。我会以这个模型作为本书的框架。

从传统上讲，学艺过程包含了三个阶段 —— 学徒、熟练工与大师。当然，现在的社会条件与中世纪的欧洲截然不同。学徒不再睡在师父的家里，也不再需要无偿工作多年，但是这种阶段划分为想要成为专家的人提供了指引。

1、学徒：你在开始学习时一无所知。你观察、模仿别人，学着去做师父工坊里的那些事情。你的师父要为你的工作和你犯的错误负责，而你工作取得的任何成绩也属于师父。

2、熟练工：你以独立专家的身份开始职业生涯。你离开了师父的工坊，周游全国。现在你要为自己的工作负责，必须面对犯错的后果。你会不断获得经验，磨炼并精进你的技能，发展你的个性。

3、大师：最后你建立了自己的工坊，开始教授他人。你把自己的知识和专长传递给了下一代。你尽可能地照顾那些向你学习的人；你对自己的专业领域有着更广泛的责任意识；有时你甚至会引领这个领域的新方向。

这三个阶段是理解技能学习的有效方法，但它们是描述性的，而不是解释性的。这些阶段阐明了过程中的节点，但不会告诉你如何到达这些节点，或怎样才能知道自己何时到达。这些阶段将学艺过程分成了不同的部分，并将这些部分视为静态的。它们衡量了可以衡量的东西，但许多重要的东西是无法衡量的。有些改变体现在「你是谁」上，而不仅体现在「你能做什么」上。这个过程可能从外表上是看不出来的。它很难量化，甚至难以觉察。

许多研究关注的是「专长」，将其限定在客观的属性与能力方面。在这些研究看来，专长与获得专长的人是分开的。所谓专长，就是能够制作燕尾榫的木工手艺，或者把球投入篮筐的球技。但我更感兴趣的是人的内部发生了什么，成为专家的过程意味着什么，成为一位被同行、公众和外界认可的专家又意味着什么。我感兴趣的不是一个人如何制作燕尾榫，而是学习制作燕尾榫的时候发生了什么。

描述性的结论很少能提供行之有效的诀窍。如果你想成为专家，它们不会告诉你应该做什么准备，或者应该朝哪个方向努力。它们也不会告诉你可能需要多长时间，或者在途中会遇到什么问题。所以我把「学徒－熟练工－大师」的模型分解成了更小的步骤，也就是成为专家的诀窍。这些步骤构成了本书的章节。在前文的图中，我描绘了这些步骤与「学徒－熟练工－大师」框架的对应关系。当然，这些步骤并不总是按顺序进行的，不同阶段之间常有重叠，但它们阐明了大致的方向。

学徒：积累、运用感官、空间与他人

熟练工：「重点不在于你」、找到自己的声音

大师：传承技艺

### 0601. 基础卡

基础卡是最为基础的卡片，用于记录一些基础性事实、观点、故事等。基础卡常见的信息结构是：「标题 + 内容 + 评论」。「标题」指的是对卡片内容简明扼要的概括，类似卡片助记词，帮助你更好地记忆；「内容」指的是卡片正文，你可将阅读心得写成原文 + 评论或心得或想法或收获。基础卡举例如下：

{
标题：读《听听那冷雨》

原文：惊蛰一过，春寒加剧。先是料料峭峭，继而雨季开始，时而淋淋漓漓，时而渐渐沥沥，天潮潮地湿湿，即连在梦里，也似乎把伞撑着。而就凭一把伞，躲过一阵潇潇的冷雨，也躲不过整个雨季。连思想也都是潮润的。每天回家，曲折穿过金门街到厦门街迷宫式的长巷短巷，雨里风里，走入靠靠令人更想入非非。想这样子的台北凄凄切切完全是黑白片的味道，想整个中国整部中国的历史无非是一张黑白片子，片头到片尾，一直是这样下着雨的。

评论：余光中散文名篇《听听那冷雨》堪称白话文范文，将中文之美用到了极致，开篇「料料峭峭」「淋淋漓满」「渐渐沥沥」「凄凄切切」，又「天潮潮」「地湿湿」「潮润润」，又「惊蛰一过」「泰寒加剧」「雨季开始」。从头读到尾，毫不采板。

#### 6.1 基础卡 —— 专家与看不见的鱼

2023-12-30

原文：

我站在河岸上，让眼睛放松下来。渐渐地，我意识到，起初我以为的水面上的影子，其实是在水面下游动的鱼。我不知道是哪种鱼，但我意识到鱼就在那儿。我朋友从小就开始钓鱼了。他能把细微的线索联系起来，看出发生的事情。这些线索形成了一种语言，他能理解这种语言，而我却不能。水面上的涟漪、一闪而过的影子、闪烁的阳光、水面上苍蝇的飞行规律。他知道如何解释并理解这一切，甚至能据此区分不同种类的鱼。

评论：

有些专家很显眼，比如音乐家、建筑师、外科医生，有些专家在我们身边却往往不被注意，比如电工、木工、焊工。那些不被注意到的专家，他们就像水下游动的鱼，隐藏在我们的视线之外。

还有一点是专家那种可以关联各种信息发现水面下鱼的内隐知识。

参考：罗杰·尼伯恩.(2023).2023051精进之路-从新手到大师的心智升级之旅.(姜帆译).机械工业出版社 => 0101. 专家与看不见的鱼

唯一编码：202405262331

原文：

既然如此，你该如何判断一个人是不是专家？有时我们能一眼就认出专家。我们能看见他们的工作（音乐厅、剧院里的表演，展览中的展品，或者标本剥制师德里克这种人的作品），可以自己做出判断。有时我们信任他们的专业技能，却没有看到他们是如何工作的，比如外科医生、厨师或建筑师。这些专家似乎很神秘，我们大多数人都知道自己不可能做他们的工作。还有些专家就在我们身边，但往往不引人注目。我们让熟练的机械师修理汽车，让管道工为我们安装新浴室，而我们却很容易忽略这些人有多专业。因为汽车和浴室实在是太司空见惯了，以至于我们忽视了做好工作所需要的技能。我们把这种专长看作理所当然，几乎不会加以留心。然而，这类工作都是几十年经验积累的成果。我们认为专家的工作有多大价值，很大程度上与我们对这项工作的看法有关，因此时常产生误解。对很多人来说，外科医生、飞行员和钢琴家几乎是最顶尖的专家，而车库修理工、泥瓦匠和水管工则要低级些。然而，成为专家的本质 —— 找到问题核心的智慧、解决问题的技巧、判断与付出的关心，则不受这种毫无益处的贵贱之分的影响。

专家的价值受到低估，其中的一部分原因是熟悉 —— 或者恰恰相反。大多数人都不熟悉动物标本剥制，所以德里克的专业性则是显而易见的。粉刷天花板的粉刷匠，或制作窗框的木匠可能需要拥有同等程度的艺术造诣、技术与科学知识，然而天花板和窗框实在是太稀松平常了，以至于我们意识不到这些工匠有多专业。事实上，外科医生与木匠所需的灵活性与精确性惊人地相似。他们都需要付出艰辛的努力。然而那种将外科医生置于木匠之上的等级之见却掩盖了两者的共同之处。成为专家的关键与你的领域无关，而在于你必须做些什么才能达到精通。

因此，成为专家的方法对于我们所有人都适用。我们每个人都有自己的兴趣与技能，无论是开车还是打网球，出版还是会计，使用电脑键盘还是演奏乐器。但是，无论你是在写电子邮件还是创作交响乐，你都更容易发现别人是专家，却不容易有这样的自知。然而，尽管我们常常对专家视而不见，但如果我们用心去看，就能发现他们。

这就像观察大自然一样。有一天，我和一位老朋友沿着河岸散步。他酷爱垂钓，并试图向我讲解他的兴趣。「是否钓到鱼并不重要，」他告诉我，「重要的是去寻找。」我不明白他的意思。

当我们走到河湾处时，他指了指说：「在那儿，你看见了吗？」

我没看到什么东西，只有水面上的几片叶子上下浮动，还有在阳光下成群结队的苍蝇。「看，有很多。」他说，然后告诉我他发现的是哪种鱼。我一条也看不见。「放松点，看上一会儿，你也能看到它们。」他解释道。

我站在河岸上，让眼睛放松下来。渐渐地，我意识到，起初我以为的水面上的影子，其实是在水面下游动的鱼。我不知道是哪种鱼，但我意识到鱼就在那儿。我朋友从小就开始钓鱼了。他能把细微的线索联系起来，看出发生的事情。这些线索形成了一种语言，他能理解这种语言，而我却不能。水面上的涟漪、一闪而过的影子、闪烁的阳光、水面上苍蝇的飞行规律。他知道如何解释并理解这一切，甚至能据此区分不同种类的鱼。

专家就像这些看不见的鱼 —— 他们就在我们身边，却藏在我们的眼皮底下。他们往往对自己的成就非常谦虚，甚至几乎不承认自己的成就。在本书里，我将像我的朋友那样，指出生活在我们身边的看不见的鱼。我会阐述如何发现专家，探讨他们的共同特征，并讨论这些东西对我们自己的生活有何启示。

研究专家很难。他们往往说不清楚自己做了什么。他们工作的诀窍已经成了无意识的习惯 —— 连他们也不知道，几乎无法用语言来表达。但是，他们往往可以展示给你看。当你参观他们的演播室、工作室、表演现场、诊所或手术室时，你就能看到他们工作的样子。即便如此，要理解他们工作的精妙之处、他们做出的判断与他们在工作中的智慧依然很难。

你可能想知道如何找到这样的专家：他们的工作能与你产生共鸣，他们的经验能给予你启发。如果专家是看不见的鱼，那你怎么能找到他们呢？一种方法是去你知道的鱼会出没的地方，找一处鱼群聚集的河湾。英国的艺术工作者行会（Art Workers's Guild）就是这样的一个地方。

### Acknowledgements

Expert draws on conversations and collaborations with countless people over several decades. Though I cannot mention all those people by name, my debt to them is incalculable. As anyone who has compiled an invitation list of fairy godmothers will be painfully aware, there is always a danger of forgetting someone who should have been included. If I have done that, I hope I will escape the traditional consequences of such an omission.

In this book, I draw on many experts. They have been extraordinarily generous with their time, their insights and their encouragement, and they have influenced my thinking profoundly. Some appear and reappear throughout my story. Joshua Byrne has shaped my thinking since we first met over ten years ago, and our conversations form the foundation of this book. Fleur Oakes, Richard McDougall, Will Houstoun, Fabrice Ringuet and Sophie Yates have helped me think in new ways about the steps on the path to becoming expert.

Paul Jakeman, Andrew Davidson, Derek Frampton, Duncan Hooson, Phil Bayman, Katharine Coleman, John Launer and Jozef Youssef have all shone light from different perspectives. Andrew Garlick, Alan Spivey, Kirsty Flower, Marta Ajmar, Merlin Strangeway, Liam Noble, Lucy Lyons, David Dolan, Jeremy Jackman, Rachel Warr, David Owen, Dimitri Bellos, Margot Cooper, Sam Gallivan, Florence Thomas, Harold Ellis, Mary Neiland and Colin Bicknell have helped me develop my ideas.

I have mentioned Thread Management, an event at the Art Workers' Guild. Other events include Thinking with Your Hands and a symposium at Imperial which I called The Art of Performing Science. These, too, have shaped my thinking and provided rich soil for my ideas. Through film and conversation, Paul Craddock has played a central role in all of these events.

A pivotal figure in my thinking has been the semiotician and educator Gunther Kress, who died suddenly in June 2019. Our conversations, which took place over more than a decade, were instrumental in developing my ideas for this book. Gunther was a mentor, an inspiration and a true friend. I miss him more than I can say.

I have also been inspired by John Wickham, the pioneering urologist whose work I describe in the book's closing sections. John died in October 2017 at the age of eighty-nine. To me, he captured what being expert is about. Gentle, modest and humane, he too was an inspiration and a friend. His colleagues Mike Kellett, Stuart Greengrass, Chris Russell and Toni Raybould have been immensely helpful, and John's widow Ann has been generosity itself.

Many friends have helped my thinking, especially Julia Anderson. Further back still, my mentors Aylwyn Mannell, Andy Hall and Jeremy Duncan Brown inspired and supported me during my clinical careers. I received unfailing support from my GP partners at Lovemead Group Practice in Trowbridge, Wiltshire – especially Jeremy Bradbrooke and the late Stephen Henry.

I am deeply indebted to the Art Workers' Guild, the extraordinary organization I first mentioned at the start of this book. Many of the experts whose stories I draw on are Brothers (as they are traditionally called, irrespective of gender) of the Guild. As individuals, their insights have been illuminating. As a group, they have made me think in unexpected ways. Being invited to join as a Brother myself has been an honour. Particular thanks must go to Prue Cooper, potter and Past Master of the Guild.

I thank my many colleagues at Imperial College London and beyond, including Fernando Bello, Kirsten Dalrymple and Debra Nestel – long-standing friends and collaborators. I also thank Aaron Williamon of the Royal College of Music – friend, colleague, and joint director with me of the RCM–Imperial Centre for Performance Science.

I thank, too, the staff and students on the Imperial Master in Education (MEd) in Surgical Education and the academics and doctoral students who have helped me develop my ideas. They include Anne Yeh, Sacha Harris, Alex Cope, Tamzin Cuming, Sharon Weldon, Claudia Schlegel and Jeff Bezemer. I thank Barry Smith for his generosity with ideas and insights. And I thank the Wellcome Trust, whose 2012 Engagement Fellowship gave me the freedom to explore the ideas which developed into this book. That opportunity was transformative.

I am indebted to the City and Guilds of London Art School, the Royal Academy of Arts, Gresham College, and many museums and institutions in the UK and overseas for giving me the opportunity to develop my ideas. Also my friend Will Liddell, who first alerted me to the existence of invisible fish.

Next I must thank Jack Ramm, my editor. Jack's contribution has been immense. His commitment, clarity of thought, and support for me as an author – in a word, his care – have been extraordinary. It has been a privilege to work with him. My thanks also to Connor Brown and all the staff at Penguin Books.

Finally, to my family. My daughters Emily and Rachel have been both enthusiastic and encouraging, and with them I have explored many ideas that cross disciplinary boundaries.

The greatest debt of all is to my wife, Dusia. Words are wholly inadequate to express the support and inspiration she has given me. I dedicate this book to her.

1 Experts and invisible fish

1 When I use these terms with an initial capital letter I'm referring to this common-sense use, without having to keep specifying that terms like ‘journeyman' are nowadays gender-neutral. I'll use lower case for current usage, such as apprenticeship programmes in industry or when talking about mastery in other contexts.

## 0101. 专家与看不见的鱼

0101 Experts and invisible fish

When I visited Derek Frampton, he was posing a clouded leopard. I'd never seen a clouded leopard before. She was sitting like a cat, her tail curled round her, gazing at a tiny cub which looked as if it was about to run away and play. They were so realistic I could hardly believe they were stuffed.

Derek is a taxidermist, one of the best there is. He'd invited me to his house to see how he works. We were in his ‘display room', full to bursting with animals of every kind. Glass cases of birds and reptiles, every surface covered with creatures. On one table was a parakeet nearing completion, its wings held in position by threads; on another was an alligator with its jaws about to snap shut, next to a tree frog glowing like a jewel in the sunlight. Apart from the eerie stillness, it was like being in a menagerie.

I'd arranged to visit Derek because he's one of the country's leading experts in his field. I'm interested in experts and I wanted to find out more. Moving a half-finished skink from a chair so I could sit down, Derek explained what taxidermy involves.

He made the process sound pretty straightforward. You remove the animal's skin, recreate its body shape with a plaster model and place the skin over the model. He showed me a zebra's hide, shapeless and slumped in a corner. When I asked how he would create the plaster shape for those final stages, he said, ‘Well, you just sculpt a zebra that size and put the skin back on.'

It's that ‘just' that's key. If you want a zebra, you just sculpt one that size. It's obvious. But to me it isn't obvious, it's unimaginable. It's what makes Derek an expert.

Taxidermy is not a science, a craft or an art, Derek told me. It's a practice which combines all three. The science is in the precision, close observation and accuracy which allow his work to be a reference point for scientific research. Zoologists may refer to Derek's specimens for years to come, so the precise details of a mammal's colouring, a fish's scales or a reptile's teeth might be crucial in identifying new species or tracking the decline of animal populations. The craft is in the skills Derek has built up throughout his career: his ability to take the skin off an animal, then recreate that specimen's unique shape in plaster or wax. And the art is what brings it all together, making that clouded leopard look as if she's about to stoop down and lick her little cub. It's because he's an expert that Derek can combine these strands, applying them with wisdom and care to each new situation. Becoming expert is what this book is about.

我去拜访德里克·弗兰普顿（Derek Frampton）的时候，他正在给一只云豹的标本设计造型。我以前从没见过云豹。它像猫一样坐着，尾巴环绕着身子，凝视着一只幼崽，看起来那只幼崽好像要跑开去玩了。它们实在是太逼真了，我简直不敢相信它们体内已经塞满了填充物。

德里克是一名标本剥制师，而且是个中翘楚。他邀我去他家，看看他是如何工作的。我们来到了他的「陈列室」，里面摆满了各种各样的动物。玻璃柜里有各种鸟类与爬行动物，屋里每一处能放东西的地方都摆满了各种生物。在一张桌子上，放着一只快要完成的长尾小鹦鹉，它的翅膀被丝线固定住了；在另一张桌子上，有一只短吻鳄正准备撕咬，它旁边则是一只树蛙，在阳光下像宝石一样闪闪发光。除了有种怪异的寂静之外，这里就像动物园一样。

我之所以拜访德里克，是因为他是英国该领域内的顶尖专家之一。我对专家很感兴趣，想了解更多有关他们的事情。德里克把一只还未完工的石龙子标本从椅子上挪开，让我坐下来，为我讲解标本剥制的工作。

他把这项工作讲得很简单。剥掉动物的皮，用石膏模型重塑身体形态，再把皮盖在石膏上就行了。他给我看了一张斑马的皮，没有形状，耷拉在角落里。我问他在最后阶段如何制作石膏模型，他说道：「这个嘛，只要雕刻一匹那么大的斑马，然后把皮蒙上去就行了。」

「只要」就是其中的关键。如果你想制作斑马的标本，只要雕刻一个那么大的模型就好了。显而易见。但对我来说，这可没那么显而易见，而是完全无法想象的。这就是为什么德里克是专家。

德里克告诉我，标本剥制不只是一门科学、工艺或艺术，而是三者的结合。科学性体现在其中的精确性、准确性以及密切的观察上，这使得他的工作成为科学研究的参考。动物学家可能会在之后的很多年里都需要参考德里克的标本，所以像是哺乳动物的颜色、鱼的鳞片或是爬行动物的牙齿这类细节，对于识别新物种或是追踪动物数量的减少，可能都是至关重要的。

标本剥制的工艺性，则体现在德里克在整个职业生涯中锻炼出来的技能上；他能从动物身上把皮剥下来，然后用石膏或蜡重塑标本的独特形态。艺术性则将所有的要素结合起来，让这只云豹看上去像要弯下腰去舔它的幼崽。正因为德里克是个专家，所以他可以凭借智慧与细心，将这三者结合起来并加以运用，遇到任何新情况都能得心应手。本书的主题，就是如何成为专家。

### 1.1 成为专家

Becoming expert

I'm a doctor. Medicine, too, is not a science, a craft or an art, but a practice which combines all three. Of course it is founded on science, that factual knowledge I spent so long studying as a student. The craft is how I worked as a practitioner, examining patients, operating on them or talking with them in my consulting room. The art is how I made sense of each patient and the problems they brought to me. The connection between Derek and me might not seem obvious at first, since surely taxidermy and medicine are completely different worlds. But that's not the case at all.

After explaining the basics, Derek took me into his workshop, which was like an alchemist's laboratory. The room was full of works in progress and there were all sorts of animals – birds and mammals, fish and reptiles. Creatures large and small, at every stage of preparation. An edible dormouse was on his workbench, a gorilla's head hung on the wall, and an antelope's torso stood in a corner. The air smelled of glue and plaster, and gurgling noises came from the next room.

In the centre of the room was the wooden cabinet where Derek keeps his most precious tools, the ones he inherited from his master. He only has a few and he's been using them for decades. The cabinet is the size of a wind-up gramophone and has two brass-handled drawers. On top is a turntable, where a tiny clay frog lay next to some of Derek's sculpting instruments. Rotating the turntable slowly by hand, Derek can work on specimens like that frog without damaging them. All around are the materials he needs. His workshop is where the science, craft and art come together.

Derek has been a taxidermist for forty-five years, mounting (‘setting up', he calls it) everything from giraffes to shrews, from Komodo dragons to fish. He's in high demand by museums, zoos and private collectors. Though much of his work is with new specimens, he also conserves examples from scientific collections of animals and birds that are now disappearing or even extinct. Expert taxidermists, like many of the animals they work with, are rare creatures indeed.

I asked Derek how he started his career. At school, he told me, he loved art. He was good with his hands but he's dyslexic and he found studying difficult. When he was twelve he came across a dead blackbird on the road, took it home and started to draw it. He was fascinated by the bird's anatomy, by the delicate mechanism of its wings. From then on, he collected as many dead animals as his mother would let him get away with, drawing and painting them as accurately as he could. His epiphany, as he described it, came when he was sixteen. One day he realized that he didn't have to draw these animals as he found them; instead, he could pose them. He never looked back. He joined the Natural History Museum in London as an apprentice taxidermist, working there for many years before striking out on his own.

Not everyone can become an expert taxidermist like Derek. Not everyone would want to. Yet finding out how Derek and others like him in different fields have become so expert is relevant to all of us. What does it mean to be an expert? How do you become one? What makes Derek an expert , rather than just someone who is very good at what he does?

We can all become expert at something, though we probably can't become really expert in more than one or two areas. To become an expert you have to concentrate on your selected field, pushing distractions aside and focusing intently for year after year. It's a long, demanding process that takes great effort, and there's a lot of frustration along the way. This sounds obvious, but it's something people often overlook. We live in a world that demands immediate results. We are also taught to believe that talent is innate, and that if you don't show flair for something, it isn't worth pursuing. I don't think either of those things is true. Moving along the path towards becoming expert brings its own rewards: the slow march towards mastery is deeply satisfying – and, as we'll discover, it meets a fundamental human need. Besides which, you won't find out how talented you are until you try.

我是一名医生。医学也不只是一门科学、工艺或艺术，而是三者的结合。当然，医学建立在科学的基础之上，那是我在学生时代花了很长时间学习的事实性知识。工艺性则指我的工作方式：检查患者、给他们做手术，或者在诊室里与他们谈话。艺术性则体现在我如何理解每个患者，如何理解他们前来求医的主诉。德里克与我之间的联系，起初看起来可能并不明显，因为标本剥制与医学肯定是两个截然不同的领域，但事实并非如此。解释完基本内容之后，德里克带我去了他的工作室，那里就像是炼金术士的实验室一样。房间里堆满了半成品，其中有各种各样的动物 —— 鸟类、哺乳动物、鱼类和爬行动物。大大小小的生物标本，处于各种不同的制作阶段。工作台上放着一只榛睡鼠，墙上挂着一只大猩猩的头，角落里放着一只羚羊的躯干。空气中弥漫着胶水和石膏的气味，隔壁房间里传来咕咕的声音。

房间的中央有一个木制的橱柜，德里克把他从师父那里继承来的最珍贵的工具都放在那里。他只有几件工具而已，但已经用了几十年。这个橱柜的大小与上发条的留声机类似，有两个带黄铜把手的抽屉。橱柜上面则有一张转盘，转盘上有一只小小的黏土青蛙，躺在德里克的雕塑工具旁边。只需用手慢慢转动转盘，德里克在制作青蛙这样的标本时就不至于失手损伤它们了。周围都是他需要的东西。他的工作室里汇集了科学、工艺与艺术。德里克做标本剥制师已经有 45 年之久了，他制作（他称之为「组装」）过各种动物，从长颈鹿到鼩鼱，从科莫多巨蜥到鱼类。他的作品在博物馆、动物园和私人收藏家中大受欢迎。尽管他大部分的工作都是在制作新标本，但他也保存着濒临灭绝或已经消失的动物和鸟类标本，以供科学收藏之用。标本剥制专家确实就像他制作的许多动物一样，是稀有生物。

我问过德里克是如何进入这一行的。他告诉我，他在上学时就很热爱艺术。他的手很巧，但他有阅读障碍，学习对他来说很困难。12 岁时，他在路上发现一只死乌鸫，就把它带回家去画。那只鸟的身体结构、精致的翅膀让他深深地着迷。从那时起，只要母亲允许，他就会尽可能多地收集动物尸体，并尽可能精确地画出来。用他的话说，他在 16 岁的时候突然开窍了。有一天，他意识到自己不必把他找到的动物画在纸上，而是让它们摆出各种姿态。从那以后，他就在这条路上走了下去，再也没有回头。他进入了伦敦自然历史博物馆，成了一名标本剥制学徒，在那里工作了很多年之后，他就开始独立工作了。

并非人人都能像德里克那样成为标本剥制专家。并非人人都愿意做这个。然而，了解德里克以及其他像他一样的人，如何在不同的领域内成为专家，却与我们所有人息息相关。成为专家意味着什么？你怎样才能成为专家？是什么让德里克成为专家，而不仅仅是一个非常擅长他那行的人？

我们都可以成为某方面的专家，不过，我们也许只能在一两个领域内成为专家。要成为专家，你就必须专注于你选择的领域，排除各种干扰，年复一年地专注于此。这是一个漫长而艰辛的过程，需要付出极大的努力，而且中途也会遇到许多挫折。这似乎是显而易见的，但人们常常忽略这一点。我们生活在一个功利的世界里，需要立竿见影的成果。我们所受的教育让我们相信，天赋是与生俱来的，如果你在某件事上没有天赋，在那件事上耗费精力就是不值得的。我认为这两件事都不是事实。成为专家的旅程本身就是一种回报：一步一个脚印地逐渐走向精通，本身就能令人感到深深的满足 —— 而且，我们还会发现，这个过程能够满足人类的基本需求。此外，如果你不试一试，你就不会发现你有多少天赋。

### 1.2 关于本书

This book

This book is about experts and what it is to become one. I've been fascinated by experts for as long as I can remember. I've spent years watching them, talking to them, working with them, thinking about them, learning from them and marvelling at them. In the last few years I've made this a focus of my university teaching and research. I've read what others have written and I've explored theories of how people become expert, whether as an individual or in a group. I've spent countless hours with some of the world's leading experts in many different fields. I've tried to fathom what makes them what they are. Throughout all of this, it's the people who have caught my imagination – not ‘expertise' in an abstracted sense, but the experts themselves.

Having expertise is one thing. Being expert is another. Am I an expert? It probably looks that way from the outside. It's over forty years since I qualified as a doctor. As I'll explain in the next chapter, since then I trained as a consultant surgeon and spent years operating on patients in the UK and South Africa. Then for nearly two decades I was a family doctor in a country town in the south-west of England. Now I'm a professor at Imperial College London, where I divide my time between teaching and research, much of it about experts. But I don't feel expert. To me it seems as if I'm just beginning to make sense of all that experience. Having said that, many experts I've spoken to describe a similar feeling.

Much of what experts do is invisible, even to themselves. Being expert is about how you think and see things. It's the result of an internal process that establishes who you are; it's not simply defined by what you create. We seldom see how experts become expert. We might experience what they make or do, but we don't see how they got there. We watch someone perform a trumpet solo in a concert hall, but we don't see the lifetime of practice behind their flawless execution. When we look at a painting in a gallery, we're not seeing the thousands of studies that led to it. But if you want to be an expert, you have to go through a long process. This book describes that process.

I've tried to work out what makes experts expert. I've tried to put into words their apparent ease, their mastery of materials, their instinctive judgement, their ways of knowing and doing, and their ability to respond to the unexpected. I've tried to capture their commitment to something beyond themselves. This is a tall order. Being expert is something you do, not something you describe. Much of it is impossible to put into words. It's only when you've tried to do their work yourself that you get a sense of how skilled such experts really are. Theirs is the art that conceals art.

It's like the apocryphal story of the elderly boilermaker who is hired to fix a heating system that has stopped working. He arrives at the site, asks a few questions, listens to the system, takes out a hammer from his overalls and gives a sharp tap to one of the pipes. The system starts working and he goes home. The whole thing has taken a few minutes. Then he sends a bill for £500. The client is outraged at being charged so much for just using a hammer and asks him to itemize the bill. He replies: ‘For use of hammer: £5. For knowing where to hit: £495.'

这本书讨论的是专家，以及如何成为专家。我对专家着迷，已经不知道有多少年了。多年来，我观察专家，与他们交流，与他们一起工作，思考与他们有关的问题，向他们学习，为他们惊叹。在过去的几年里，我把专家作为我在大学里教学与研究的重点。我读过别人写的文献，也研究过如何成为专家的理论 —— 无论是独立地成为专家，还是在群体中成为专家。我花了无数时间，与世界上许多不同领域的顶尖专家一同工作。我想弄明白他们是如何走到今天这一步的。在这一切里，最让我产生遐想的是人本身 —— 不是抽象意义上的「专长」，而是专家本身。拥有专长是一回事，成为专家是另一回事。我是专家吗？从表面上看可能是的。我取得行医资格已有 40 多年了。我会在下一章讲到，我学医以后，接受过外科顾问医师的培训，并且在英国和南非为患者做过很多年的手术。后来，我在英格兰西南部的一个小镇上做了近 20 年的家庭医生。现在，我是伦敦帝国理工学院的一名教授，把时间花在教学和研究上，而大部分时间都放在了专家的问题上。但是我不觉得自己是个专家。在我看来，我似乎才刚刚开始理解我的所有经历。话虽如此，我采访过的许多专家都有类似的感觉。

专家所做的很多事情都是看不见的，甚至连他们自己也看不见。成为专家的关键，在于你思考和看待事物的方式，在于决定「你是谁」的内部过程所导致的结果，而不仅仅在于你所创造的事物。我们很少能看到专家是如何成为专家的。我们可能会看到他们的所作所为，但我们看不见他们是如何取得这些成就的。我们能看到有人在音乐厅里演奏小号，但我们看不到他们在这次完美表演背后，有着一辈子的练习。我们在画廊里欣赏一幅画的时候，看到的并不是催生这幅作品的无数研究。

但是，如果你想成为专家，就必须经历一个漫长的过程。本书讲的就是这个过程。

我一直在试图弄明白专家何以成为专家。我曾尝试用语言来描述他们外表的从容、对专业内容的掌握、本能的判断、认知与行事的方式，以及他们对意外事件做出反应的能力。我还想要理解他们对于那些超越自身的事物的投入。这些可不容易。

成为专家是实实在在的行为，而不是用语言能说清楚的。其中有许多东西是无法用语言表达的。只有当你试着去做他们所做的事情时，才能体会到这些专家的技能有多娴熟。他们所擅长的技艺，便是深藏不露的技艺。

这就像那个杜撰的故事一样：一个年长的锅炉工被请去修理一套失灵的供暖系统。他来到现场，问了几个问题，听了系统运行的声音，从工作服里拿出一把锤子，对着一根管道用力敲了一下。系统恢复了正常，他就回家了。整个过程只花了几分钟，而他后来寄来的账单却要价 500 英镑。顾客感到很愤怒，要求他列出详细的账单，因为他仅仅挥了一下锤子，就要收取这么高的费用。他回复道：「挥动锤子 —— 5 英镑，知道敲哪里 —— 495 英镑。」

### 1.3 看不见的鱼

Invisible fish

So how can you tell if someone is an expert? Sometimes we recognize experts immediately. We experience their work and can judge it for ourselves – in concert halls or theatres or exhibitions, or in work by people like Derek the taxidermist. Sometimes we trust in their expertise without seeing how they do it, as with surgeons, chefs or architects. Such experts seem mysterious, and most of us know we could never do their work ourselves.

Other experts are all around us, though we often fail to notice them. When we have our car fixed by a skilled mechanic, or a new bathroom installed by a master plumber, it's easy to miss how expert these people really are. Because cars and bathrooms are so familiar, we overlook the skill required to do a good job. We take this expertise for granted and hardly register it. Yet work of this kind is the fruit of decades of experience.

The perceived value of an expert's work has a lot to do with how we judge it, and this can be misleading. For many people, surgeons, airline pilots and concert pianists come fairly near the top, while garage mechanics, plasterers and plumbers come further down. Yet the essence of being expert – that wisdom that allows you to get to the heart of a problem and fix it with skill, judgement and care – cuts across these unhelpful hierarchies.

Part of the undervaluing of experts is because of familiarity – or its opposite. Taxidermy is so far outside most people's experience that Derek's expertise is plain to see. A plasterer skimming a ceiling or a carpenter making window frames may require an equal amount of artistry, craft and science to do a good job, yet because ceilings and window frames seem so ordinary we fail to recognize how expert these craftsmen are. In fact, the dexterity and precision of a surgeon and a joiner are surprisingly similar. They will both have walked a gruelling path. Yet the hierarchies that place surgery above joinery hide the common ground they share. The point about being expert is not the field you are in but what you have to do to get there.

Becoming expert, therefore, applies to us all. We each have our own interests and skills, whether driving or playing tennis, publishing or accountancy, using a computer keyboard or playing a musical instrument. But being expert is easier to recognize in others than in ourselves, whether you are composing emails or composing symphonies. Yet although experts often go unnoticed, we can spot them if we think to look.

It's like observing the natural world. One day I was walking along a riverbank with an old friend. He's a keen angler, and he was trying to explain his passion. ‘It's not really about catching the fish,' he told me, ‘it's about looking.' I didn't understand what he meant. When we reached a bend in the river, he pointed and said, ‘There, do you see them?' I couldn't see anything special, just the water with a few leaves bobbing up and down and some flies swarming in the sunshine. ‘Look, loads of them,' he said, and he told me the type of fish he'd spotted. I couldn't see a single one. ‘Just relax and look a while, and you'll see them too,' he explained.

As I stood on the bank, I let my gaze soften. Gradually I realized that what I'd thought were surface shadows were in fact fish flitting underneath. I couldn't identify what kind, but I became aware that they were there. My friend had been fishing since he was a child. He could put together the tiny clues that told him what was happening. They formed a language that he could understand but I couldn't. Ripples in the water, fleeting shadows, the glint of the sun, the pattern of the flies darting above the surface. He knew how to interpret all of this and make sense of it, even telling one species of fish from another.

Experts are like these invisible fish – all around us but hiding in plain sight. Often they are so modest about their accomplishments that they hardly acknowledge them. In this book I will be like my friend was that day, pointing out the invisible fish that surround us and live within us. I'll describe how to recognize experts, explore the characteristics they share, and ask what we can learn for our own lives.

Researching experts is a challenge. They often struggle to explain what they do. Their work has become unconscious – inaccessible even to them, and almost impossible to put into words. But they can usually show you. When you visit them in their studio, workshop, performance space, clinic or operating theatre, you can watch them at work. Even then, it's difficult to grasp the subtlety of what they do, to understand the judgements they make and the wisdom they bring to their work.

You might wonder how to find experts whose work resonates with your own and whose experience can shed light on yours. If experts are invisible fish, how can you see them? One approach is to go where you know fish will be, to find a bend in the river where they congregate. One such place in the United Kingdom is the Art Workers' Guild.

I found the Guild quite by chance. I was wandering through Bloomsbury in central London some years ago and ended up in Queen Square. This site is well known in medical circles because of some famous hospitals, including Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children and the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery. My eye was caught by a beautifully painted sign over the door of No. 6 saying ‘Art Workers' Guild'. It happened to be Open Garden Squares Weekend in London, when hundreds of organizations throw open their doors to passers-by. No. 6 Queen Square's was ajar. I stepped in and found myself in another world.

I discovered that the Art Workers' Guild was started in 1884 by young designers and architects who wanted to bring the fine and applied arts together on equal terms. This was the time of the Arts and Crafts movement, and William Morris – the artist, textile designer, writer and social activist who was one of its leading figures – was an early Master of the Guild. Now the Guild includes experts in over sixty fields, from pottery to botanical illustration, portrait sculpture to architectural drawing, ornamental plasterwork to jewellery-making. In most groups of experts – a society of silversmiths, say, or glass blowers, or printers, or doctors – all members are from the same profession. The Art Workers' Guild is quite the opposite. Its membership is very broad, and many of the experts I'll introduce in this book are among them.

I became fascinated by these Art Workers. As individuals, they are all highly skilled – only those at the top of their field are invited to join the Guild. As a group, they share a belief in the importance of doing good work and also a quiet pride in having spent years mastering a difficult craft. All of them are unusual; many are downright eccentric. In the years that followed my first visit, I spent more and more time with them, and eventually I was invited to join the Guild myself.

Spending time with them and other experts – including the ones you'll meet in this book – gave me an insight into their work. I began to see parallels between their experiences and mine, even though none of them do anything connected with medicine. I was able to test out ideas about the path to becoming expert – ideas which evolved into the ones you'll encounter in this book. I've had the experience of walking down a path towards becoming expert in my life as a doctor, and I found this image resonated with others too.

既然如此，你该如何判断一个人是不是专家？有时我们能一眼就认出专家。我们能看见他们的工作（音乐厅、剧院里的表演，展览中的展品，或者标本剥制师德里克这种人的作品），可以自己做出判断。有时我们信任他们的专业技能，却没有看到他们是如何工作的，比如外科医生、厨师或建筑师。这些专家似乎很神秘，我们大多数人都知道自己不可能做他们的工作。还有些专家就在我们身边，但往往不引人注目。我们让熟练的机械师修理汽车，让管道工为我们安装新浴室，而我们却很容易忽略这些人有多专业。因为汽车和浴室实在是太司空见惯了，以至于我们忽视了做好工作所需要的技能。我们把这种专长看作理所当然，几乎不会加以留心。然而，这类工作都是几十年经验积累的成果。我们认为专家的工作有多大价值，很大程度上与我们对这项工作的看法有关，因此时常产生误解。对很多人来说，外科医生、飞行员和钢琴家几乎是最顶尖的专家，而车库修理工、泥瓦匠和水管工则要低级些。然而，成为专家的本质 —— 找到问题核心的智慧、解决问题的技巧、判断与付出的关心，则不受这种毫无益处的贵贱之分的影响。

专家的价值受到低估，其中的一部分原因是熟悉 —— 或者恰恰相反。大多数人都不熟悉动物标本剥制，所以德里克的专业性则是显而易见的。粉刷天花板的粉刷匠，或制作窗框的木匠可能需要拥有同等程度的艺术造诣、技术与科学知识，然而天花板和窗框实在是太稀松平常了，以至于我们意识不到这些工匠有多专业。事实上，外科医生与木匠所需的灵活性与精确性惊人地相似。他们都需要付出艰辛的努力。然而那种将外科医生置于木匠之上的等级之见却掩盖了两者的共同之处。成为专家的关键与你的领域无关，而在于你必须做些什么才能达到精通。

因此，成为专家的方法对于我们所有人都适用。我们每个人都有自己的兴趣与技能，无论是开车还是打网球，出版还是会计，使用电脑键盘还是演奏乐器。但是，无论你是在写电子邮件还是创作交响乐，你都更容易发现别人是专家，却不容易有这样的自知。然而，尽管我们常常对专家视而不见，但如果我们用心去看，就能发现他们。

这就像观察大自然一样。有一天，我和一位老朋友沿着河岸散步。他酷爱垂钓，并试图向我讲解他的兴趣。「是否钓到鱼并不重要，」他告诉我，「重要的是去寻找。」我不明白他的意思。

当我们走到河湾处时，他指了指说：「在那儿，你看见了吗？」

我没看到什么东西，只有水面上的几片叶子上下浮动，还有在阳光下成群结队的苍蝇。「看，有很多。」他说，然后告诉我他发现的是哪种鱼。我一条也看不见。「放松点，看上一会儿，你也能看到它们。」他解释道。

我站在河岸上，让眼睛放松下来。渐渐地，我意识到，起初我以为的水面上的影子，其实是在水面下游动的鱼。我不知道是哪种鱼，但我意识到鱼就在那儿。我朋友从小就开始钓鱼了。他能把细微的线索联系起来，看出发生的事情。这些线索形成了一种语言，他能理解这种语言，而我却不能。水面上的涟漪、一闪而过的影子、闪烁的阳光、水面上苍蝇的飞行规律。他知道如何解释并理解这一切，甚至能据此区分不同种类的鱼。

专家就像这些看不见的鱼 —— 他们就在我们身边，却藏在我们的眼皮底下。他们往往对自己的成就非常谦虚，甚至几乎不承认自己的成就。在本书里，我将像我的朋友那样，指出生活在我们身边的看不见的鱼。我会阐述如何发现专家，探讨他们的共同特征，并讨论这些东西对我们自己的生活有何启示。

研究专家很难。他们往往说不清楚自己做了什么。他们工作的诀窍已经成了无意识的习惯 —— 连他们也不知道，几乎无法用语言来表达。但是，他们往往可以展示给你看。当你参观他们的演播室、工作室、表演现场、诊所或手术室时，你就能看到他们工作的样子。即便如此，要理解他们工作的精妙之处、他们做出的判断与他们在工作中的智慧依然很难。

你可能想知道如何找到这样的专家：他们的工作能与你产生共鸣，他们的经验能给予你启发。如果专家是看不见的鱼，那你怎么能找到他们呢？一种方法是去你知道的鱼会出没的地方，找一处鱼群聚集的河湾。英国的艺术工作者行会（Art Workers's Guild）就是这样的一个地方。

我是偶然间发现这个行会的。几年前，我在伦敦市中心的布鲁姆斯伯里区闲逛，最后来到了女王广场。这个地方在医学界很有名，因为这里有一些著名的医院，包括大奥蒙德街儿童医院和英国国家神经病学与神经外科医院。6 号楼大门上「艺术工作者行会」的漂亮标语吸引了我的目光。那天刚好是伦敦的「花园广场开放日」，那里的数百家组织都会向路人敞开大门。女王广场 6 号的大门半开着。我走了进去，发现自己来到了另一个世界。

我了解到，艺术工作者行会是由一批年轻的设计师和建筑师于 1884 年建立的。他们希望将美术与应用艺术平等地结合在一起。那是工艺美术运动的时代，而艺术家、纺织品设计师、作家和社会活动家威廉·莫里斯（William Morris）则是行会早年间的会长。现在，该行会会集了 60 多个领域的专家，从陶器到植物插画，从人像雕塑到建筑绘画，从装饰性石膏到珠宝制作，应有尽有。在大多数专家团体中（包括银匠、玻璃吹制工、印刷工或医生团体），所有成员都从事同一行当。艺术工作者行会恰恰相反。其会员遍及各行各业，我将在本书中介绍的许多专家都是该行会的成员。

这些艺术工作者深深地吸引了我。作为独立的工作者，他们都有高超的技能 —— 只有在各自领域成为佼佼者才会受到邀请加入行会。作为一个团体，他们都相信精益求精的重要性，并且都为经年累月掌握一门艰深的手艺而感到骄傲。他们都不是寻常人，许多人非常古怪。自从我首次拜访那里之后，我和他们打交道的时间越来越多，最后我也应邀加入了行会。

与这些艺术工作者和其他专家（包括你会在本书中见到的专家）打交道，让我了解了他们的工作。虽然他们的工作与医学没有任何关系，但我开始发现他们的经历与我有相似之处。我可以借此机会验证如何成为专家的想法 —— 这些想法演变成了你会在本书中看到的理念。在医生的职业生涯里，我已经历过成为专家的过程，我发现这张图与其他领域也有共通之处。

### 1.4 学艺模型

对学艺模型（apprenticeship model）做个详细的介绍，深呼吸，一步一步思考

The apprenticeship model

At the heart of this book is the apprenticeship model. This has been widespread throughout Europe for centuries and has counterparts all around the world. Many people associate it with the medieval guild system for becoming a craftsman (a long-established term, which now of course applies equally to men and women, and which for convenience I will use throughout this book). Although many apprenticeship systems in the UK are being eradicated by social, political and industrial change, the model remains useful for our thinking. Historically it has referred to learning a craft or a trade, but for me it applies to experts of every kind – from taxidermists to teachers, plumbers to pilots. It's a model that most people understand intuitively, even if they haven't thought about it in detail. Crucially, it captures the idea of progression. I'll use this model as a framework throughout this book.

Traditionally there are three phases – Apprentice, Journeyman and Master. fn1 Of course, social conditions nowadays are radically different from those of medieval Europe. Apprentices no longer sleep behind the stove in their master's house or work for years without pay. But these stages provide a road map for anyone who wants to become expert.

Apprentice. You start by knowing nothing. You watch and copy others, learning to do things as they are already done in your master's workshop. Responsibility for your work and any mistakes you make lies with your master, and so does any credit for the work you do.

Journeyman. You launch your career as an independent expert. You leave your master's workshop and move around the country. Now you take responsibility for your own work, and you have to deal with the consequences of error. You continue to gain experience, refining and extending your skills and developing your individuality.

Master. Finally you set up a workshop of your own and teach others. You pass on your knowledge and expertise to future generations. You do what you can to look after the individuals who are learning from you; you have a sense of stewardship towards your field more widely; sometimes you even take the field itself in new directions.

These three phases are a useful way to think about the acquisition of skill. But they are descriptive, not explanatory. They identify points on a path, but they don't show you how to reach those points or how to know when you've got there. They divide the process into segments and treat these as if they were static. They measure what can be measured. But much that is important can't be measured. There are changes in who you are, not just what you can do. This process may be invisible from the outside. It's difficult to quantify, and may even go unnoticed from within.

Much research has focused on ‘expertise', framing it in terms of impersonal attributes and capacities. Expertise is seen as separate from the person who acquires it. Expertise is being able to make a dovetail joint or put a basketball into the net. But I'm interested in what happens internally, in what it means to become expert, then become an expert, recognized by peers, the public and the outside world. I'm interested in what happens to that person when they learn to make a dovetail joint, rather than how they make the joint itself.

Descriptions seldom give an insider's point of view. They don't tell you what to expect if you want to become expert yourself, or where to place your effort. And they don't tell you how long it's likely to take, or the problems you'll encounter on the way. So I've broken down the Apprentice–Journeyman–Master model into smaller steps – the inside story of becoming expert. These steps form the chapters of the book. In the diagram on page 13 I've mapped them onto the Apprentice–Journeyman–Master framework. Of course, the steps don't always follow in an orderly sequence, and the stages often overlap. But they provide a sense of the terrain.

01 Apprentice

When you start out, your role is to learn. You're in someone else's world, learning to do things their way, and they take responsibility for what you do. I've called this step Doing time . Your focus is on yourself – on the knowledge and skills you are acquiring. You are shielded from the impact of the mistakes you will inevitably make, both on the work itself and on you as a person. You become part of a community of practice, a group of people already doing what you aspire to learn. This community is usually supportive, though you may not experience it like that at the time. You are not expected, or even permitted, to depart from the established ways or try new things out. Your job is to conform, not to innovate. Your work involves repetition, boredom, trudging through menial tasks, and having to do things even when you don't understand why.

The next step – Using your senses – is about the fruits of doing time: the understanding you gradually develop of the work you are learning to do. You become familiar with the world you are starting to inhabit. You learn how it functions. You experience your work with your senses and your mind, as well as with your hands and your body. This applies whether you are becoming a stonemason or a doctor, attending evening classes in hat-making, learning the oboe as an adult beginner, or studying to become a lawyer, a film-maker, an accountant or anything else.

The third step, Space and other people , is about being systematic with the materials and tools you work with – ‘mise en place', as the chefs call it. At the same time, you develop sensitivity to the people you are working with: your colleagues or patients, customers or clients. You learn how to enter and work within other people's personal space.

By now you are getting ready to leave the Apprentice phase. Along with this comes Getting it wrong and putting it right . Mistakes happen, but so far you've been cushioned by being a novice. People expect you to get things wrong. Your environment is arranged so that you, your colleagues and your workplace are protected from the consequences of your errors. You start by working on material that doesn't matter, that can be replaced. You have people who will tell you when you're going off course and how to put things right. You're in a safe space. But in the next phase, that starts to change.

02 Journeyman

Now you're becoming independent – responsible for your work and how it's received. This transition from Apprentice to Journeyman entails two pivotal shifts. The first I've called ‘ It's not about you ', borrowing a phrase from magicians I've worked with. This requires a radical change in your focus of attention, shifting it away from yourself. Expert work involves doing something for someone else. Somewhere, there's an audience – a person or people who experience what you do – though you don't always see them directly. That audience may be obvious, as at a concert, a football match or a play. Here, expert and audience share space and time, and the work is synchronous. But in other fields, the audience is not there with you, and your work is asynchronous. When a potter makes a vase in a studio, there may be nobody else watching. But still the potter intends their work to be seen, whether in a shop, an exhibition or a display. Although the making takes place out of view, there is always an audience, even if theoretical, distant or completely unknown.

Whether you're an artist, a scientist, a clinician or a mechanic, this stage involves moving attention away from yourself. It's the shift ‘from you to them'. ‘Them' refers to the people who experience your work – your audience, patients or customers. This is a crucial transition, though it doesn't always happen at the same point on the path to becoming expert. Sometimes it doesn't happen at all. It's possible to be technically brilliant but remain focused on yourself; to miss or corrupt the heart of what you are doing. In my profession, the occasional rogue surgeons who carry out unnecessary operations, or experiment without their patients' consent, are often highly skilled. But they distort their work's purpose, coming to think it is more about them than their patients.

The second shift is Developing voice . I've taken this term from the world of jazz, where musicians will create a personalized musical fingerprint. As a performer, you reach a point where you are no longer a cog in someone else's machine, but a creator of expert work in your own right. As you establish your style, you develop your individuality. Now, you are shaping your work and giving it your signature. You are taking responsibility for being yourself and establishing your own identity. That requires confidence and self-belief. It's a subtle process, as it needs to develop in parallel with the transition to ‘it's not about you' without making you arrogant or self-centred. You need to balance your emerging identity as an expert with a constant awareness of who your work is for. When this succeeds, you establish yourself as an individual, recognizable to those who experience your work.

Alongside these two shifts runs Learning to impro vise . By now, you are taking responsibility for the successes and failures of your work, and you're responding to what life throws at you. You may be leading a surgical team, as I was. You may be developing your own research as a scientist, or setting up in business. You may be performing in public, writing a novel or heading up your department. Whatever your field, you'll be faced with the unexpected, and you'll have to improvise. When things go wrong, it's up to you to fix them. At the same time, as a Journeyman, you have freedom. You can develop new ideas, challenge existing methods, put your own stamp on the things you make or do. As we'll see, some of the most creative leaps come from serendipitous insights that nobody anticipated or planned. Improvisation is a hallmark of becoming expert.

03 Master

By this time you have become expert in the field you've spent so long studying. A few people go further, reimagining their field and taking it to a different place. In Changing direction , I examine what it means to reshape your field and take it in a new direction. Many of the experts in this book have done exactly that. One of these was John Wickham, a pivotal figure in the development of keyhole surgery.

In the final step, Passing it on , you are sharing your expertise with others and helping them grow. This requires another switch ‘from you to them', but this time ‘them' refers to people in your field: students, apprentices, and colleagues in your group or community of practice. Passing it on forces you to think about your own thinking. It makes you clarify what you do, distilling years of expertise into something you can share with others. Not all experts do this formally, establishing their own teaching practice or workshop. Not all experts do this at all.

This is when you take responsibility for supporting other people as they learn and for the errors they will inevitably make. You take the rap if things go wrong. You may ‘pass it on' in other ways too. You might write a book or a blog, or share your work through television, radio or the internet. Whatever the format, passing it on is a marker of having become expert, a recognition that you have something worth sharing.

Being a Master is more than just conveying what you know. It is a relationship of care. You are as much a mentor and a coach as a teacher. You are taking responsibility for people who come along behind you, and you're contributing to your field. Often you develop a sense of stewardship, a concern for the sustainability of the work you believe in so strongly. Many experts join boards or teaching faculties, supporting groups of learners as well as individuals. The work of becoming expert is never over, but the Master always runs out of time.

This path to becoming expert makes things sound simpler than they are. Often, experts don't recognize or acknowledge that they have become expert, especially as there is no final point of completion. It's difficult to know when you've arrived. Or you may be expert in some areas but not in others.

Experts themselves are often the last people to recognize that they are expert at all. They might feel an imposter, constantly wondering when they're going to be found out. They are astonished that others want to come and learn from them. They may not feel they have achieved ‘Master' status. But that doesn't mean they aren't expert. It just means that becoming an expert is different from having expertise. Often it takes someone else to recognize the distinction.

The journey from novice to expert is not linear. The stages are seldom as clear-cut as I've made them seem. The journey stops and starts and stutters. Often it feels like one step forward and two steps back. Becoming expert is about identity, about becoming a taxidermist, a tailor or a computer programmer; not just being able to do the things those people do.

This is a subtle but important distinction. It involves an ontological shift, a change in who you are as well as what you can do. This identity formation takes a long time and can be scary. Experiences along the way have profound effects: a serious error can forge a new resilience – or knock you back; extra responsibility can open up new horizons – or bring paralysing insecurity. All this builds into a cumulative experience that shapes what you become.

This book describes a path that runs from knowing nothing to passing on the wisdom of a lifetime. If you know it will take years to get there, you'll be less likely to give up after a few months if things aren't going well. There will be bumpy bits – long periods of boredom or frustration; bleak times when you don't seem to make any progress; points when you're tempted just to throw the whole thing over – and a map may help. Though a map won't keep you dry when it's raining, at least you're not lost.

You don't become an expert overnight. It takes a long time and a lot of effort. Without those, it won't happen. But how much time and how much effort? That's impossible to say, as it depends so much on each person. In the chapters that follow I will pull together the stories of people who have become experts, and try to make sense of their collective experience. Some of these stories are about the skills these experts had to develop, the way they learned to look and to do. Even more important are the shifts they made in their thinking and the self-awareness they gained along the way.

Being expert is hard to pin down. There's no clear moment when you ‘get there'. You're in a perpetual state of becoming, zooming ahead in some areas and lagging behind in others. That's one of the things that characterizes true experts. They're always dissatisfied with where they've got to, always aware they could do things better.

Experts know that they can never stay still. It's like being in a boat, rowing slowly against the current. If you're not moving forward, you start to drift back. You can be proud of the work you've done, but you can never say that you have become as good as you will ever be. You have to keep moving, putting in energy, or you stagnate.

学徒：积累、运用感官、空间与他人

熟练工：「重点不在于你」、找到自己的声音

大师：传承技艺

本书的核心就是这个「学艺模型」（apprenticeship model）。几个世纪以来，这个理论在欧洲广泛流传，在世界各地也有类似的理论。许多人认为该模型与中世纪工匠学艺的行会系统有关。尽管英国的许多学徒制度正在被社会、政治与工业化变革所淘汰，但该模型依然有助于我们的思考。在历史上，「学艺」是指学习一门手艺或行当，但对我而言，这个词也适用于各种专家 —— 从动物标本剥制师到教师，从水管工到飞行员。即使大多数人没有仔细思考过这个模型，也能凭直觉理解。最重要的是，该模型形象地表明了进步的理念。我会以这个模型作为本书的框架。

从传统上讲，学艺过程包含了三个阶段 —— 学徒、熟练工与大师。当然，现在的社会条件与中世纪的欧洲截然不同。学徒不再睡在师父的家里，也不再需要无偿工作多年，但是这种阶段划分为想要成为专家的人提供了指引。

1、学徒：你在开始学习时一无所知。你观察、模仿别人，学着去做师父工坊里的那些事情。你的师父要为你的工作和你犯的错误负责，而你工作取得的任何成绩也属于师父。

2、熟练工：你以独立专家的身份开始职业生涯。你离开了师父的工坊，周游全国。现在你要为自己的工作负责，必须面对犯错的后果。你会不断获得经验，磨炼并精进你的技能，发展你的个性。

3、大师：最后你建立了自己的工坊，开始教授他人。你把自己的知识和专长传递给了下一代。你尽可能地照顾那些向你学习的人；你对自己的专业领域有着更广泛的责任意识；有时你甚至会引领这个领域的新方向。

这三个阶段是理解技能学习的有效方法，但它们是描述性的，而不是解释性的。这些阶段阐明了过程中的节点，但不会告诉你如何到达这些节点，或怎样才能知道自己何时到达。这些阶段将学艺过程分成了不同的部分，并将这些部分视为静态的。它们衡量了可以衡量的东西，但许多重要的东西是无法衡量的。有些改变体现在「你是谁」上，而不仅体现在「你能做什么」上。这个过程可能从外表上是看不出来的。它很难量化，甚至难以觉察。

许多研究关注的是「专长」，将其限定在客观的属性与能力方面。在这些研究看来，专长与获得专长的人是分开的。所谓专长，就是能够制作燕尾榫的木工手艺，或者把球投入篮筐的球技。但我更感兴趣的是人的内部发生了什么，成为专家的过程意味着什么，成为一位被同行、公众和外界认可的专家又意味着什么。我感兴趣的不是一个人如何制作燕尾榫，而是学习制作燕尾榫的时候发生了什么。

描述性的结论很少能提供行之有效的诀窍。如果你想成为专家，它们不会告诉你应该做什么准备，或者应该朝哪个方向努力。它们也不会告诉你可能需要多长时间，或者在途中会遇到什么问题。所以我把「学徒－熟练工－大师」的模型分解成了更小的步骤，也就是成为专家的诀窍。这些步骤构成了本书的章节。在前文的图中，我描绘了这些步骤与「学徒－熟练工－大师」框架的对应关系。当然，这些步骤并不总是按顺序进行的，不同阶段之间常有重叠，但它们阐明了大致的方向。

学徒

在最开始，你要做的是学习。你进入了别人的世界，学习按照他们的方式做事，而他们会为你的行为负责。我把这一步称为「积累」。你关注的是自己 —— 你正在学习的知识和技能。你不可避免地会犯错，但你受到了保护，免受这些错误对于工作本身和你个人的影响。你成了这个实践社群的一员，这群人已经在做着你渴望学习的事情。这个社群通常会很支持你，不过你可能当时不会感觉到这一点。旁人不会期待，甚至不会允许你偏离既定的做事方式，尝试新鲜事物。你的任务是顺应传统，而不是创新。你的工作是重复、无聊、费力地完成微不足道的任务，甚至在你不理解的情况下也不得不做一些事情。

下一步是「运用感官」。这与「积累」的成果有关：你对自己学习的事情逐渐产生了理解。你开始熟悉这个你正在融入的世界了。你了解了它的运作方式。你会用自己的感官和思维、双手和身体，来感受自己所做的工作。无论你要成为一名石匠还是医生，无论你是在夜校学习制作帽子、成年后才初学双簧管，还是正在学习成为一名律师、电影制作人、会计或其他职业者，都会经历这一阶段。

最后一步是「空间与他人」，这与系统性地处理工作对象、使用工具有关。这就好比厨师所说的「准备工作」（miseen place）。在这个过程中，你会对工作中的人（你的同事、患者、顾客或客户）产生一种敏锐的感知。你会学习如何进入他人的个人空间，并在其中工作。

现在你已经准备好离开学徒阶段了。随之而来的是犯错和纠正。你有时会犯错，但到目前为止，你还是一个新手，会得到一些保护。你犯错误，是大家预料之中的事。你周围的环境已得到了妥善的安排。这样你、你的同事和工作场所就受到了保护，免受你错误的影响。你会从那些无关紧要、可以被替代的事情做起。有人会告诉你何时偏离了正轨，以及如何纠正错误。你处在一个安全的空间里。但是在下一阶段，这种情况就开始发生改变了。

熟练工

现在，你已经独立了 —— 为自己的工作及其影响负责。从学徒到熟练工的转变包括两个关键的变化。我将第一个变化称为「重点不在于你」，这句话是从与我合作过的魔术师那里借用来的。这种转变需要你彻底改变关注的焦点，把注意力从自己身上移开。专业工作是为别人做事。在某个地方，有一名受众 —— 你所做的事情会影响这个人，不过你并非总能直接看见他。受众可能近在咫尺，比如音乐会、足球赛或戏剧的观众。在这种情况下，专家与受众同处一个空间与时间，工作的完成与接受是同步的。但是在其他领域，受众并不总是与你在一起，工作的完成与接受是不同步的。陶艺师在工作室里制作花瓶时，可能没有人在一旁观看，但他们仍然希望自己的作品被人看到，无论是在商店、展览还是展示会上。虽然制作花瓶的过程不被人看见，但总是有受众的，即使这些受众仅存在于理论上、远方或者完全未知的地方。

无论你是艺术家、科学家、医生还是机械师，这一阶段都要求你把注意力从自己身上移开。这就是「从你到他们」的转变。「他们」是指接受你工作的人 —— 你的观众、患者或顾客。这是一种至关重要的转变，不过在你成为专家的过程中，这种转变并不会发生在固定的时间点上。有时根本不会发生。可能你在技术上很出色，但依然关注自己，罔顾或破坏了你工作的核心。在我的职业生涯中，偶尔会遇到不守规矩的外科医生做一些不必要的手术，或者未经患者同意就进行实验，他们的技术往往很高超，但他们歪曲了工作的目的。他们认为工作主要是为了自己，而不是患者。

第二个变化是「找到自己的声音」。这句话是我从爵士乐领域里学来的。爵士音乐家会创造个性化的标志。作为一个表演者，到了某种程度，你就不再是他人机器里的一颗齿轮了，而是凭借自己的本事，成为专业工作中的一个创造者。当你形成自己的风格时，你就发展了自己的个性。现在，你真正塑造着自己的工作方式，并为之赋予你的特色。你要为做自己、建立自己的身份认同承担责任。这需要信心和自我信念。

这是一个微妙的过程，因为这个过程需要与「重点不在于你」的转变同时发生，这样就不会让你变得傲慢或以自我为中心。

你不仅要找到作为专家的新身份，还要时刻意识到自己工作是为了谁，在这两种之间找到平衡。当你成功做到这一点时，在那些接受你工作的人眼中，你就成了一个独立的、鲜明的形象。

在这两种转变的同时，你还要学会随机应变。此时，你要为工作的成败负责，要处理你所面临的境况。你可能会像我过去那样，领导一个外科团队。你可能是一个在自己领域里耕耘的科学家，或者是创业的商人。你可能会写小说、在公众面前表演，或者领导自己的部门。无论你在什么行业，你都会面临意想不到的事情，而你将不得不随机应变。当事情出错的时候，需要你来处理它们。与此同时，作为一名熟练工，你拥有一些自由。你可以发展新的理念，挑战现有的方法，在你所做的事情上留下自己的印记。我们将会看到，有些最有创意的飞跃源于偶然的灵感，没有人能意料到或预先做出计划。随机应变是成为专家的标志。

大师

此时，你已经在自己耕耘已久的领域里成了专家。有些人走得更远，重塑了自己的领域，引领它进入了不同的境界。在第 10 章「改变方向」里，我会探讨重塑自己的领域，将其带入新方向意味着什么。本书中的许多专家正是做了这样的事情。其中一人就是约翰·威克姆（John Wickham），他是推动锁孔手术发展的关键人物。

在最后一步 ——「传承技艺」中，你会与别人分享自己的专长，帮助他们成长。这需要你在关注点上再次做出「从你到他们」的转变，但这一次，「他们」指的是你领域内的人：学生、学徒以及你所在的实践团体或社群里的同事。「传承技艺」会迫使你思考自己的思维方式 —— 弄清自己所做的事情，把自己积累多年的专长提炼成可以分享的东西。并非所有的专家都会专门这样做，比如开班授课或举办研讨会。有些专家根本不会做这些事。

他人在学习的时候，必然会犯错。就在这个时候，你要承担起支持他们的责任。如果出了差错，你就得承担责任。你也可以通过其他方式「传承技艺」。你可以写书，或者通过电视、广播或互联网分享自己的工作。无论以哪种形式，「传承技艺」是成为专家的标志，是对你拥有值得分享的东西的认可。

成为「大师」不仅需要你把自己所知的东西传承下去。这是一种关心他人的关系。你不仅是一名教师，也是导师和教练。你要为跟随你的人负责，要为自己的领域做贡献。你通常会产生一种责任意识，关心你所坚信的事业的持续发展。许多专家会加入一些委员会、成为教师，支持学习者和学习团体。成为专家的过程永远不会结束，但大师的时间总是有限的。

这条成为专家的道路，会让事情听起来比实际上简单。专家往往不知道或不承认他们已经成了专家，尤其是因为这条道路没有终点。你很难知道自己何时成为专家。你可能在某些领域是专家，但在另一些领域则不是。

专家往往是最后一个认识到自己是专家的人。他们可能会觉得自己名不副实，不断地担心自己的真面目什么时候会被揭穿。其他人想要来向他们学习会让他们感到很惊讶。他们可能不会觉得自己已经取得了「大师」的地位，但这不意味着他们不是专家。这只是意味着成为专家与拥有专长是不同的。通常只有其他人才能看清这两种之间的区别。

从新手到专家的过程不是一条平坦的直线。这些阶段的划分也很少像我说的那样清晰。这趟旅程是走走停停、断断续续的，经常让人觉得好像前进了一步，又后退了两步。成为专家在于身份认同，在于成为一名标本剥制师、裁缝或电脑程序员，而不仅仅是能够做那些人做的事情。

这是一个微妙而重要的区别，涉及一种本体的转变 —— 一种「你是谁」以及「你能做什么」的转变。这种身份认同的形成需要很长时间，而且可能很可怕。一路走来的经历有着深远的影响；一个严重的错误可能造就新的抗逆力，也可能让你一蹶不振；额外的责任可能打开新的视野，也可能带来让人无能为力的不安全感。所有这一切汇集成经验，塑造了你所成为的人。

本书描绘了一条道路：从一无所知到传承一生的智慧。如果你知道这条路需要多年才能走完，那么当事情进展不顺时，你就不太可能在几个月后就放弃了。路上会有坎坷 —— 漫长的无聊与沮丧，似乎毫无进展的暗淡时光，有时还想把一切抛到一边。这幅地图也许能帮你。虽然这幅地图不能在下雨时让你保持干爽，但你至少不会迷路。

你不会在一夜之间成为专家。这需要花费很长时间，付出很多努力。若非如此，这一切就不会发生。但是，到底需要多长时间、多大努力？很难说，因为这在很大程度上取决于每个人的特点。在接下来的章节里，我会讲述那些已经成为专家的人的故事，并试图从中总结他们共同的经验。其中一些故事，与这些专家必须发展的技能有关，与他们学到的观察和做事方式有关。更重要的是他们在一路上产生和获得的思维方式，以及自我意识的转变。

成为专家的过程是很难明确界定的。没有明确的「到达终点」的时刻。你永远处在「成为」的状态中。你可能在某些领域高歌猛进，而在另一些领域则不尽如人意。这是真正专家的特点。他们总是对自己的现状不满，总是意识到自己能做得更好。专家知道他们不会永远原地踏步。这就像逆水行舟，不进则退。你可以为自己的工作感到自豪，但你永远不能说你已经达到了巅峰。你必须继续前进，付出精力，否则就会停滞不前。

### 1.5 本书的结构

How this book is structured

This book is not about how to do the things experts do. That may be fascinating, but it's not my aim; I don't want to become a taxidermist, and I doubt you do either. Nor is it about expertise in abstract academic terms, though it does draw on what others have written.

Instead I lay down a challenge to move beyond the discipline-based thinking that keeps plumbers, neuroscientists, potters, magicians and heart surgeons in separate compartments. I highlight similarities and differences between experts, and I map a path from raw novice to wise mentor.

This book is about real people.

One of the strands running through the chapters that follow is my insider's perspective. That gives me access to things other people can't or won't say. I've drawn on my own experiences: the mistakes I've made, the thoughts I've had, and the ideas I've developed over the years. In my case, many of these are medical. That's inevitable, because I'm a doctor. My emphasis on clinical experiences is not because the world of medicine is unusually expert, but because that happens to be my story. If you were writing it, the central thread would be different. In that case you'd be drawing on other examples, making other connections. But the stages and themes would be similar.

In my professional career, I've changed direction several times and I'm still doing that now. I've been a surgeon, a family doctor, an academic and a university teacher, and in those areas I've become proficient. I have other interests too. As an amateur musician I'm still at the shallow end – nowhere near being an expert. And as a harpsichord-maker and a light-aircraft pilot I've had an initial taste, but never progressed beyond being a beginner. All of us do different things with our lives, and we're always at different staging posts along the path towards becoming expert. I've simply drawn on the parallels that are closest to hand for me, so I can draw comparisons.

At various points in the story, however, I'll bring in other strands and other experts. One of these is Joshua Byrne, a bespoke tailor I've been working with for over a decade. At first glance, Joshua's world and mine could hardly be further apart. After all, medicine is a science and tailoring is a craft – or so it seems. Yet our experiences have been surprisingly similar. We've been through the same stages, struggled with similar challenges. By comparing our experiences, our difficulties, and our ways of looking at the world, I will trace the shape of the path from Apprentice to Master.

I'll also bring in more people at the top of their game. I've already introduced Derek the taxidermist. Over the years I've had the privilege of meeting many others. Some are colleagues in medicine and science. Some are experts in the visual and performing arts. And there are pilots, magicians and craftspeople, too. I've watched them in their studios, workshops and laboratories, and I've spent hours talking to them. Those insights form the backbone of my research.

Though my own career has been medical, I'm not practising as a doctor now. If I'm expert in anything, it's education. When I work with students and trainee surgeons I see them struggling with the steps I've outlined. I see them coping with boring repetitive work, developing skill in their hands and bodies, dealing with error, working with people, and going on to teach. I've also read what others have written about expertise, and tried to understand their theories and their ideas.

As you read this book another strand will emerge – your own. Everyone has their own experience of becoming expert, to a greater or lesser degree. Whether you're dedicating your life to a single focused aim or simply trying to get better at something you enjoy, the urge to become expert lies in each of us. It is difficult but not impossible. It's like running a marathon: anyone can do it if they train for long enough and persevere. Few of us will become world champions, but we can all try.

本书讲的不是如何做那些专家做的事情。那个话题可能很有意思，但不是我的目标；我不想成为一名标本剥制师，我猜那也不是你的目标。本书讲的也不是作为抽象术语的「专长」，但我确实借鉴了许多他人的著作。

相反，我提出了一项挑战，要超越那种把水管工、神经科学家、陶艺师、魔术师和心外科医生划分为不同领域的、以学科为基础的思维方式。我强调了专家之间的相似点和不同点，并描绘了一条从稚嫩新手到明智导师的道路。

这本书讲的是真正的人。

接下来的章节中有一条主线，也就是我个人的视角。这样我就能讨论他人不能或不愿说的事情。我总结了亲身经历：我犯的错误、我的想法，以及我多年来形成的观念。在我的例子里，很多这些东西都与医学有关。这是不可避免的，因为我是医生。我强调临床工作的经历，并不是因为医学领域的专业性异乎寻常，而是因为这恰好是我的故事。如果你来写这本书，主线可能就大不相同了。在这种情况下，你就会借鉴其他的例子，阐述其他的相关论据。但是，这些阶段和主题是相似的。

在我的职业生涯里，我改变过几次方向，我现在依然在这样做。我做过外科医生、家庭医生、学者和大学教师，我在这些领域都很得心应手。我也有其他兴趣。作为一名业余的音乐家，我的水平还很一般 —— 比专家差远了。我对制作羽管键琴和开轻型飞机感兴趣，但从没有超越初学者的水平。我们每个人在生活中都做着不同的事情，在成为专家的路上，我们总是处在不同的阶段。我只是描绘了最贴近我生活的路线，以便进行比较。

不过，在故事的不同时刻，我会引入其他线索、其他专家的例子。约书亚·伯恩（Joshua Byrne）就是其中之一，他是一位与我合作了十余年的定制裁缝。乍一看，约书亚和我的世界相去甚远。毕竟，医学是一门科学，而裁缝是一门手艺 —— 或者看上去如此。然而，我们的经历却惊人地相似。我们经历了相同的阶段，面临过相似的挑战。通过比较我们的经历、困境，以及我们看待世界的方式，我会描绘出从学徒到大师的道路。

我也会介绍更多在各自领域内拔尖的人。我已经介绍了标本剥制师德里克。这些年来，我还有幸认识了许多这样的人。有些人是医学和科学领域的同事，有些人是视觉与表演艺术方面的专家，还有飞行员、魔术师、工匠。我在他们的工作室、工坊和实验室里观察过他们，并与他们交谈了好多个小时。这些见解构成了我研究的支柱。

虽然我从事的是医学，但我现在并非执业医生。如果说我是什么方面的专家，那就是教育。在与学生和实习外科医生一起工作时，我发现他们会在我说的那些步骤上遇到困难。我看到他们要处理无聊的重复性工作、发展双手与身体上的技能、纠正错误、与他人一起工作，然后继续走上教学岗位。我也读过其他人写的关于「专长」的文献，试图理解他们的理论和理念。

在你阅读本书的时候，另一条主线会浮现出来 —— 你的主线。每个人或多或少都有成为专家的经历。无论你是一生都投身于一个目标，还是只想在自己喜欢的事情上做得更好，成为专家的渴望存在于我们每个人的身上。成为专家很难，但并非不可能。这就像跑马拉松一样：只要训练时间够长，持之以恒，每个人都能做到。我们中很少有人能成为世界冠军，但我们都可以尝试。

### 1.6 专家面临的威胁

Experts under threat

So why is becoming expert important? In the book's final chapter I'll try to explain. For centuries, the apprenticeship system expected people to go through the lengthy process that leads in the end to mastery. Though becoming expert brings rewards, these rewards don't come instantly. There are no shortcuts, and immediate gratification is not on offer. This is increasingly at odds with our social world and its intolerance of doing things slowly. People are impatient, and they want to see results. They don't want to spend years in someone else's workshop before becoming independent.

In some ways, the work of individual experts is highly prized, especially in a world of uniformity and mass production. At the same time, experts as a group are being devalued and their skills dismissed. This is partly because the end result – a suit, a vase, a successful operation – conceals the work that has gone into it. The greater the expertise, the less you notice it. So it's often easy to imagine that you or anyone else could do the same.

But there's also a devaluing of expertise in society. Experts are seen as elite, unnecessary and dispensable, because information that was once their exclusive province can now be accessed at the click of a mouse. But this is a dangerous misconception. Information is not wisdom. And wisdom is what experts provide.

We have always needed experts, and I believe we always will. Partly that's because of what they can do for us: the services they provide, and the objects and experiences they create. But just as importantly, they give us inspiration. They show us what we can do if we really want to. At the end of this book I'll return to why experts are essential to us all and address questions I often hear, such as: Why should we seek to become expert in some areas of our life? Why are experts under threat? And what can we do about it?

I started this book with Derek the taxidermist posing his clouded leopard. But for now we'll leave Derek and go back several decades, to a hospital on the outskirts of Johannesburg in South Africa. I'm in the operating theatre with Simon, who has been disembowelled.

为什么成为专家很重要？我会在本书的最后一章尝试解释这个问题。几个世纪以来，学徒制要求人们经历漫长的过程，最终掌握一门技艺。虽然成为专家会带来回报，但回报不是立竿见影的。这个过程没有捷径，也没有即时的满足。这一点与我们的社会越来越格格不入，社会不再能容忍慢吞吞地做事了。

大家已经没有耐心了，他们想看到结果。他们不希望在独立工作之前，还得在别人的工坊里待上好多年。

在某些方面，专家个体的工作受到了高度重视，尤其是在这个步调一致、大规模生产的世界里。与此同时，专家群体正在贬值，他们的技能正在遭到遗弃。这在一定程度上是因为最终结果（一套西装、一个花瓶或一次成功的手术）隐藏了专家们为之付出的心血。其中蕴含的专业技能越多，你就越难以注意到。所以大家很容易以为自己或任何人都能做到同样的事情。

但是社会对于专长的评价也越来越低。专家被视为可有可无的精英，因为曾经专属于他们的信息，现在点点鼠标就唾手可得。然而这是一种危险的误解。信息不是智慧。智慧才是专家提供的东西。

我们一直都需要专家，我相信我们以后也是如此。这在一定程度上是因为他们能为我们做的事情：他们提供的服务，以及他们创造的事物和体验。但同样重要的是，他们鼓舞了我们。

他们告诉了我们，如果我们真心想做，就能够做到什么。在本书的最后，我会回到「为什么专家对我们所有人都很重要」的问题上，并回答我常常听到的问题，例如：我们为什么要成为生活某些领域的专家？为什么专家受到了威胁？我们能对此做些什么？

在本书开篇处，我写到了标本剥制师德里克给他的云豹标本摆的造型。但现在，我们要离开德里克，回到几十年前，去南非约翰内斯堡郊外的一所医院。我现在来到了西蒙的手术室里，他正在被开膛破肚。

[1] 为了保密，我修改了书中所有患者和临床同事的名字和其他细节。

## 0201. 外科医生与裁缝

0201 The surgeon and the tailor

It's 1981. I'm in Emergency Theatre B at Baragwanath Hospital and I'm about to start a trauma case. Baragwanath is in Soweto in South Africa – at that time one of the most violent places in the world. It's 4 a.m. on a Saturday night and Simon, a young Zulu man in his early twenties, has been stabbed. He's on a stretcher when I first meet him, coils of intestine spilling out of a wound in his abdomen onto the sheet that covers him. Night after night, patients like Simon are rushed into the ‘surgical pit' for emergency treatment.

I've only been at Baragwanath for a short time, but already I'm used to seeing patients with their guts hanging out – evisceration, as the textbooks call it. I've learned that the dramatic-looking ones aren't always the most dangerous. But Simon fn1 is really sick. He's not responding, he's slipping into unconsciousness and his blood pressure is dropping. He must be bleeding internally, and he needs immediate surgery.

We've rushed him to theatre. It's a busy intake, with several surgeons on duty. They are all in other theatres, dealing with their own cases. I'm in my twenties, eager to operate but still wet behind the ears. I've been a surgical registrar at Baragwanath for a year or so, and I've reached the stage where I should be able to do an operation like this on my own.

With elective (planned) surgery, you can start with ‘easy' cases and build up. But with trauma surgery, you never know what you're going to find. Blades and bullets don't respect anatomy, and what starts off as a straightforward case can quickly turn into a nightmare. As I scrub up, I go through in my mind what I might encounter. I'm excited and terrified at the same time.

As soon as Simon is anaesthetized, I clean his skin, cover him with sterile drapes, then make an incision in his abdominal wall. I deepen it until I'm into the peritoneal cavity. Dark blood wells up and I can't see a thing. Lumps of maize floating on the blood and a sudden sour whiff of beer show there's contamination – the stab wound has gone into the stomach, at least. But my first priority is to stop the bleeding.

There's so much blood that at first I can't find where it's coming from. The temptation is to grab the first bleeding point I can see, but I force myself to slow down and be systematic, examining each of the organs in turn before deciding what to deal with first. Liver, stomach, small bowel, large bowel, spleen, pelvic organs. One by one I check them, sometimes by eye, sometimes reaching around corners to feel the parts I can't see.

I realize with a lurch that the stab wound is deeper than I thought. It's gone down towards the head of the pancreas – tiger country for any surgeon, but especially one as inexperienced as I am. Blood keeps obliterating my field of view and I feel a rising panic. What if I can't cope, and my patient bleeds out on the table?

1981 年，我在巴拉瓜纳医院的 B 紧急手术室，准备开始为一个外伤患者做手术。巴拉瓜纳医院位于南非的索韦托 —— 当时这里是世界上暴力最为泛滥的地区之一。周六凌晨四点，20 岁出头的祖鲁族青年西蒙被刺伤了。我刚见到他时，他正躺在转运床上，一节肠子从他腹部的伤口中流了出来，摊在他身上的床单上。夜复一夜，常有像西蒙这样的患者被推进手术室（我们称之为「手术坑」）进行紧急治疗。

我来巴拉瓜纳医院的时间不长，但我已经习惯了看到患者的肠子挂在外面 —— 就像教科书里讲的除脏术一样。我知道那些看起来很夸张的病例并不是最危险的，但西蒙的病情很危急。他没有任何反应，正逐渐失去意识，血压也在下降。他肯定是内出血了，需要马上动手术。

我们急忙把他送去手术室。我们接诊的人手不足，只有几名外科医生值班。他们都在其他手术室里，处理他们自己的患者。我只有 20 多岁，渴望亲手动手术，但还很稚嫩。我在巴拉瓜纳医院做了一年左右的外科住院医师，现在我已经可以独立做这样的手术了。

在有选择（计划）的情况下，你可以从「简单」的手术做起，逐步积累经验。但对于外伤手术患者，你永远无法知道自己会面对什么。尖刀和子弹不理会解剖学上的难易，一开始看起来简单的病例，可能很快就会变得像噩梦一样棘手。我把手洗干净，在脑子里想象着可能会遇到的情况。我既兴奋又害怕。

西蒙一进入麻醉状态，我就给他的皮肤消了毒，盖上无菌洞巾，然后在他的腹壁上切开一个口子。我继续往里切，直到切开腹膜腔。暗红的血涌了出来，我什么也看不见。一块块玉米残渣漂浮在血液里，突然出现的酸啤酒味表明腹腔受到了污染 —— 至少伤到了胃。但是我的首要任务是止血。

血太多了，一开始我都不知道血是从哪儿来的。此时我很容易只顾自己能看到的第一个出血点，但我强迫自己放慢速度、着眼全局，依次检查每个器官，然后决定先做什么。肝脏、胃、小肠、大肠、脾、盆腔器官。我一个接一个地检查，有时用眼睛看，有时用手摸索，去感觉我看不到的部分。

我猛然意识到刺伤比我想象的更深。伤口向下延伸到了胰腺的上部 —— 对任何外科医生来说都很棘手，对我这样经验不足的人来说就更难了。血液不断地阻碍我的视线，我感到越来越恐慌。万一我无力应付，患者在手术台上失血而死怎么办？ 

### 2.1 成为外科医生

Becoming a surgeon

That night in the operating theatre with Simon I was certainly no expert, though I'd done a fair amount of surgery under supervision. I had started to do things on my own, to take responsibility for the decisions I made, but I hadn't had much experience in leading major operations. In terms of the path I outlined in the previous chapter, I was well into the Apprentice phase, and starting to become a Journeyman.

Fast-forward almost four decades. My career since then has taken me in unexpected directions. I'm not a trauma surgeon now. I'm not even seeing patients. Instead I've become a professor at a large London university, and I've specialized in surgical education. I spend a lot of my time exploring what it is to become an expert, and now I'm writing this book. It's a long way from where I began, and now I'll explain how I got here.

When I was starting that operation on Simon in Soweto in 1981, I'd been studying medicine for over ten years and was well into my training as a surgeon. The first six of those years were at medical school. Then my career kicked off in earnest. First came a year as a newly qualified house officer. Next I went back to the university where I'd qualified, and spent a year teaching anatomy to medical students. That was because I'd decided I wanted to become a surgeon, and I needed to pass the Primary Fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons, a fearsome exam on anatomy, physiology and pathology. This was a stage on the way to gaining the Final Fellowship (FRCS for short), which was essential for becoming a consultant in the distant future. My anatomical knowledge as a medical student had been shaky to say the least, and I realized that the best way to learn was to teach.

After my time demonstrating anatomy, I'd been a junior doctor in orthopaedics, Accident and Emergency, and obstetrics. Then an opportunity came up to spend a year in South Africa. I leapt at the chance. Soon I found myself in alien and fascinating surroundings on the other side of the world. It proved so interesting that one year turned into two, then five. I completed my training as a specialist surgeon and became a consultant in South Africa.

For much of that time I worked at Baragwanath Hospital (now Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital), or ‘Bara' for short. Bara is in Soweto – South West Township, to give it its full name – on the outskirts of Johannesburg. At that time Soweto had a population of well over a million people. Bara was its only major hospital, and was one of the busiest in the world. This was towards the end of the apartheid era, and all the patients I looked after were black. They came from a bewildering array of cultures and spoke many languages. I'd never experienced anything like it.

Although we had patients with every kind of surgical condition, a lot of the time I was treating young men who had been stabbed or shot. Weekends were especially busy, as the migrant workers in Johannesburg would get drunk on payday and attack one another with pangas (machetes) or sometimes guns. It was gruelling, and I often worked for thirty-six hours at a stretch with no sleep. Of course, it wasn't all wounds caused by violence. Many of our older patients had horrible diseases like cancer of the oesophagus (gullet), which was especially prevalent in that part of Africa. We had our fair share of patients with perforated ulcers and strangulated hernias, conditions I was used to from the UK. I also encountered diseases I'd read about but never seen, like typhoid. A lot of the work was repetitive and routine. I spent hours in the ‘septic theatre', draining the abscesses that were so common in our patients. But it was the trauma surgery I felt most attuned to.

Bara at weekends looked like a war zone, something I would experience for real a few years later. In Bara, as soon as the patients arrived they would be sorted by a process of triage. The most seriously injured were usually unconscious. Often nobody knew the patient's name, and they were recorded as something like ‘Unknown Saturday Number x' until a friend or relative arrived to identify them. They would be put onto a trolley with a red ‘URGENT' sticker on their forehead, covered with a grey blanket and wheeled into the aptly named surgical pit, where doctors and nurses would stabilize them. The surgical team on call would make an assessment, do an initial resuscitation and take any patient with life-threatening injuries straight to theatre for surgery. Simon was one of those.

In the operating theatre, Simon is bleeding profusely. I'm starting to panic. Fortunately, Sister Ramaphosa, my scrub nurse, is highly experienced. Just as well, as my first assistant this evening is a newly qualified doctor who doesn't like surgery. He usually stays out of theatre, where he's not much use. But at least he can hold a retractor, helping me to get a clear view inside Simon's abdominal cavity.

At last, my systematic exploration pays off and I find a severed artery pumping in the small bowel mesentery, a delicate stalk that supplies the small intestine with blood. Before I have time to think, Sister Ramaphosa has put a pair of artery forceps in my hand. I clamp the vessel, wait a moment, then breathe more easily as things start to come under control. Nobody has said a word.

It gives me time to explore more thoroughly. These stab wounds are treacherous, as you've no idea how long the blade was or where it went. Sometimes a small blood clot is the only clue to serious damage deep inside; that's why I have to be systematic. I mobilize the colon; it looks a bit suspicious, so I need to check behind it. I snip the filmy layer which tethers it to Simon's posterior abdominal wall, gently separating the anatomical layers. When I approach the duodenum and pancreas, I'm really scared. Repairing an injury here would take me way beyond my comfort zone. I look carefully, exploring millimetre by millimetre. Although there's bruising, none of the vital structures have been seriously damaged. It's a huge relief.

The next hour is filled with cutting and stitching: removing a section of small intestine, sewing the ends together again, closing the wound in the stomach. All things I'd read about in textbooks and seen a hundred times before but seldom done on my own. After a final check, I'm satisfied that I've repaired all the damage. I close Simon's abdomen with sutures, put on a dressing and take off the green drapes, now soaked with blood. My gown, too, is soaked, and I have to go and change before I can start the next operation.

Opening someone's abdominal cavity to see what's wrong inside is called a laparotomy. I'd learned the steps from my textbooks. But books don't tell you what it feels like to operate, or how to cope when you realize you're getting out of your depth. The people who write the books have experienced that, but when you're starting out, you haven't. You don't yet share a language with them. Even the sensation of cutting into a living human body is hard to describe. The slitheriness of living flesh, the feel of organs pulsating under your fingers, the click of the instruments as they lock into place – not to mention the hammering of your heart as you start a major operation, or the sick feeling in your stomach when things start to go wrong. Nothing you read in books or see on television can prepare you for the real thing.

And none of those textbooks ever described the physical pleasure of operating when it goes well or the fear when things go wrong. None of them mentioned the satisfaction of seeing a seriously ill patient that you've operated on walking out of hospital once they've recovered. Looking back, I can still feel that mixture of excitement and apprehension when I opened Simon's abdomen. I didn't know what I'd find. I didn't know whether I could cope. But once I'd started, I forgot my anxiety. It wasn't about me any longer; it was about Simon. I had to work out what his injuries were and do my best to fix them. I narrowed my focus and concentrated on each part of the procedure, as I'd been taught. Luckily things turned out well, but afterwards I'd replay it in my head, wondering if I could have done things better.

After that operation I realized I'd reached a watershed. I wasn't an expert by any means – far from it. I was still in the Apprentice phase. But I had managed to subdue my anxiety and perform a difficult operation that ended well. For the first time, I felt I was becoming a surgeon , rather than just somebody who was able to do a surgical procedure.

Later I discovered that this happens to experts in many fields. Of course, when I was starting that operation I wasn't thinking of those other fields. I was a trainee surgeon, applying my scientific knowledge and physical skills to make an injured person better. It never occurred to me that I could learn from tailors, musicians, hairstylists or fighter pilots. Now, decades later, I wish I had.

和西蒙一起在手术室里的那天晚上，我当然不是什么专家，尽管我在督导之下做过不少手术。我已经开始独立做事，为自己的决定负责，但我没有太多主刀重大手术的经验。用我在前一章里概述的学艺之路来说，我早已进入了学徒阶段，开始成为一名熟练工。

来到大约 40 年后。与那时相比，我的职业生涯走向了意想不到的方向。我现在不是创伤外科医生了，甚至都不见患者。

相反，我成了伦敦一所大型高校的教授，专攻外科教育。我花了很多时间探索人如何成为专家，而现在我正在写作本书。这份工作与我的起点相去甚远，现在我会解释我是如何一路走到这里的。

在 1981 年的索韦托，当我开始为西蒙做手术时，我已经学医十余年了，接受了很长时间的外科医生训练。前六年的训练是在医学院进行的。然后我的职业生涯正式开始了。我取得医师资格后，先做了一年实习医生。然后我回到了我的母校，花了一年时间给医学生讲授解剖学。这是因为我决定做一名外科医生，需要通过皇家外科学院初级院士的考试，这是一系列令人生畏的解剖学、生理学和病理学考试。这是获得终极院士资格的必经之路，对于将来成为一名顾问医师至关重要。在求学时期，我的解剖学知识可以说不太扎实，我意识到学习的最好方式就是教学。

在教授解剖学以后，我又在骨科、事故与急诊科和产科担任过实习医生。然后，有一个在南非待上一年的机会出现了。

我抓住了这个机会。不久，我就来到了世界的另一头，置身于陌生而迷人的环境里。这次经历非常有趣，于是一年变成了两年、然后变成了五年。我完成了外科专科医生的培训，在南非成为一名顾问医师。

大部分时间我都在巴拉瓜纳医院（即现在的克里斯·哈尼·巴拉瓜纳医院，或简称「巴拉」医院）工作。巴拉瓜纳医院位于约翰内斯堡郊区的索韦托（Soweto）—— 其全称是西南镇（South West Township）。当时索韦托的人口有一百多万。巴拉瓜纳医院是当地唯一的一家大医院，也是世界上最繁忙的医院之一。当时正值种族隔离时代的末期，我看的所有患者都是黑人。他们来自五花八门的文化背景，说着许多不同的语言。我从来没有过这样的经历。

虽然我们给患者做过各式各样的手术，但很多时候我治疗的都是遭到刺伤或枪击的年轻男子。周末特别忙碌，因为约翰内斯堡的移民工人会在发薪日喝得酩酊大醉，用大砍刀（有时也会用枪）相互攻击。那种工作让人筋疲力尽，我经常连续工作 36 个小时不睡觉。当然，我们治疗的也不全是暴力造成的伤口。我们有许多老年患者患有可怕的疾病，比如食道癌。这种疾病在非洲的那个地区尤其普遍。我们有相当多的患者患有溃疡穿孔和绞窄疝，我在英国时就经常见到这些疾病。我也遇到过我读过但未见过的疾病，比如伤寒。许多工作都是重复和例行的。我也会一连好多个小时待在「脓肿治疗室」内，给患者身上常见的脓肿引流。但我最熟悉的还是创伤外科手术。

在周末，巴拉瓜纳医院看起来就像战场 —— 几年后我才会见识真正的战场。在巴拉瓜纳医院，患者一到就会按照分诊程序进行分类。伤势最严重的患者通常都失去了知觉。经常没有人知道患者的名字。直到朋友或亲属来确认他们的身份之前，

他们在病历上会被登记为「星期六第 × 号无名氏」。我们会把他们放在推车床上，在额头上贴上红色的「紧急」标签，盖上一条灰色的毯子，再推进名副其实的「手术坑」里，那里的医生和护士会让他们的状况稳定下来。待命的外科手术团队会进行评估，做初始复苏，并将危及生命的伤者直接送入手术室做手术。西蒙就是一名这样的患者。

在手术室里，西蒙流血不止。我开始感到恐慌。幸运的是，我的洗手护士拉马福萨经验非常丰富。我今晚的第一助手是一名刚取得医师资格的医生，他不喜欢手术。他通常不去手术室，因为他在那里帮不上什么忙。幸好他至少能拿稳牵开器，让我能清楚地看到西蒙的腹腔。

最后，我全面的检查取得了成效，我在小肠系膜里发现了一条被切断的动脉在搏动，这条纤细血管的作用是为小肠提供血液。我还没来得及思考，拉马福萨护士就将一把动脉钳放在我手里了。我夹住血管，过了一会儿，事情开始进入掌控之中，我的呼吸变得更轻松了。没有人说过一句话。

这样我就有时间更仔细地检查了。这种刺伤很棘手，因为你不知道刀有多长，也不知道刀是朝哪个方向刺的。有时一个小血块是体内严重损伤的唯一线索，这就是为什么我必须做全面检查。我动了动结肠，它看上去有点可疑，所以我要检查它的后方。我剪开把结肠固定在西蒙后腹腔壁上的薄膜，轻轻地将解剖层分开。当我的手靠近十二指肠和胰腺时，我感到非常害怕。修复这里的伤口远远不是我能从容做到的。我仔细地观第 2 章外科医生与裁缝 029 察，一厘米一厘米地摸索。虽然有些淤伤，但没有任何重要结构受到严重损害。我如释重负。

接下来是一个小时的切割与缝合：切除一段小肠，将两端重新缝上，缝合胃的伤口。这些事都是我在教科书中读过、看别人做过上百次的，但很少自己动手做。经过最后的检查，我很满意地看到我已经修复了所有的损伤。我用缝合线缝合了西蒙的腹部，包上敷料，取下沾满血迹的绿色洞巾。我的手术服也湿透了，我得先去换衣服才能开始下一场手术。

打开一个人的腹腔，观察内部状况的手术叫剖腹术。我在课本上学过这些步骤，但书本不会告诉你做手术是什么感觉，也不会告诉你当你意识到自己能力不够时该如何应对。写教材的人有那种经历，但当你开始学习时，你却没有。你和他们讲的还不是同一种语言。即便是切开一个活人身体的感觉也很难描述。鲜活肉体的滑腻感、器官在手指下搏动的感觉、器具锁定到正确位置时发出的咔嗒声 —— 更不用提你在做大手术时心脏的怦怦声，或者出错时胃里的恶心感。你在书中读到、在电视上看到的任何东西，都不能让你为真正的手术做好准备。

也没有任何一本教科书描述过手术顺利进行时的生理愉悦，或手术出问题时的恐惧。没有书籍提到过当你看见危重患者经过你的手术，康复出院时的满足感。现在回想起来，我仍然能感受到切开西蒙腹部时的那种既兴奋又恐惧的感觉。我不知道我会发现什么。我不知道我能否应付得来。可一旦我开始手术，我就忘记了焦虑。这件事不再是关于我的了，而是关于西蒙的。我必须弄清他的伤势，尽我所能来修补。就像老师教的那样，我精神高度集中，专注于手术的每一步。幸运的是，结果一切顺利，但我事后会反复回想，想知道我能否做得更好。

那次手术之后，我意识到自己来到了一个转折点。我那时根本不是专家 —— 还差得远。我还在学徒阶段。但是，我成功地克服了我的焦虑，做了一台困难的手术，结果很好。我第一次觉得自己成了一名外科医生，而不仅仅是一个会做外科手术的人。

后来，我发现许多领域的专家都会有这样的经历。当然，我在做手术的时候，并没有想到其他领域。我是个实习外科医生，用我的科学知识和身体技能帮助伤者康复。我从未想过我可以向裁缝、音乐家、发型设计师或战斗机飞行员学习。几十年后的今天，我希望我当时能意识到这一点。

### 2.2 成为全科医生

Becoming a general practitioner

In the years that followed, operating on patients like Simon became routine. Some of the most urgent had been stabbed in the heart. We usually had several of these over a weekend, sometimes more. In the end, I became used to running at full tilt down the corridor to the operating theatre with a patient whose heart was on the verge of stopping. A few moments to transfer the patient onto the table, then making a skin incision, splitting the breastbone with a hammer and chisel, slitting open the pericardial sac and putting a stitch in a spurting ventricle. Once things were under control we could all take a breather while the patient's blood pressure came up and ours went down, before we started closing the chest.

After almost three years at Bara, I felt I was getting the hang of trauma surgery. I wanted to broaden my experience, so I moved to Cape Town. I'd decided to continue my training at Groote Schuur, the university hospital famous for the world's first heart transplant, performed by Christiaan Barnard in 1967. At Groote Schuur I was still treating a lot of trauma patients, but I also worked for some of the world's leading experts in liver disease, intestinal surgery, neurosurgery, paediatric surgery and intensive care. By rotating through these specialities I gained a broad experience which later proved invaluable. I took my FRCS exams, became a consultant, and for a few months headed up the paediatric trauma unit at Cape Town's children's hospital. Nominally independent, I was making the transition from Apprentice to Journeyman.

By then I had been in South Africa for more than five years, but I'd never intended to stay there. My parents lived in London and my mother had become seriously ill with cancer. It was time to go home. Before returning, though, I spent several months as a consultant surgeon in Oshakati, a small town in a remote part of Namibia and home to the Owambo people. I discovered when I got there that Oshakati was on the border with Angola, and at that time South Africa and Angola were at war. Although I'd seen a lot of trauma, I'd never worked in an actual war zone and I hadn't realized how dangerous it would be. I found myself catapulted into a world that was like nothing I'd ever experienced. In every sense, it was a baptism of fire.

Above all, it was lonely. In Cape Town there was always someone to ask if I got really stuck. In Oshakati, I was on my own. The hospital was huge, and the surgical section alone had more than two hundred beds. But it was chronically short-staffed, and the surgeon in charge when I arrived had been working without a break for more than three years. He had a suitcase in his hand when I got there – he left the same day and I never saw him again. I found myself responsible for the two hundred surgical patients, with only two junior doctors to help me.

In Oshakati, I had to grow up fast. As well as the patients already on the wards, new ones with serious injuries poured in every day. Most of the time I was way outside my comfort zone. Along with day-to-day surgical problems, like draining abscesses and dealing with appendicitis, I had to look after people who had been blown up by roadside explosive devices or hit by rockets, often suffering appalling injuries. I had to learn to improvise, performing operations I'd heard of but never seen – let alone done.

Some of the most horrifying injuries were from phosphorus grenades. The phosphorus would burn its way into the patient's skin and was almost impossible to remove. One of the Owambo theatre sisters showed me what to do. You give the patient a general anaesthetic, put them on the operating table, then turn out all the lights. You see which parts of the patient glow in the dark, then cut them away with a scalpel or root them out with a wire brush. It was nightmarish. No one had ever mentioned phosphorus grenades when I was a houseman in North Wales.

This is what I mean by saying that the path to becoming expert isn't linear. In Oshakati, I was developing my voice as a Journeyman surgeon, but the demands of the work greatly outstripped my knowledge and confidence. I was taking responsibility for my decisions, and sometimes I got things wrong. Then my patients and I had to cope with the consequences.

When the time came for me to return to England I'd reached another watershed in my career. As a surgeon in Africa I'd spent a lot of time operating, then looking after my patients as they started to recover. But once they had been discharged from hospital, I never saw them again. I realized that, for me, there was something missing. I wanted to follow the stories of my patients over years, rather than days or weeks. And I wanted to experience other kinds of medicine.

One day while I was still in Cape Town, I had been leafing through the back pages of an out-of-date issue of the British Medical Journal . I spotted an advertisement for a one-year general practitioner (GP) trainee post in Lichfield, near Birmingham, in the English Midlands. The closing date had long passed, but I posted off an application anyway. A few weeks later, to my astonishment, they wrote back and offered me the position. So I ended up changing direction and retrained as a GP – a family doctor. It was a big step to take and my friends all thought I was mad. I knew it was a risk, but I thought it would be fascinating. And it was.

Changing from surgery to general practice was tough. I had to do a second apprenticeship. I learned a huge amount in my year as a GP trainee, though most of it wasn't new facts or techniques so much as new ways of putting my knowledge together. I wasn't quite back to square one, but I did have to learn a completely different kind of medicine.

When my year as a trainee was over, I started looking for a practice to join. Those were competitive times for GPs, and there were often more than 150 applicants for sought-after positions. I was lucky. I was offered a partnership with seven GPs in Trowbridge, a smallish town about a hundred miles from London. I was there for the next seventeen years, long enough to pass through several of the steps in this book. At first I was a greenhorn Journeyman, taking responsibility for my work but still with a great deal to learn. As my confidence grew, I developed my personal style as a GP. In time I began to pass my knowledge on, to teach and support other doctors as they in turn became expert.

As a GP, I developed a different way of applying the knowledge and skills I had acquired as a hospital specialist. I drew on my surgical training, but whereas in surgery you work with a patient very intensely over a relatively brief period of time, in general practice it's the opposite. You get to know your patients through repeated short encounters spread out over many years. I had the freedom to develop my own style – or what I describe in this book as ‘voice'.

在接下来的几年里，给西蒙这样的患者做手术成了例行工作。有些最紧急的患者被人刺伤了心脏。我们在周末通常会有好几例这样的患者，有时会更多。最后，我已经习惯于全速跑过走廊，去手术室为心脏快要停止跳动的患者动手术。片刻之间，我们把患者抬到手术台上，然后切开皮肤，用锤子和凿子劈开胸骨，切开心包囊，在喷血的心室上缝合。一旦情况得到控制，患者的血压上升，我们的血压下降，我们就能松一口气了，然后我们再缝合胸腔。

在巴拉瓜纳医院工作近三年之后，我觉得我已经掌握了创伤外科手术的窍门。我想丰富自己的经验，于是搬到了开普敦。

我决定在格罗特·舒尔医院继续我的训练，这所大学附属医院因世界上第一台心脏移植手术而闻名 —— 于 1967 年由克里斯蒂安、巴纳德（Christiaan Barnard）操刀。在格罗特·舒尔医院、我仍要治疗许多创伤患者，但我也在一些肝病、肠道外科、神经外科、小几外科和重症监护领域的世界一流专家手下工作过。在这些专业领域轮转，我获得了广泛的经验，事实证明这些经验是无价的。我参加了皇家外科学院终极院士资格考试，成了一名顾问医师，在开普敦儿童医院担任了几个月的小儿创伤科主任。我在名义上独立了，因此正在从学徒过渡到熟练工。

那时，我已经在南非待了五年多，但我从未打算在那里一直待下去。我父母住在伦敦，母亲患上了癌症，病情严重。我该回家了。不过在回国之前，我在奥沙卡蒂做了几个月外科顾问医师。那是纳米比亚的一个偏远小镇，也是奥万博人的故乡。到达那里的时候，我发现奥沙卡蒂位于靠近安哥拉的边境上，当时南非和安哥拉在打仗。虽然我见过很多创伤，但从未在真正的战区工作过，也没有意识到那里有多危险。我发现自己被推进了一个从未见过的世界。从任何意义上讲，这都是一次烈火的洗礼。

最难熬的是，我很孤独。在开普敦的时候，总有人问我是不是陷入了困境。在奥沙卡蒂，我才是真正的孤立无援。医院很大，光是外科就有两百多张病床，但是医院长期人手不足。我去那儿的时候，负责手术的外科医生已经连续工作三年多没有休息了。我到医院时，他手里拿着一个手提箱 —— 他当天就离开了，我再也没见过他。我发现自己要负责 200 个外科患者，只有两个实习医生协助我。

在奥沙卡蒂，我必须快速成长。除了已经在病房里的患者，每天还有新的重伤患者涌入。大部分时间里，我的工作都不是我能轻松应对的。除了日常的外科问题以外（比如给脓肿引流、处理阑尾炎），我还得照顾那些被路边爆炸装置炸伤或者被火箭弹击中的人，他们的伤势通常非常可怕。我必须学会随机应变，做那些我听过但从未见过的手术 —— 更别提做过了。

有些最可怕的伤口是白磷榴弹造成的。磷会灼烧患者的皮肤，几乎不可能去除。一位在手术室工作的奥万博姐妹教会了我该怎么做。你要给患者做全身麻醉，把他们放在手术台上，然后关掉所有的灯。你会看见患者的哪些身体部位在黑暗中发光，然后用手术刀把这些部位切掉，或者用钢丝刷将其刮掉。这就像噩梦一样。我在北威尔士做实习医生的时候，从没有人提过白磷榴弹。

这就是我所说的「成为专家之路不是平坦的直线」。在奥沙卡蒂，我在培养自己作为外科熟练工的「声音」，但这项工作的要求远远超过了我的知识与信心。我要为自己的决定负责，而我有时会犯错。然后我的患者和我就不得不面对这些后果。

当回到英格兰的时候，我来到了职业生涯的另一个转折点。作为一名在非洲行医多年的外科医生，我花了很长时间做手术，然后在患者开始康复的时候照料他们。可他们一出院，我就再也见不到他们了。我意识到，对我来说，这样的工作缺少了一些东西。我想了解患者之后多年的故事，而不是几天或几周里的事情。我也想了解其他门类的医学。

还在开普敦的时候，有一天我正在翻看一本过期的《英国医学杂志》（British Medical Journal）的最后几页。我看到一则英格兰中部城市利奇菲尔德（靠近伯明翰）招聘实习全科医生的广告，实习期为一年。截止日期早已过去，但我还是寄出了申请书。令我惊讶的是，几周后，他们回信给我，把这个职位给了我。所以我最后改变了自己的专业方向，重新接受培训，成为一名全科医生 —— 一名家庭医生。这个跨度很大，我的朋友们都认为我疯了。我知道这有些冒险，但我觉得这会很有趣。的确很有趣。

从外科转到全科很难。我还得再做一次学徒。在我做全科实习医生的时候，我学到了很多东西，不过大部分都不是新的知识或技术，而是将我的知识组合在一起的新方法。我没有完全回到起点，但我确实必须学习另一种医学。

在实习的一年结束后，我开始寻找工作机会。那时全科医生的竞争很激烈，抢手的职位经常有超过 150 个申请者。我很幸运。我得到了一个在特罗布里奇与七名全科医生合作的机会。特罗布里奇是一个距离伦敦大约 100 英里的小镇。我在那里度过了接下来的 17 年，这段时间足够让我经历本书中的几个步骤。起初，我是个初出茅庐的熟练工，为自己的工作负责，但仍有很多需要学习的东西。随着自信的增长，我开始形成自己作为全科医生的风格。随着时间的推移，我开始传授我的知识，教导和支持其他医生，而他们也逐渐成了专家。

作为全科医生，我逐渐开始用一种不同的方式来运用我从医院专科医生的生涯中所获得的知识和技能。我从外科训练中受益匪浅。不过在外科的工作中，你要在相对较短的时间里与患者做高强度的工作，而在全科的工作中，情况恰恰相反。你要通过多年来短暂、多次的接触来了解你的患者。我拥有形成自己风格的自由 —— 换言之，那就是我在本书中讲的「声音」。

### 2.3 成为学者

Becoming an academic

Once I was settled in my practice, I developed a teaching programme for GPs who wanted to carry out minor surgery. But when I tried to crystallize the surgical knowledge from my earlier career, I found it surprisingly difficult. I tried several approaches, including writing a textbook, but none of them really worked. I knew from my experience with surgical patients like Simon that books weren't always helpful, so in the end I developed a multimedia programme, working with a dermatology consultant (Julia Schofield), a recently formed simulation company (Limbs & Things) and an anatomical graphics company (Primal Pictures). We combined silicon models and computer graphics, so clinicians could practise surgical techniques at home.

Although I'd done a lot of teaching by then, I'd never studied education formally. I wanted to find out more, so I did a PhD at the nearby University of Bath. As I was studying, I linked my own experiences of teaching and learning to what people outside my field had written. I read their books, examined their theories, and tried to match them with my own ideas. That led to a third career change and took me to Imperial College London, the university where I now work.

At Imperial the wheel came full circle and I found myself with surgeons again. This time, though, I was teaching them about education rather than doing operations myself. I established a Master of Education (MEd) in Surgical Education, which for many years was the only one of its kind in the world. At the same time, I created simulations that integrated the physical skills of operating with the human skills of caring for sick people. I built a research group which has developed low-cost yet realistic recreations of surgery that can be carried in the back of a car and set up anywhere. Working with design engineers, we even developed an inflatable ‘igloo', using lightweight props to recreate the sense of being in an operating theatre without requiring extensive equipment.

My first idea had been to use this portable simulation for training surgical teams. An epiphany came when I realized it could be used in a different way – to invite patients and members of the public to see what goes on inside an operating theatre and even take part in a simulated operation. We developed the idea of ‘reciprocal illumination', a change in perspective for everyone who took part – surgeons, patients and the public.

These simulations enabled discussions with people who often felt excluded from the worlds of medicine and science. I became fascinated by public engagement, as it's called, and over the next few years this became the focus of my work. With the others in my group I put on literally hundreds of events at science festivals, museums, street fairs, public parks and music venues. In these events, I wasn't focusing on the details of anatomy and disease. Instead I was exploring the performance and craftsmanship of surgery. That led to what has become my main research – exploring points of connection with experts outside medicine.

Imperial College London is ideally placed for this. Within a few yards of the main university campus, in London's South Kensington, are some of the world's leading museums and institutions. These include the Science Museum, Victoria and Albert Museum, Natural History Museum, Royal College of Art and Royal College of Music. Not far away are the Art Workers' Guild, the City and Guilds of London Art School, the Royal Academy of Arts and the Wellcome Trust. Over the years I've developed connections with all of them.

Some of these connections have become more formal, such as the Royal College of Music and Imperial College London's Centre for Performance Science, which my RCM colleague Aaron Williamon and I established and jointly lead. In 2019, I became the Professor of Anatomy at the Royal Academy of Arts, a post first held by the famous anatomist William Hunter in 1769. Today, I work across many disciplinary boundaries to find out what it means to become expert.

我的实践工作稳定下来之后，我就为那些想做小手术的全科医生开办了一门课程。但是，一旦我试图将我从早期职业生涯中得来的外科知识具体地讲授出来，我就发现这难得出奇。

我试了几种方法，包括写教材，但没有一种方法真正奏效。治疗像西蒙这样的外科患者的经验告诉我，书籍并不总是有用的，所以我最后与皮肤科顾问医师朱莉亚·斯科菲尔德（Julia Schofield）、新成立的医疗模拟产品公司 Limbs ＆ Things，以及解剖学图形公司 Primal Pictures 合作，开发了一款多媒体软件。我们将硅胶模型和计算机图形结合在了一起，这样医生就可以在家里练习外科技术。

尽管我在此之前已经做了很多教学工作，但我从未正式研究过教育。我想了解更多，于是在附近的巴斯大学取得了哲学博士学位。在学习的时候，我把自己的教学和学习经验与我领域外的人所写的东西联系在了一起。我读了他们的书，研究了他们的理论，并试图将这些东西与我自己的想法结合起来。这促使我做出了第三次职业转型，来到了帝国理工学院，也就是我目前供职的大学。

我在帝国理工学院又回到了最初的起点，我发现自己又和外科医生待在一起了。但这一次，我是在教他们有关教育学的知识，而不是自己动手做手术。我在外科教育学方向创立了一个教育学硕士学位。多年以来，这个学位在世界上是独一无二的。与此同时，我创造的模拟设备将做手术的身体技能与照料患者的人际技能结合在了一起。我建立了一个研究小组，开发了成本低廉又逼真的外科手术复制品，它可以放进汽车的后备厢，在任何地方组装。我们甚至还与设计工程师合作，开发了一种可充气的「小屋」，你可以用轻便的道具来模拟置身于手术室的感觉，而不需要大量的设备。

我的第一个想法是用这种便携式的模拟设备来训练外科手术团队。当我意识到可以用不同的方法来利用这种设备时，我产生了顿悟－- 我可以邀请患者和公众参观手术室，甚至参加模拟手术。我们提出了「相互启发」的理念，它改变了每个参与者的视角 —— 外科医生、患者与公众。

这些模拟设备能让那些经常感觉被排斥在医学和科学世界之外的人参与讨论。我喜欢上了公众参与，在接下来的几年里，这成了我工作的焦点。我和团队里的其他人一起，在科学节、博物馆、街头集市、公园和音乐演出场所举办了数百场活动。在这些活动中，我关注的不是解剖学与疾病的细节。相反，我探索的是外科手术的呈现与技艺。这后来引出了我的主要研究领域 —— 探索能够与医学领域之外的专家产生联系的地方。伦敦帝国理工学院是从事这项工作的理想场所。在伦敦南肯辛顿主校区的几码之内，就坐落着一些世界上最好的博物馆和相关机构。其中包括科学博物馆、维多利亚与艾尔伯特博物馆、自然历史博物馆、皇家艺术学院与皇家音乐学院。不远处还有艺术工作者行会、伦敦城市与行业协会艺术学校、皇家美术学院和惠康信托基金会。多年以来，我和所有这些机构都建立了关系。

1 码≈0.91 米。

有些关系变得更加正式了，比如皇家音乐学院与伦敦帝国理工学院表现科学中心（Centre for Performance Science）的成立。该中心是由我在皇家音乐学院的同事亚伦·威廉蒙（Aaron Williamon）和我成立并共同负责的。2019 年，我成为皇家美术学院的解剖学教授，这一职位最早由著名解剖学家威廉·亨特（William Hunter）于 1769 年担任。今天，我跨越了许多学科的边界，试图弄清成为专家意味着什么。

### 2.4 裁缝

The tailor

Now to Joshua Byrne, the bespoke tailor whose ideas have influenced me so profoundly. We've both travelled from Apprentice to Master and we've both had ups and downs along the way. Though our fields are completely different, our paths have been uncannily similar.

I met Joshua on a hot summer's day in 2009, when I was developing my third career, as an academic. His workshop is near Savile Row, the London street which has been the heartland of bespoke tailoring for centuries. When I first saw him, Joshua was stooped over a half-made jacket, with the Test match commentary on the radio in the background. Tall, bearded and impeccably dressed, Joshua has a warm, attractive personality. I'd never talked to a tailor before and he'd never talked to a surgeon. Tailors and surgeons don't normally have the chance to meet, and I didn't know what to expect. He seemed as curious as I was about the idea that we might have anything in common.

The first thing I noticed was Joshua's technical skill, and how it chimed with my own experience. When he described how he makes a suit, I was struck by the way we both use sewing. As an apprentice, Joshua spent years with a needle and thread, putting sleeves on jackets and shaping the layers of a suit. I did something similar during my years as a surgeon, joining intestines or blood vessels. As we talked, we discovered more common ground. It turned out that we had each been through two apprenticeships – one focusing on technical skill, the other more about people. We were each fascinated by the principles of our craft and the ideas that underpin it.

Halfway through his second year at university, studying agriculture and economics, Joshua by chance saw a film with a brief scene in a tailor's workshop. Suddenly, he realized that was what he wanted to do. There weren't any tailoring opportunities in Edinburgh at that time, so he left university and went to London to become an apprentice. Like Derek the taxidermist, Joshua had had an epiphany which changed the course of his career.

Joshua explained to me that there are two kinds of tailors. ‘Making' (or ‘sewing') tailors are the experts in construction. They build suits and jackets to the specifications of a ‘cutting' tailor, who designs the garment and interacts with the customer. Both kinds of tailor are highly skilled, but their work is different and they inhabit separate worlds. An apprentice will usually choose one or the other, then stay on that side of the business throughout their career. But Joshua didn't do that; he trained in both. I had done something similar, changing from surgery to general practice. In doing two apprenticeships within the same world, we are both unusual within our fields.

I asked Joshua to give me a glimpse of a ‘making' tailor's work. He showed me how he sews a sleeve onto a jacket. Watching him use a needle and thread with effortless grace took me back to my time as a surgeon, suturing stab wounds in Africa. So I asked him to let me try some sewing. Even though it had been over two decades since I last performed a major operation, I thought it would be pretty straightforward. After all, I'd had years of experience – how difficult could it be?

With a jacket on my lap, a needle in my hand and only the window for a light, I found out. I felt completely useless. I floundered, unable to do the simplest thing. I seemed to have lost all those sewing skills I'd spent years perfecting. It was horrible.

Thinking about it afterwards, I realized that despite the apparent similarities between our skills, our ways of working were completely different. I was used to operating in a team, standing up under a bright light in a surgical gown and latex gloves, with people handing me instruments and sutures when I needed them and taking them away when I'd finished. Every time I wanted to put in a stitch, an expert colleague like Sister Ramaphosa would pass me a curved needle mounted on a special instrument.

In Joshua's studio all that had gone. Tailors work alone. They use straight needles, holding them directly in their fingers rather than using instruments, and there's no one to hand things over or take them away. This made me question what I thought I knew about becoming expert. I realized my skill only made sense within its setting. Changing the context by visiting Joshua had brought that abruptly into view. Away from my team I felt adrift.

Though Joshua's work and mine are different, we'd had similar experiences as we travelled the path to becoming expert. As a beginner (an Apprentice) he had to do things without understanding why. He became skilled in the techniques of his trade and gained a deep understanding of the textiles and cloth he worked with. He'd had teachers who were inspiring and supportive, but also others who were critical and hostile. Later, as an independent craftsman (a Journeyman), he developed his voice – taking risks and striking out on his own. Now, as an expert (a Master), he was articulating that knowledge and passing it on. In my time as a junior doctor, a surgical trainee in South Africa, a consultant surgeon in Namibia, a GP in rural England and a university academic in London, I'd been through those stages too.

Since our first meeting, I've spent a lot of time with Joshua. At this point in our careers we're both trying to convey our knowledge to people less experienced than ourselves. Through our conversations, we've explored what it means to be expert, and every year Joshua takes part in the master's programme I lead at Imperial. This isn't just Joshua telling my students and me about tailoring; that's interesting, but not especially relevant to us as surgeons. It's also looking at how tailors become tailors, which makes us think about how surgeons become surgeons and why. As you read on, you might think about how surgeons becoming surgeons, tailors becoming tailors – or anybody becoming anything – shines a light on your own path, and why you're walking down it.

现在谈谈约书亚·伯恩，这位定制裁缝的理念对我影响极深。我们都经历了从学徒到大师的过程，一路上都有起起伏伏。虽然我们的专业领域完全不同，但我们的道路却出奇地相似。2009 年的一个炎热的夏天，我遇见了约书亚，当时我正在发展自己的第三份职业 —— 学者。约书亚的工作室位于萨维尔街附近。几个世纪以来，伦敦的这条街道一直是定制裁缝的圣地。我第一次见到约书亚时，他正弯着腰，面前是一件做了一半的西装上衣，收音机里放着板球比赛的解说。约书亚身材高大，留着络腮胡，衣着得体，性格温和，散发着人格魅力。我从没有和裁缝说过话，他也从没有和外科医生说过话。裁缝和外科医生通常没有机会见面，我也不知道会发生什么。他似乎和我一样好奇，想知道我们能有什么共同之处。

我注意到的第一件事就是约书亚的专业技术，以及这种技术与我自身的经验有何共通之处。当他讲述如何制作西装时，我对我们俩都会用到的缝线方式感到惊讶。在学徒时期，约书亚花了数年时间学习针线，把袖子缝在上衣上，为西装的多层面料定型。我在做外科医生的时候也做过类似的事情 —— 缝合肠子或血管。随着谈话的进行，我们发现了更多的共同点。原来我们两人都经历过两次学徒期：一次关注专业技能，另一次更关注人。我们都对我们技艺的原则和支撑这门技艺的理念着迷。

约书亚在大学里的专业是农业与经济学。在二年级的时候，他在一部电影里偶然看到了一个裁缝作坊的简短场景。突然，他意识到这就是他想做的。当时在爱丁堡没有做裁缝的机会，于是他离开大学，前往伦敦当学徒。就像标本剥制师德里克一样，约书亚的一个顿悟改变了他的职业生涯。

约书亚告诉我，裁缝分为两种。「制作」（或「缝纫」）裁缝是制造的专家。他们根据「剪裁」裁缝的具体要求制作西服套装和西装上衣，而后者负责设计服装并与顾客交流。两种裁缝的技巧都很高超，但他们的工作是不同的，属于不同的领域。学徒通常会选择其中一种方向，然后在整个职业生涯中一直从事裁缝行当的这一部分，但约书亚不是这样的，他在这两方面都受过训练。我也做过类似的事情，从外科医生转做全科医生。我们都在同一专业里做了两次学徒。这在我们的领域里，都是不同寻常的。

我请约书亚让我看看「制作」裁缝的工作。他向我展示了如何把袖子缝到西装上衣上。看着他轻松自如地使用针线，我回想起自己在非洲缝合刺伤的外科医生岁月。于是我请求他让我试试缝纫。尽管我上次做大手术已经是 20 多年前的事了，但我认为这很简单。毕竟我有多年的经验 —— 这能有多难呢？

西装上衣放在腿上，手里拿着针，唯一的光源是一扇窗，我顿时发现了这有多难。我完全不知所措。我手足无措，连这最简单的事情都做不到。我似乎失去了多年来一直在完善的缝合技巧。那感觉糟透了。

事后回想起来，我意识到尽管我们的技能有明显的相似之处，但我们的工作方式却完全不同。我习惯于在团队中做手术，穿着手术服，戴着乳胶手套，站在明亮的灯光下。在我需要的时候，会有人给我递来器械和缝合线。在我缝好后，会有人把它们拿走。每当我想下针的时候，像拉马福萨护士这样专业的同事就会递给我一根装在特殊器械上的弯曲的针。

在约书亚的工作室里，所有这些都不见了。裁缝独自工作。他们用的是直针，用手指直接拿针，而不是用器械，也没有人给他们递东西，或者把东西收走。这让我开始质疑自己对于成为专家的了解。我意识到，我的技能只有在相应的情境里才有意义。到了约书亚这里，我的情境就变了。这让我突然意识到了这一点。离开了团队，我感到不知所措。

虽然约书亚的工作与我不同，但我们在成为专家的道路上有着相似的经历。作为初学者（学徒），他不得不在不明就里的情况下做事。他逐渐熟练掌握了自己的手艺，并且对工作中用到的纺织品和布料有了深刻的了解。他的老师给了他很多鼓舞和支持，但也有一些持批评和敌对态度的人。后来，作为一名独立的手艺人（熟练工），他找到了自己的「声音」—— 敢于冒险，闯出自己的一片天地。现在，作为一名专家（大师），他正在阐述自己的知识，传承自己的技艺。在我做实习医生，在南非做外科实习医生，在纳米比亚做外科顾问医师，在英格兰乡村做全科医生，以及在伦敦做大学学者的时候，我也经历过这些阶段。

自从我们初次见面以来，我和约书亚花了很多时间相处。在我们职业生涯的这个时期，我们都在努力把我们的知识传达给比我们经验更少的人。通过我们的对话，我们探索了成为专家意味着什么。约书亚每年都会参与我在帝国理工学院开办的硕士课程。这不仅是为了让约书亚给我和我的学生讲述有关裁缝的事情（那很有趣，但和我们外科医生没有什么关系），也是为了研究裁缝如何成为裁缝，让我们思考外科医生如何以及为何成为外科医生。在阅读后面的内容时，你可能会想到外科医生如何成为外科医生，裁缝如何成为裁缝（或者任何专业的成长历程）。这会为你指明道路，让你明白你为什么会走在这条路上。

### 2.5 看看自己领域外的世界

Looking outside your field

I've never become an expert quite like Derek the taxidermist and I know I never will. I've never spent forty-five years in one field. But I've developed what the sociologist Harry Collins describes as ‘interactional expertise' – the ability to speak the language of experts whose work you cannot do. Collins distinguishes this from ‘contributory expertise' – the expertise of doing the work itself – which in my case is being a doctor and a teacher. Interactional expertise involves engaging with people outside your field. Most people have interactional expertise to some extent. Some, like journalists, make it their profession. Now it has become mine, too.

It's easy to imagine science, art and craft in watertight compartments. Yet we put ourselves in a straitjacket if we think of experts solely in terms of their occupation. Categories like medicine, tailoring or taxidermy emphasize difference, not similarity; we think of what makes these experts unique, not what they have in common. And we seldom find out how they got there, or how we can apply their knowledge to ourselves.

As Joshua and I have found out, there is a lot to learn from people outside your field. I'll never make a jacket and he'll never do an operation. But on a deeper level we understand one another's stories. We've both spent years learning something we believe in, and we've both had challenging times. We've struggled to gain physical skills. We've encountered difficult teachers, students, customers and patients. And we've looked beyond our field.

My conversations with Joshua and others have helped me talk my ideas into existence. Those conversations have been instrumental in shaping what I'm trying to say. As one of my patients once said to me, ‘How do I know what I think until I hear myself tell you?'

Though Joshua's experience and mine don't coincide precisely, he sums up what being expert means to me. Joshua is driven by a passion to be the finest tailor he can be, and to do the best possible work for his customers and clients. That, to me, is the essence of mastery.

But I'm getting ahead of myself. Becoming expert is a long journey. At the start of this chapter I was in Emergency Theatre B at Bara in 1981, preparing to operate on Simon. My path had only just begun. I still remember that sick feeling as I wondered if I'd be able to cope with what I found inside his abdomen. Whatever your field, you'll have moments like that. The only solution is to build up experience, to do it over and over again. And that starts with doing time.

我从没有成为像标本剥制师德里克那样的专家，我知道我永远也不会。我从没有在一个领域里待上 45 年。但是我发展出了社会学家哈里·柯林斯（Harry Collins）所说的「互动型专长」—— 虽然你无法胜任一些专家的工作，但你能够说他们的语言。柯林斯将这种专长与「贡献型专长」（做工作本身的专长；就我个人而言，二者就是做教师和医生的工作）进行了区分。互动型专长要求你与自己领域外的人打交道。大多数人都有一定的互动型专长。有些人，比如记者，把互动型专长作为自己的职业技能。现在，它也成了我的职业技能。

人们很容易把科学、艺术和工艺看作神秘的东西，难以窥见其中的奥秘。然而，如果我们仅仅根据专家的职业来看待他们，我们就限制了自己的眼界。像医学、裁缝、标本剥制这样的分类强调差异，而不是共性；我们会考虑这些专家的独特之处，而不是他们的共同点。我们很少知道这些专家是如何走到这一步的，也不知道我们能如何将他们的知识运用到自己身上。

约书亚和我发现，在自身领域之外的人身上，还有许多东西值得学习。我永远也做不出西装上衣，而他也永远不会做手术，但在更深刻的层面上，我们都理解彼此的故事。我们都花了多年时间学习我们所相信的东西，我们都经历过充满挑战的时期。我们都曾努力习得身体技能。我们都遇见过难以应付的老师、学生、顾客和患者。我们的眼光也都超越了自身的领域。

我和约书亚及其他人的谈话，帮助我理清了自己的想法。这些对话对于我找到自己想说的话很有帮助。就像我的一位患者曾对我说的话：「如果不能听见自己亲口对你说，我怎么知道自己在想什么？」

虽然约书亚的经历与我并不完全一致，但他总结了成为专家对于我的意义。一腔热情驱使着约书亚，让他努力成为最好的裁缝，为顾客和客户做出最好的工作。在我看来，这就是掌握一门技艺的精髓。

但这是后话了。成为专家是一个漫长的过程。在本章开始的时候，我在 1981 年的巴拉瓜纳医院 B 紧急手术室，正准备给西蒙动手术。我的旅程才刚刚开始。我现在还记得怀疑自己能否处理他腹腔伤情时的那种恶心感。无论你的领域是什么，你都会有那样的时刻。唯一的解决方法就是积攒经验，一遍又一遍地做这件事。这就得从「积累」做起。
