### 1.1 Introduction 

This two-year course in physics is presented from the point of view that you, the reader, are going to be a physicist. This is not necessarily the case of course, but that is what every professor in every subject assumes! If you are going to be a physicist, you will have a lot to study: two hundred years of the most rapidly developing ﬁeld of knowledge that there is. So much knowledge, in fact, that you might think that you cannot learn all of it in four years, and truly you cannot; you will have to go to graduate school too!

Surprisingly enough, in spite of the tremendous amount of work that has been done for all this time it is possible to condense the enormous mass of results to a large extent — that is, to ﬁnd laws which summarize all our knowledge. Even so, the laws are so hard to grasp that it is unfair to you to start exploring this tremendous subject without some kind of map or outline of the relationship of one part of the subject of science to another. Following these preliminary remarks, the ﬁrst three chapters will therefore outline the relation of physics to the rest of the sciences, the relations of the sciences to each other, and the meaning of science, to help us develop a「feel」for the subject.

You might ask why we cannot teach physics by just giving the basic laws on page one and then showing how they work in all possible circumstances, as we do in Euclidean geometry, where we state the axioms and then make all sorts of deductions. (So, not satisﬁed to learn physics in four years, you want to learn it in four minutes?) We cannot do it in this way for two reasons. First, we do not yet know all the basic laws: there is an expanding frontier of ignorance. Second, the correct statement of the laws of physics involves some very unfamiliar ideas which require advanced mathematics for their description. Therefore, one needs a considerable amount of preparatory training even to learn what the words mean. No, it is not possible to do it that way. We can only do it piece by piece.

Each piece, or part, of the whole of nature is always merely an approximation to the complete truth, or the complete truth so far as we know it. In fact, everything we know is only some kind of approximation, because we know that we do not know all the laws as yet. Therefore, things must be learned only to be unlearned again or, more likely, to be corrected. The principle of science, the deﬁnition, almost, is the following: The test of all knowledge is experiment. Experiment is the sole judge of scientiﬁc「truth.」But what is the source of knowledge? Where do the laws that are to be tested come from? Experiment, itself, helps to produce these laws, in the sense that it gives us hints. But also needed is imagination to create from these hints the great generalizations — to guess at the wonderful, simple, but very strange patterns beneath them all, and then to experiment to check again whether we have made the right guess. This imagining process is so diﬃcult that there is a division of labor in physics: there are theoretical physicists who imagine, deduce, and guess at new laws, but do not experiment; and then there are experimental physicists who experiment, imagine, deduce, and guess. 

We said that the laws of nature are approximate: that we ﬁrst ﬁnd the「wrong」ones, and then we ﬁnd the「right」ones. Now, how can an experiment be「wrong」? First, in a trivial way: if something is wrong with the apparatus that you did not notice. But these things are easily ﬁxed, and checked back and forth. So without snatching at such minor things, how can the results of an experiment be wrong? Only by being inaccurate. For example, the mass of an object never seems to change: a spinning top has the same weight as a still one. So a「law」was invented: mass is constant, independent of speed. That「law」is now found to be incorrect. Mass is found to increase with velocity, but appreciable increases require velocities near that of light. A true law is: if an object moves with a speed of less than one hundred miles a second the mass is constant to within one part in a million. In some such approximate form this is a correct law. So in practice one might think that the new law makes no signiﬁcant diﬀerence. Well, yes and no. For ordinary speeds we can certainly forget it and use the simple constant-mass law as a good approximation. But for high speeds we are wrong, and the higher the speed, the more wrong we are.

Finally, and most interesting, philosophically we are completely wrong with the approximate law. Our entire picture of the world has to be altered even though the mass changes only by a little bit. This is a very peculiar thing about the philosophy, or the ideas, behind the laws. Even a very small eﬀect sometimes requires profound changes in our ideas.

Now, what should we teach ﬁrst? Should we teach the correct but unfamiliar law with its strange and diﬃcult conceptual ideas, for example the theory of relativity, four-dimensional space-time, and so on? Or should we ﬁrst teach the simple「constant-mass」law, which is only approximate, but does not involve such diﬃcult ideas? The ﬁrst is more exciting, more wonderful, and more fun, but the second is easier to get at ﬁrst, and is a ﬁrst step to a real understanding of the ﬁrst idea. This point arises again and again in teaching physics. At diﬀerent times we shall have to resolve it in diﬀerent ways, but at each stage it is worth learning what is now known, how accurate it is, how it ﬁts into everything else, and how it may be changed when we learn more.

Let us now proceed with our outline, or general map, of our understanding of science today (in particular, physics, but also of other sciences on the periphery), so that when we later concentrate on some particular point we will have some idea of the background, why that particular point is interesting, and how it ﬁts into the big structure. So, what is our over-all picture of the world?

1-1 引言

这是一门两学年的物理课，我们开设这门课程是着眼于你们，读者们，将成为物理学工作者。当然，情况并非一定如此，但是每门学科的教授都是这样设想的：假如你打算成为个物理学工作者，就要学习很多东西；这是一个 200 年以来空前勃发展的知识领域。事实上，你会想到，这么多的知识是不可能在四年内学完的，确实不可能；你们还得到研究院去继续学习。

相当出人意外的是，尽管在这么长时间中做了极其大量的工作，但却有可能把这一大堆成果大大地加以浓缩。这就是说，找到一些概括我们所有知识的定律。不过，即使如此，掌握这些定律也是颇为困难的。因此，在你对科学的这部分与那部分题材之间的关系还没有一个大致的了解之前，就让你去钻研这个庞大的课题的话，就不公平了。根据这种法：前三章将略述物理学与其他科学的关系，各门学科之间的相互联系以及科学的含义，这有助于你们对本学科产生一种切身的感受。

你们可能会问，在讲欧几里德几何时，先是陈述公理，然后作出各种各样的推论，那为什么在讲授物理学时不能先直截了当地列出基本定律，然后再就一切可能的情况说明定律的应用呢？（这样一来，如果你不满足于要花四年时间来学习物理，那你是否打算在 4 分钟内学完它？）我们不能这样做是由于两个理由。第一，我们还不知道所有的基本定律：未知领域的边界在不断地扩展。第二，正确地叙述物理定律要涉及到一些非常陌生的概念，而叙述这些概念又要用到高等数学。因此，即使为了知道词的含义，也需要大量的预备性的训练的确，那样做是行不通的，我们只能一步一步地来。

大自然整体的每一部分始终只不过是对于整个真理一或者说，对于我们至今所了解的整个真理 一一 的逼近。实际上，人们知道的每件事都只是某种近似，因为我们懂得，到目前为止，我们确实还不知道所有的定律，因此，我们之所以需要学习一些东西，正是为了要抛弃以前的谬见，或者更可能的是为了改正以前的谬见。

科学的原则 —— 或者简直可称为科学的定义为：实验是一切知识的试金石。实验是科学「真理」的唯一鉴定者。但是什么是知识的源泉呢？那些要检验的定律又是从何而来的呢？从某种意义上说，实验为我们提供了种种线索，因此可以说是实验本身促成了这些定律的产生。但是，要从这些线索中作出重大的判断，还需要有丰富的想象力去对蕴藏在所有这些线索后面的令人惊讶、简单、而又非常奇特的图象进行猜测，然后，再用实验来验证我们的猜测究竟对不对。这个想象过程是很艰难的，因此在物理学中有所分工，理论物理学家进行想象、推演和猜测新的定律，但并不做实验；而实验物理学家则进行实验、想象、推演和猜测。

我们说过，自然的定律是近似的：起先我们找到的是「错」的定律，然后オ发现「对」的定律。那么，一个实验怎么可能是「错误」的呢？首先，通常是：仪器上有些毛病，而你又没有注意，但是这种问题是容易确定的，可以反复检查。如果不去纠缠在这种次要的问题上，那么实验的结果怎么可能是错误的呢？这只可能是由于不够精确罢了。

例如，一个物体的质量似乎是从来不变的：转动的陀螺与静止的陀螺一样重。结果就发现了一条「定律」：质量是个常数，与速率无关。然而现在发现这条「定律」却是不正确的。质量实际上随着速度的加大而增加，但是要速度接近于光速，才会显著增加。正确的定律是：如果一个物体的速率小于 100 海里 / 秒，那么它的质量的变化不超过百万分之一，在这种近似形式下，这就是一条正确的定律。因此，人们可能认为新的定律实际上并没有什么有意义的差别。当然，这可以说对，也可以说不对。对于一般的速率我们当然可以忘掉它，而用简单的质量守恒定律作为一种很好的近似。但是对于高速情况这就不正确了：速率越高，就越不正确。

最后，最有趣的是，就哲学上而言，使用近似的定律是完全错误的。纵然质量的变化只是一点点，我们的整个世界图景也得改变。这是有关在定律后面的哲学或基本观念的一件十分特殊的事。即使是极小的效应有时在我们的观念上也要引起深刻的变化。

那么，我们应该首先教什么呢？是否应先教那些正确的、陌生的定律以及有关的奇特而困难的观念，例如相对论，四维时空等等之类？还是应先教简单的「质量守恒」定律，即那条虽然只是近似的，但并不包含那种困难的观念的定律？前一条定律比较引人入胜，比较奇特和比较有趣，但是后一条定律在开姈时比较容易掌握，它是真正理解前一种观念的第一步。这个问题在物理教学中会一再出现，在不同的时候，我们将要用不同的方式去解决它。但是在每个阶段都值得去弄明白：我们现在所知道的是什么，它的正确性如何，它怎样适应其他各种事情，以及当我们进一步学习后它会有怎样的变化。

让我们按照我们所理解的当代科学（特别是物理学，但是也包括周围有关的其他科学）的轮廓继续讲下去，这样，当我们以后专门注意某些特殊问题时，就会对于背景情况有所了解 —— 为什么这些特殊问题是有趣的，它们又是怎样适应整体结构的。那么，我们世界的总体图象是怎样的呢？

### 1.2 Matter is made of atoms 

If, in some cataclysm, all of scientiﬁc knowledge were to be destroyed, and only one sentence passed on to the next generations of creatures, what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words? I believe it is the atomic hypothesis (or the atomic fact, or whatever you wish to call it) that all things are made of atoms — little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another. In that one sentence, you will see, there is an enormous amount of information about the world, if just a little imagination and thinking are applied. To illustrate the power of the atomic idea, suppose that we have a drop of water a quarter of an inch on the side. If we look at it very closely we see nothing but water — smooth, continuous water. Even if we magnify it with the best optical microscope available — roughly two thousand times — then the water drop will be roughly forty feet across, about as big as a large room, and if we looked rather closely, we would still see relatively smooth water — but here and there small football-shaped things swimming back and forth. Very interesting. These are paramecia. You may stop at this point and get so curious about the paramecia with their wiggling cilia and twisting bodies that you go no further, except perhaps to magnify the paramecia still more and see inside. 

This, of course, is a subject for biology, but for the present we pass on and look still more closely at the water material itself, magnifying it two thousand times again. Now the drop of water extends about ﬁfteen miles across, and if we look very closely at it we see a kind of teeming, something which no longer has a smooth appearance — it looks something like a crowd at a football game as seen from a very great distance. In order to see what this teeming is about, we will magnify it another two hundred and ﬁfty times and we will see something similar to what is shown in Fig. 1-1. This is a picture of water magniﬁed a billion times, but idealized in several ways. In the ﬁrst place, the particles are drawn in a simple manner with sharp edges, which is inaccurate. Secondly, for simplicity, they are sketched almost schematically in a two-dimensional arrangement, but of course they are moving around in three dimensions. Notice that there are two kinds of「blobs」or circles to represent the atoms of oxygen (black) and hydrogen (white), and that each oxygen has two hydrogens tied to it. (Each little group of an oxygen with its two hydrogens is called a molecule.) The picture is idealized further in that the real particles in nature are continually jiggling and bouncing, turning and twisting around one another. You will have to imagine this as a dynamic rather than a static picture. Another thing that cannot be illustrated in a drawing is the fact that the particles are「stuck together」 — that they attract each other, this one pulled by that one, etc. The whole group is「glued together,」so to speak. On the other hand, the particles do not squeeze through each other. If you try to squeeze two of them too close together, they repel.

The atoms are 1 or 2×10−8 cm in radius. Now 10−8 cm is called an angstrom (just as another name), so we say they are 1 or 2 angstroms (Å) in radius. Another way to remember their size is this: if an apple is magniﬁed to the size of the earth, then the atoms in the apple are approximately the size of the original apple.

Now imagine this great drop of water with all of these jiggling particles stuck together and tagging along with each other. The water keeps its volume; it does not fall apart, because of the attraction of the molecules for each other. If the drop is on a slope, where it can move from one place to another, the water will ﬂow, but it does not just disappear — things do not just ﬂy apart — because of the molecular attraction. Now the jiggling motion is what we represent as heat: when we increase the temperature, we increase the motion. If we heat the water, the jiggling increases and the volume between the atoms increases, and if the heating continues there comes a time when the pull between the molecules is not enough to hold them together and they do ﬂy apart and become separated from one another. Of course, this is how we manufacture steam out of water — by increasing the temperature; the particles ﬂy apart because of the increased motion.

In Fig. 1-2 we have a picture of steam. This picture of steam fails in one respect: at ordinary atmospheric pressure there certainly would not be as many as three water molecules in this ﬁgure. Most squares this size would contain none — but we accidentally have two and a half or three in the picture (just so it would not be completely blank). Now in the case of steam we see the characteristic molecules more clearly than in the case of water. For simplicity, the molecules are drawn so that there is a 120◦ angle between the hydrogen atoms. In actual fact the angle is 105◦30, and the distance between the center of a hydrogen and the center of the oxygen is 0.957 Å, so we know this molecule very well.

Let us see what some of the properties of steam vapor or any other gas are. The molecules, being separated from one another, will bounce against the walls. Imagine a room with a number of tennis balls (a hundred or so) bouncing around in perpetual motion. When they bombard the wall, this pushes the wall away.

(Of course we would have to push the wall back.) This means that the gas exerts a jittery force which our coarse senses (not being ourselves magniﬁed a billion times) feel only as an average push. In order to conﬁne a gas we must apply a pressure. Figure 1-3 shows a standard vessel for holding gases (used in all textbooks), a cylinder with a piston in it. Now, it makes no diﬀerence what the shapes of water molecules are, so for simplicity we shall draw them as tennis balls or little dots. These things are in perpetual motion in all directions. So many of them are hitting the top piston all the time that to keep it from being patiently knocked out of the tank by this continuous banging, we shall have to hold the piston down by a certain force, which we call the pressure (really, the pressure times the area is the force). Clearly, the force is proportional to the area, for if we increase the area but keep the number of molecules per cubic centimeter the same, we increase the number of collisions with the piston in the same proportion as the area was increased.

Now let us put twice as many molecules in this tank, so as to double the density, and let them have the same speed, i.e., the same temperature. Then, to a close approximation, the number of collisions will be doubled, and since each will be just as「energetic」as before, the pressure is proportional to the density. If we consider the true nature of the forces between the atoms, we would expect a slight decrease in pressure because of the attraction between the atoms, and a slight increase because of the ﬁnite volume they occupy. Nevertheless, to an excellent approximation, if the density is low enough that there are not many atoms, the pressure is proportional to the density.

We can also see something else: If we increase the temperature without changing the density of the gas, i.e., if we increase the speed of the atoms, what is going to happen to the pressure? Well, the atoms hit harder because they are moving faster, and in addition they hit more often, so the pressure increases. You see how simple the ideas of atomic theory are.

Let us consider another situation. Suppose that the piston moves inward, so that the atoms are slowly compressed into a smaller space. What happens when an atom hits the moving piston? Evidently it picks up speed from the collision. You can try it by bouncing a ping-pong ball from a forward-moving paddle, for example, and you will ﬁnd that it comes oﬀ with more speed than that with which it struck. (Special example: if an atom happens to be standing still and the piston hits it, it will certainly move.) So the atoms are「hotter」when they come away from the piston than they were before they struck it. Therefore all the atoms which are in the vessel will have picked up speed. This means that when we compress a gas slowly, the temperature of the gas increases. So, under slow compression, a gas will increase in temperature, and under slow expansion it will decrease in temperature. 

We now return to our drop of water and look in another direction. Suppose that we decrease the temperature of our drop of water. Suppose that the jiggling of the molecules of the atoms in the water is steadily decreasing. We know that there are forces of attraction between the atoms, so that after a while they will not be able to jiggle so well. What will happen at very low temperatures is indicated in Fig. 1-4: the molecules lock into a new pattern which is ice. This particular schematic diagram of ice is wrong because it is in two dimensions, but it is right qualitatively. The interesting point is that the material has a deﬁnite place for every atom, and you can easily appreciate that if somehow or other we were to hold all the atoms at one end of the drop in a certain arrangement, each atom in a certain place, then because of the structure of interconnections, which is rigid, the other end miles away (at our magniﬁed scale) will have a deﬁnite location. So if we hold a needle of ice at one end, the other end resists our pushing it aside, unlike the case of water, in which the structure is broken down because of the increased jiggling so that the atoms all move around in diﬀerent ways. 

The diﬀerence between solids and liquids is, then, that in a solid the atoms are arranged in some kind of an array, called a crystalline array, and they do not have a random position at long distances; the position of the atoms on one side of the crystal is determined by that of other atoms millions of atoms away on the other side of the crystal. 

Figure 1-4 is an invented arrangement for ice, and although it contains many of the correct features of ice, it is not the true arrangement. One of the correct features is that there is a part of the symmetry that is hexagonal. You can see that if we turn the picture around an axis by 60◦, the picture returns to itself. So there is a symmetry in the ice which accounts for the six-sided appearance of snowﬂakes. Another thing we can see from Fig. 1-4 is why ice shrinks when it melts. The particular crystal pattern of ice shown here has many「holes」in it, as does the true ice structure. When the organization breaks down, these holes can be occupied by molecules. Most simple substances, with the exception of water and type metal, expand upon melting, because the atoms are closely packed in the solid crystal and upon melting need more room to jiggle around, but an open structure collapses, as in the case of water.

Figure 1-4

Now although ice has a「rigid」crystalline form, its temperature can change —  ice has heat. If we wish, we can change the amount of heat. What is the heat in the case of ice? The atoms are not standing still. They are jiggling and vibrating. So even though there is a deﬁnite order to the crystal — a deﬁnite structure — all of the atoms are vibrating「in place.」As we increase the temperature, they vibrate with greater and greater amplitude, until they shake themselves out of place. We call this melting. As we decrease the temperature, the vibration decreases and decreases until, at absolute zero, there is a minimum amount of vibration that the atoms can have, but not zero. This minimum amount of motion that atoms can have is not enough to melt a substance, with one exception: helium. Helium merely decreases the atomic motions as much as it can, but even at absolute zero there is still enough motion to keep it from freezing. Helium, even at absolute zero, does not freeze, unless the pressure is made so great as to make the atoms squash together. If we increase the pressure, we can make it solidify.

1-2 物质是原子构成的

假如由于某种大灾难，所有的科学知识都丢失了，只有一句话传给下一代，那么怎样才能用最少的词汇来表达最多的信息呢？我相信这句话是原子的假设（或者说原子的事实，无论你愿意怎样称呼都行）：所有的物体都是用原子构成的 一一 这些原子是一些小小的粒子，它们一直不停地运动着。当彼此略微离开时相互吸引，当彼此过于挤紧时又互相排斥。只要稍微想一下，你就会发现，在这一句话中包含了大量的有关世界的信息。

为了说明原子观念的重要作用，假设有一滴直径为 1/4 英寸的水滴，即使我们非常贴近地观察，也只能见到光滑的、连续的水，而没有任何其他东西。并且即使我们用最好的光学显微憶（大致可放大 2000 倍）把这滴水放大到 40 英尺左右（相当于个大房间那样大），然后再靠得相当近地去观察，我们所看到的仍然是比较光滑的水，不过到处有一些足球状的东西在来回游动，非常有趣。这些东西是草履虫，你们可能就到此为止，对草履虫以及它的摆动的纤毛和卷曲的身体感到十分好奇。也许除了把草履虫放得更大些，看看它的内部外，就不再进一步观察了。当然这是生物学的课题，但是现在我们继续观察下去，再把水放大 200 倍更接近地观察水这种物质本身。这时，水滴已放大到有 15 英里那样大了，如果你再十分贴近地观察，你将看到水中充满了某种不再具有光滑外表的东，而是有些象从远处看过去挤在足球场上的人群。为了能看出挤满的究竟是些什么东西，我们再把它放大 250 倍后就会看到某种类似于图 1-1 所示的情形。

这是放大了 10 亿倍的水的图象，但是在以下这几方面是理想化了的首先，各种粒子用简单的方式画成有明显的边缘，这是不精确的。其次，为了简便起见，把它们都画成二维的排列，实际上它们当然是在三维空间中运动的。注意在图中有两类「斑点」或圆，它们各表示氧原子（黑色）和氢原子（白色），而每个氧原子有两个氢原子和它联结在一起（一个氧原子与两个氢原子组成的一个小组称为一个分子）。图象中还有个被理想化的地方是自然界中的真实粒子总是在不停地跳动，彼此绕来绕去地转着，因而你必须把这幅画面想象成能动的而不是静止的。另一件不能在图上说明的事实是粒子为「粘在一起」的，它们彼此吸引着，这个被那个拉住等等，可以说，整个一群「胶合在一起」。另一方面，这些粒子也不是挤到一块儿，如果你把两个粒子挤得很紧，它们就互相推斥。

原子的半径约为 1-2x10^-8 厘米，10^-8 厘米现在称为 1A（这只是另一个名称），所以我们说原子的半径为 1-2A。另一个记住原子大小的方法是这样的：如果把苹果放大到地球那样大，那么苹果中的原子就差不多有原来的苹果那样大。

1-2『上面对原子尺寸的比喻真贴切，一下子有了感性认知，费曼 NB 就 NB 在这一点上，他总是能给你举一些很贴切的例子把高深的东西讲的特别通俗。做一张信息数据卡片。』—— 已完成

现在，想象这个大水滴是由所有这些跳动的粒子一个挨一个地「粘合」起来的，水能保持一定的体积而并不散开，因为它的分子彼此吸引。如果水滴在一个斜面上，它能从一个位置移动到另一个位置。水会流动，但是并不会消失 一一 它们并没有飞逝，因为分子之间有吸引力。这种跳动就是我们所说的热运动。当温度升高时这种运动就增强了。如果我们加热水滴，跳动就增加，原子之间的空隙也增大。如果继续加热到分子间的引力不足以将彼此拉住时，它们就分开来飞散了。当然，这正是我们从水制取水蒸气的方法 —— 提高温度。粒子由于运动的增强而飞散。

图 1-2 是一幅水蒸气的图象。这张水蒸气图象有一个不足之处：在通常的气压下在整个房间里只有少数几个分子。决不可能在这样一张图象中有三个以上的分子。在大多数情况下，这样大小的方块中可能连一个都不会有 一一 不过碰巧在这张图中有两个半或三个分子（只有这样图象才不会是完全空白的）。现在，比起水来，在水蒸气的情况下，我们可以更清楚地看到水所特有的分子。为了简单起见，将分子画成具有 120° 的夹角，实际上，这个角是 105°3'，氢原子中心与氧原子中心之间的距离是 0.957A。这样看来，我们对这个分子了解得很清楚了。

让我们来看一下，水蒸气或任何其他气体具有一些什么性质。这些气体分子是彼此分离的，它们打在墙上时，会反弹回来。设想在一个房间里有一些网球（100 个左右）不断地来回跳动，当它们打到墙上后，就将墙推离原位（当然，我们必须将墙推回去）。这意味着，气体施加一个「颤动」的力，而我们的粗糙的感官（并没有被我们自己放大十亿倍）只感到一个平均的推力。为了把气体限制在一定的范围之内，我们必须施加一个压力。图 1-3 是一个盛气体的标准容器（所有教科书中都有这种图），一个配有活塞的汽缸，由于不论水分子的形状如何，情况都是一样，因此为简单起见，我们把它们画成网球形状或者小黑点。这些东西沿着所有的方向不停地运动着。由于有这么多的气体分子一直在撞击顶端的活塞，因此要使活塞不被这不断的碰撞逐渐顶出来必须施加一定的力把活塞下去，这个力称为压力（实际上，是压强乘以面积）。很清楚，这个力正比于面积，因为如果我们增大面积而保持每立方厘米内的分子数不变的话，那么分子与活塞碰撞次数增加的比例与面积增加的比例是相同的。

现在，让我们在这个容器内放入两倍的分子，以使密度增加一，同时让它们具有同样的速度，即相同的温度。那么，作为一种很好的近似，碰撞的次数也将增加一倍，由于每次碰撞仍然和先前那样「有力」，压力就正比于密度。如果我们考虑到原子之间的力的真实性质，那么由于原子之间的吸引，可以预期压力略有减少；而由于原子也占有有限的体积，则可以预期压力略有增加。无论如何，作为一个很好的近似，如果原子较少，密度足够低，那么，压力正比于密度。

我们还可以看一下其他情况。如果提高温度而不改变气体密度，亦即只增加原子的速度，那么在压力上会出现什么情况？当然，原子将撞击得更剧烈一些，因为它们运动得更快一些，此外，它们的碰撞更频繁了，因此压力将增加，你们看，原子理论的概念是多么简单！

我们来考虑另一种情况，假定活塞向下移动，原子就慢慢地被压缩在一个较小的空间里。当原子碰到运动着的活塞时，会发生什么情况呢？很显然，原子由于碰撞而提高了速率，例如，你可以试一下乒乓球从一个朝前运动的球拍弹回来时的情况，你会发现弹回的速率比打到球拍上的速率更大些（一个特例是：如果一个原子恰好静止不动，那么在活塞碰上它以后，当然就运动了）。这样原子在弹离活塞时比碰上去之前更「热」。因此所有容器中的分子的速率都提高了。这意味着，当我们缓慢压缩气体时，气体的温度会升高。结果，在慢压缩时，气体的温度将升高；而在缓慢膨胀时，气体的温度将降低。

现在回到我们的那滴水上去，从另一个角度去观察一下。假定现在降低水滴的温度，并且假定水的原子、分子的跳动逐渐减小。我们知道在原子之间存在着引力，因而过一会儿，它们就不能再跳得那么厉害了。图 1-4 表示在很低的温度下会出现什么样的情况。这时分子连接成一种新的图象，这就是冰。这个特殊的冰的图象是不正确的，因为它只是二维的，但是它在定性上是正确的。有趣的一点是，对于每一个原子，都有它的确定位置。你们可以很容易地设想，如果我们用某种方式使冰粒一端的所有的原子按一定的方式排列，并让每个原子处在一定的位置上，那么由于互相连接的结构很牢固，几英里之外（在我们放大的比例下）的另一端也将有确定的位置。如果们抓住一根冰棍的一端，另一端就会阻止我们把它拉出去，这种情况不象水那样由于跳动加强以致所有的原子以种种方式到处跑来跑去，因而结构也就被破坏了。

固体与液体的差别就在于：在固体中，原子以某种称为晶体排列的方式排列着，即使在较长的距离上它们的位置也不能杂乱无章。晶体一端的原子位置取决于晶体另一端的与之相距千百万个原子的排列位置。图 1-4 是一种虚构的冰的排列状况，它虽然包括了冰的许多正确的特征，但并不是真实的排列情况。正确的特征之一是这里具有一种六边形的对称性。你们可以看到：如果把画面绕一根轴转动 120° 的话，它仍然回到原来的形状，因此，在冰里存在着一定的对称性，这说明为什么雪花具有六边形的外表。从图 1-4 中还可以看到为什么冰融解时会缩小。在这里列出的冰的晶体图样中有许多「孔」，真实的冰的结构也是如此，在排列打散后，这些孔就可以容纳分子。除水和活字合金外，许多简单的物质在融解时都要膨胀，因为在固体的晶体结构中，原子是密集堆积的，而当熔解时，需要有更多的空间供原子活动，但是开放结构则会倒坍，体积反而收缩了，就象水的情况那样。

虽然冰有一种「刚性的」结晶形态，它的温度也会变化 —— 冰也储存热量，如果我们愿意的语，就可以改变热量的储存。对冰来说，这种热量指的是什么呢？冰的原子并不是静止不动的，它们不断地摇晃着、振动着，所以虽然晶体存在着一种确定的次序 —— 一种确定的结构，所有的原子仍都「在适当的位置」上振动，当我们提高温度时，它们振动的幅度就越来越大，直到离开原来的位置为止。我们把这个过程称为熔解，当降低温度时，振动的幅度越来越小，直到绝对零度原子仍能有最低限度的振动，而不是停止振动。原子所具有的这种最低的振动不足以使物质熔解，只有一个例外，即氦。在温度降低时，原子的运动只是尽可能地弱，但即使在绝对零度时也有足够的运动使之不致于凝固，除非把压力加得这样大，以致将原子都挤在一起。如果我们提高压力，就可以使它凝固。

### 1.3 Atomic processes 

So much for the description of solids, liquids, and gases from the atomic point of view. However, the atomic hypothesis also describes processes, and so we shall now look at a number of processes from an atomic standpoint. 

The ﬁrst process that we shall look at is associated with the surface of the water. What happens at the surface of the water? We shall now make the picture more complicated — and more realistic — by imagining that the surface is in air. Figure 1-5 shows the surface of water in air. We see the water molecules as before, forming a body of liquid water, but now we also see the surface of the water. Above the surface we ﬁnd a number of things: First of all there are water molecules, as in steam. This is water vapor, which is always found above liquid water. (There is an equilibrium between the steam vapor and the water which will be described later.) In addition we ﬁnd some other molecules — here two oxygen atoms stuck together by themselves, forming an oxygen molecule, there two nitrogen atoms also stuck together to make a nitrogen molecule. Air consists almost entirely of nitrogen, oxygen, some water vapor, and lesser amounts of carbon dioxide, argon, and other things. So above the water surface is the air, a gas, containing some water vapor. Now what is happening in this picture? The molecules in the water are always jiggling around. From time to time, one on the surface happens to be hit a little harder than usual, and gets knocked away. It is hard to see that happening in the picture because it is a still picture. But we can imagine that one molecule near the surface has just been hit and is ﬂying out, or perhaps another one has been hit and is ﬂying out. Thus, molecule by molecule, the water disappears — it evaporates. But if we close the vessel above, after a while we shall ﬁnd a large number of molecules of water amongst the air molecules. From time to time, one of these vapor molecules comes ﬂying down to the water and gets stuck again. So we see that what looks like a dead, uninteresting thing — a glass of water with a cover, that has been sitting there for perhaps twenty years — really contains a dynamic and interesting phenomenon which is going on all the time. To our eyes, our crude eyes, nothing is changing, but if we could see it a billion times magniﬁed, we would see that from its own point of view it is always changing: molecules are leaving the surface, molecules are coming back.

Why do we see no change? Because just as many molecules are leaving as are coming back! In the long run「nothing happens.」If we then take the top of the vessel oﬀ and blow the moist air away, replacing it with dry air, then the number of molecules leaving is just the same as it was before, because this depends on the jiggling of the water, but the number coming back is greatly reduced because there are so many fewer water molecules above the water. Therefore there are more going out than coming in, and the water evaporates. Hence, if you wish to evaporate water turn on the fan!

Here is something else: Which molecules leave? When a molecule leaves it is due to an accidental, extra accumulation of a little bit more than ordinary energy, which it needs if it is to break away from the attractions of its neighbors. Therefore, since those that leave have more energy than the average, the ones that are left have less average motion than they had before. So the liquid gradually cools if it evaporates. Of course, when a molecule of vapor comes from the air to the water below there is a sudden great attraction as the molecule approaches the surface. This speeds up the incoming molecule and results in generation of heat. So when they leave they take away heat; when they come back they generate heat. Of course when there is no net evaporation the result is nothing — the water is not changing temperature. If we blow on the water so as to maintain a continuous preponderance in the number evaporating, then the water is cooled. Hence, blow on soup to cool it!

Of course you should realize that the processes just described are more complicated than we have indicated. Not only does the water go into the air, but also, from time to time, one of the oxygen or nitrogen molecules will come in and「get lost」in the mass of water molecules, and work its way into the water. Thus the air dissolves in the water; oxygen and nitrogen molecules will work their way into the water and the water will contain air. If we suddenly take the air away from the vessel, then the air molecules will leave more rapidly than they come in, and in doing so will make bubbles. This is very bad for divers, as you may know. 

Now we go on to another process. In Fig. 1-6 we see, from an atomic point of view, a solid dissolving in water. If we put a crystal of salt in the water, what will happen? Salt is a solid, a crystal, an organized arrangement of「salt atoms.」

Figure 1-7 is an illustration of the three-dimensional structure of common salt, sodium chloride. Strictly speaking, the crystal is not made of atoms, but of what we call ions. An ion is an atom which either has a few extra electrons or has lost a few electrons. In a salt crystal we ﬁnd chlorine ions (chlorine atoms with an extra electron) and sodium ions (sodium atoms with one electron missing). The ions all stick together by electrical attraction in the solid salt, but when we put them in the water we ﬁnd, because of the attractions of the negative oxygen and positive hydrogen for the ions, that some of the ions jiggle loose. In Fig. 1-6 we see a chlorine ion getting loose, and other atoms ﬂoating in the water in the form of ions. This picture was made with some care. Notice, for example, that the hydrogen ends of the water molecules are more likely to be near the chlorine ion,

while near the sodium ion we are more likely to ﬁnd the oxygen end, because the sodium is positive and the oxygen end of the water is negative, and they attract electrically. Can we tell from this picture whether the salt is dissolving in water or crystallizing out of water? Of course we cannot tell, because while some of the atoms are leaving the crystal other atoms are rejoining it. The process is a dynamic one, just as in the case of evaporation, and it depends on whether there is more or less salt in the water than the amount needed for equilibrium. By equilibrium we mean that situation in which the rate at which atoms are leaving just matches the rate at which they are coming back. If there is almost no salt in the water, more atoms leave than return, and the salt dissolves. If, on the other hand, there are too many「salt atoms,」more return than leave, and the salt is crystallizing.

In passing, we mention that the concept of a molecule of a substance is only approximate and exists only for a certain class of substances. It is clear in the case of water that the three atoms are actually stuck together. It is not so clear in the case of sodium chloride in the solid. There is just an arrangement of sodium and chlorine ions in a cubic pattern. There is no natural way to group them as「molecules of salt.」

Returning to our discussion of solution and precipitation, if we increase the temperature of the salt solution, then the rate at which atoms are taken away is increased, and so is the rate at which atoms are brought back. It turns out to be very difficult, in general, to predict which way it is going to go, whether more or less of the solid will dissolve. Most substances dissolve more, but some substances dissolve less, as the temperature increases.

1-3 原子过程

关于从原子的观点来描固体、液体和气体，我们就讲到这里。然而原子的假设也可以描写过程，所以我们现在从原子的观点来考察一些过程。

我们要考察的第一个过程与水的表面有关。在水的表面有些什么情况呢？设想水的表面上是空气，现在我们来把图画得更复杂一些 —— 也更实际一些，如图 1-5 所示。我们看到，水分子仍然象先前那样，组成大量的水，但现在还看到水的表面。在水面上我们发现一些东西：首先，水面上有水的分子，这就是水的蒸气，在水面上总是有水蒸气的（在水蒸气与水之间存在着一种平衡，这种平衡我们以后再讲。) 此外，我们还发现一些别的分子：这里是两个氧原子彼此结合在一起组成一个氧分子，那里是两个氮原子结合在一起组成一个氮分子。空气几乎完全是由氮气、氧气、水蒸气组成的，此外还有少量的二氧化碳、氩气和其他一些气体。所以在水面上的是含有一些水蒸气的气体。那么，在这种情况下会发生什么事呢？

水里的分子不断地晃来晃去。有时，在水面上有个别分子碰巧受到比通常情况下更大的冲击而被「踢」出表面。因为图 1-5 是静止的画面，所以在图上难以看出所发生的。但是我们可以想象表面附近的某一个分子刚好受到碰撞而飞了出去，或者也许另一个分子也受到碰撞而飞了出去。分子一个接着一个地跑了出去，水就消失了 —— 蒸发了。但是如果把容器盖上，过了会儿就会发现在空气分子中有大量的水分子。水蒸气的分子不时地飞到水面，又回到水中。结果，我们看到那个看来死气沉沉的、无趣的事情 一一 一杯盖上的可能已放了二十年的水 —— 实在包含了一直生气勃勃而有趣的现象。对我们这双肉眼而言，看不出有任何变化，但是如果能放大十亿倍来看的话，我们就能发现情况一直在变化：一些分子离开水面，又些分子则回到了水面。

为什么我们看不出变化呢？因为有多少分子离开水面就会有多少分子回到水面！归根到底「没有任何事情发生」如果现在我们把容器盖打开，使潮湿的空气吹走而代之以干燥空气，那么离开水面的分子数还是如先前那样多，因为这只取决于水分子晃动的程度，但是回到水面的分子数则大大地滅少了，因为在水面上的水分子数已极其稀少。因此逸出水面的分子比进入水面的分子多，水就蒸发了。所以，如果你要使水蒸发的话，就打开风扇吧！

这里还有另一件事情：哪些分子会离开？一个分子能离开水面是由于它偶然比通常情况稍微多积累了一些能量，这样才能使它摆脱邻近分子的吸引。结果，由于离开水面的分子带走的能量比平均能量大，留在水中的分子的运动平均起来就比先前减弱。因此液体蒸发时会逐渐冷却。当然，当一个水蒸气分子从空气中跑向水面时，它一靠近水面就要突然受到一个很强的吸引。这就使它进入水中时具有更大的速度，结果就产生热量。所以当水分子离开水面时，它们带走了热量；而当它们回到水面时，则产生了热量。当然，如果不存在净的蒸发现象的话，什么结果也不会发生 —— 水的温度并不改变。如果我们向水面上吹风，使蒸发的分子数一直占优势，水就会冷却。因此，要使汤冷却就得不停地吹！

1-2『液体蒸发会导致冷却，费曼这个视角的解释太 NB 了，做一张信息数据卡片。』—— 已完成

当然，你们应当了解，刚才所说的那个过程实际上要比我们所指出的更为复杂。不仅水分子进入空气，不时还有氧分子或氮分子跑到水里，「消失」在一大堆水分子中，这样空气就溶解在水中了：氧和氮的分子进入水中，水里就含有空气。如果我们突然从容器中抽走空气，那么空气分子出来要比进去来得快，这样就形成了气泡，你们可能知道，这对潜水员是很不利的。

现在我们来考虑另一种过程。在图 1-6 中，我们从原子的观点来看固体在水中溶解。如果我们把结晶盐粒丢入水中，会出现什么情况呢？食盐是一种固体，也是一种晶体，并且是「食盐原子」的有规则的排列，图 1-7 是普通食盐 一一 氯化钠的三维结构图。严格地说，这种晶体不是用原子而是用我们所谓的离子构成的！离子就是带有额外电子的原子，或失去些电子的原子。在食盐晶体中我们发现了氯离子（带有一个额外电子的氯原子）和钠离子（失去一个电子的钠原子）。在固态食盐中，所有的离子都由于电的作用而吸引在一起，但是当我们把食盐投到水里后，就会发现，由于带负电的氧和带正电的氢对离子的引力，有一些离子离散了。

在图 1-6 中有一个氯离子松开来了，其他的原子则以离子的形式在水中浮动。这张图画得相当仔细。例如，注意水分子中的氢原子一端大多靠近氯离子，而在钠离子周围所见到的大多是氧原子的那一端，因为钠是正的，而水的氧原子一端是负的，它们之间有电的吸引。我们能不能从这幅图画中看出盐究竟是溶解于水中，还是从水中结晶出来？

当然，我们看不出来，因为当某些原子离开晶体时，另一些原子又重新聚集到晶体上。整个过程是个动态过程，犹如同蒸发的情况，它取决于水中的盐的含量是超过还是少于形成平衡所需要的数量。所谓平衡我们指的是这种情况，即原子离开晶体的比率正好与回到晶体的比率相同。假如在水中几乎没有什么盐，离开的原子就比回去的原子多，食盐就溶解。但另一方面，如果水里的「食盐原子」太多，那么回去的就多于离开的，食盐就结晶。

我们顺便说一下，物质的分子这个概念只是近似的，而且只是对某些种类的物质才有意义。很清楚，在水的情况下，三个原子彼此确实粘在一起，但是在固体的氯化钠情况下就不那么明确了。在氯化钠中钠离子和氯离子只是以立方体的形式排列。这里没有一种把它们自然分成「食盐分子」的方式。

1『分子的概念只是近似的，这句话醍醐灌顶，解答了之前的困惑，总觉得晶体、金属这个固体物质，用「分子说」解释不通。其实「分子说」只是一种不错的模型，不需要局限于物质都是由分子构成的，是个模型就尤其局限性，目前个人的理解分子论比较适用的是液体和气体。（2021-01-18）』

现在回到我们的溶解与淀积的讨论上。如果增加食盐溶液的温度，那么原子离开的比率就会增加，而原子回来的比率也会增加。结果是一般很难预言会朝哪一个方向发展，固体溶解得多一些还是少一些。当温度提高时，大多数物质更易溶解，但是某些物质则更不易溶解。

1-2『有更正了自己的一个错误观念，温度越低溶解度越大，对于绝大部分物质是对的，但有些物质却相反，记得以后留意收集那些特例。做一张反常识卡片。』—— 已完成

### 1.4 Chemical reactions 

In all of the processes which have been described so far, the atoms and the ions have not changed partners, but of course there are circumstances in which the atoms do change combinations, forming new molecules. This is illustrated in Fig. 1-8. 

A process in which the rearrangement of the atomic partners occurs is what we call a chemical reaction. The other processes so far described are called physical processes, but there is no sharp distinction between the two. (Nature does not care what we call it, she just keeps on doing it.) This ﬁgure is supposed to represent carbon burning in oxygen. In the case of oxygen, two oxygen atoms stick together very strongly. (Why do not three or even four stick together? That is one of the very peculiar characteristics of such atomic processes. Atoms are very special: they like certain particular partners, certain particular directions, and so on. It is the job of physics to analyze why each one wants what it wants. At any rate, two oxygen atoms form, saturated and happy, a molecule.)

The carbon atoms are supposed to be in a solid crystal (which could be graphite or diamond `*`). Now, for example, one of the oxygen molecules can come over to the carbon, and each atom can pick up a carbon atom and go ﬂying oﬀ in a new combination — 「carbon-oxygen」 — which is a molecule of the gas called carbon monoxide. It is given the chemical name CO. It is very simple: the letters「CO」are practically a picture of that molecule. But carbon attracts oxygen much more than oxygen attracts oxygen or carbon attracts carbon. Therefore in this process the oxygen may arrive with only a little energy, but the oxygen and carbon will snap together with a tremendous vengeance and commotion, and everything near them will pick up the energy. A large amount of motion energy, kinetic energy, is thus generated. This of course is burning; we are getting heat from the combination of oxygen and carbon. The heat is ordinarily in the form of the molecular motion of the hot gas, but in certain circumstances it can be so enormous that it generates light. That is how one gets ﬂames. In addition, the carbon monoxide is not quite satisﬁed. It is possible for it to attach another oxygen, so that we might have a much more complicated reaction in which the oxygen is combining with the carbon, while at the same time there happens to be a collision with a carbon monoxide molecule. One oxygen atom could attach itself to the CO and ultimately form a molecule, composed of one carbon and two oxygens, which is designated CO2 and called carbon dioxide. If we burn the carbon with very little oxygen in a very rapid reaction (for example, in an automobile engine, where the explosion is so fast that there is not time for it to make carbon dioxide) a considerable amount of carbon monoxide is formed. In many such rearrangements, a very large amount of energy is released, forming explosions, ﬂames, etc., depending on the reactions. Chemists have studied these arrangements of the atoms, and found that every substance is some type of arrangement of atoms.

`*` One can burn a diamond in air.

To illustrate this idea, let us consider another example. If we go into a ﬁeld of small violets, we know what「that smell」is. It is some kind of molecule, or arrangement of atoms, that has worked its way into our noses. First of all, how did it work its way in? That is rather easy. If the smell is some kind of molecule in the air, jiggling around and being knocked every which way, it might have accidentally worked its way into the nose. Certainly it has no particular desire to get into our nose. It is merely one helpless part of a jostling crowd of molecules, and in its aimless wanderings this particular chunk of matter happens to ﬁnd itself in the nose.

Now chemists can take special molecules like the odor of violets, and analyze them and tell us the exact arrangement of the atoms in space. We know that the carbon dioxide molecule is straight and symmetrical: O — C — O. (That can be determined easily, too, by physical methods.) However, even for the vastly more complicated arrangements of atoms that there are in chemistry, one can, by a long, remarkable process of detective work, ﬁnd the arrangements of the atoms. Figure 1-9 is a picture of the air in the neighborhood of a violet; again we ﬁnd nitrogen and oxygen in the air, and water vapor. (Why is there water vapor? Because the violet is wet. All plants transpire.) However, we also see a「monster」composed of carbon atoms, hydrogen atoms, and oxygen atoms, which have picked a certain particular pattern in which to be arranged. It is a much more complicated arrangement than that of carbon dioxide; in fact, it is an enormously complicated arrangement. Unfortunately, we cannot picture all that is really known about it chemically, because the precise arrangement of all the atoms is actually known in three dimensions, while our picture is in only two dimensions. The six carbons which form a ring do not form a ﬂat ring, but a kind of「puckered」ring. All of the angles and distances are known. So a chemical formula is merely a picture of such a molecule. When the chemist writes such a thing on the blackboard, he is trying to「draw,」roughly speaking, in two dimensions. For example, we see a「ring」of six carbons, and a「chain」of carbons hanging on the end, with an oxygen second from the end, three hydrogens tied to that carbon, two carbons and three hydrogens sticking up here, etc.

Fig. 1-10. The substance pictured is α-irone.

How does the chemist ﬁnd what the arrangement is? He mixes bottles full of stuﬀ together, and if it turns red, it tells him that it consists of one hydrogen and two carbons tied on here; if it turns blue, on the other hand, that is not the way it is at all. This is one of the most fantastic pieces of detective work that has ever been done — organic chemistry. To discover the arrangement of the atoms in these enormously complicated arrays the chemist looks at what happens when he mixes two diﬀerent substances together. The physicist could never quite believe that the chemist knew what he was talking about when he described the arrangement of the atoms. For about twenty years it has been possible, in some cases, to look at such molecules (not quite as complicated as this one, but some which contain parts of it) by a physical method, and it has been possible to locate every atom, not by looking at colors, but by measuring where they are. And lo and behold, the chemists are almost always correct.

It turns out, in fact, that in the odor of violets there are three slightly diﬀerent molecules, which diﬀer only in the arrangement of the hydrogen atoms.

One problem of chemistry is to name a substance, so that we will know what it is. Find a name for this shape! Not only must the name tell the shape, but it must also tell that here is an oxygen atom, there a hydrogen — exactly what and where each atom is. So we can appreciate that the chemical names must be complex in order to be complete. You see that the name of this thing in the more complete form that will tell you the structure of it is 4-(2, 2, 3, 6 tetramethyl-5-cyclohexenyl)-3-buten-2-one, and that tells you that this is the arrangement. We can appreciate the diﬃculties that the chemists have, and also appreciate the reason for such long names. It is not that they wish to be obscure, but they have an extremely diﬃcult problem in trying to describe the molecules in words!

How do we know that there are atoms? By one of the tricks mentioned earlier: we make the hypothesis that there are atoms, and one after the other results come out the way we predict, as they ought to if things are made of atoms. There is also somewhat more direct evidence, a good example of which is the following: The atoms are so small that you cannot see them with a light microscope — in fact, not even with an electron microscope. (With a light microscope you can only see things which are much bigger.) Now if the atoms are always in motion, say in water, and we put a big ball of something in the water, a ball much bigger than the atoms, the ball will jiggle around — much as in a push ball game, where a great big ball is pushed around by a lot of people. The people are pushing in various directions, and the ball moves around the ﬁeld in an irregular fashion. So, in the same way, the「large ball」will move because of the inequalities of the collisions on one side to the other, from one moment to the next. Therefore, if we look at very tiny particles (colloids) in water through an excellent microscope, we see a perpetual jiggling of the particles, which is the result of the bombardment of the atoms. This is called the Brownian motion. We can see further evidence for atoms in the structure of crystals. In many cases the structures deduced by x-ray analysis agree in their spatial「shapes」with the forms actually exhibited by crystals as they occur in nature. The angles between the various「faces」of a crystal agree, within seconds of arc, with angles deduced on the assumption that a crystal is made of many「layers」of atoms.

Everything is made of atoms. That is the key hypothesis. The most important hypothesis in all of biology, for example, is that everything that animals do, atoms do. In other words, there is nothing that living things do that cannot be understood from the point of view that they are made of atoms acting according to the laws of physics. This was not known from the beginning: it took some experimenting and theorizing to suggest this hypothesis, but now it is accepted, and it is the most useful theory for producing new ideas in the ﬁeld of biology.

If a piece of steel or a piece of salt, consisting of atoms one next to the other, can have such interesting properties; if water — which is nothing but these little blobs, mile upon mile of the same thing over the earth — can form waves and foam, and make rushing noises and strange patterns as it runs over cement; if all of this, all the life of a stream of water, can be nothing but a pile of atoms, how much more is possible? If instead of arranging the atoms in some deﬁnite pattern, again and again repeated, on and on, or even forming little lumps of complexity like the odor of violets, we make an arrangement which is always diﬀerent from place to place, with diﬀerent kinds of atoms arranged in many ways, continually changing, not repeating, how much more marvelously is it possible that this thing might behave? Is it possible that that「thing」walking back and forth in front of you, talking to you, is a great glob of these atoms in a very complex arrangement, such that the sheer complexity of it staggers the imagination as to what it can do? When we say we are a pile of atoms, we do not mean we are merely a pile of atoms, because a pile of atoms which is not repeated from one to the other might well have the possibilities which you see before you in the mirror.

1-4 化学反应

到现在为止，在我们所描述的一切过程中，原子和离子的伙伴并没有变更，但是当然也有这种情况，原子的组合的确改变了，形成新的分子。图 1-8 就是说明这一情况的。在一个过程中如果原子的伙伴重新排列，我们就称之为化学反应。其他前面所描述的过程称为物理过程，但是二者之间并没有明显的界限。（大自然并不关心我们究竟如何去称呼，她只知道不断地进行工作。）图 1-8 表示碳在氧气中的燃烧，在氧气中，两个氧原子紧紧地吸引在一起。（为什么不是三个甚至四个吸引在一起？这是此类原子过程的一个很典型的特征。原子是非常特别的：它们喜欢一定的伙伴，一定的方向，等等。物理学的任务就是要分析每一个原子为什么想要它所希望要的东西。无论如何，两个氧原子形成了一个饱和的、适宜的分子。)

1『大自然并不关心我们究竟如何去称呼，她只知道不断地进行工作。这一句话又是醍醐灌顶，物理过程、化学过程只是人为的分类，方便我们区分概念而已，其实二者没啥明显的分界，都是那么自然而然发生着的。做一张金句卡片。』—— 已完成

这些碳原子应该处于固态晶体之中（可以是石墨，也可以是金刚石）。现在，比如说有一个氧分子跑到碳这边来，每个氧原子可以抓住一个碳原子而以一种新的组合 ——「碳-氧」—— 一起飞走，这就是所谓的一氧化碳气体分子，它的化学名称是 CO。这种气体分子很简单：字母「CO」实际上就是这个分子的一个画象。但是碳吸引氧的能力比氧吸引氧或者碳吸引碳的能力更大。因此在这个过程中氧原子可能在到达时只带有一点点能量，但是氧和碳的结合却是非常彻底而剧烈的，所有靠近它们的原子都吸收能量。于是就产生了大量的分子运动的能量 一一 动能。当然，这就是燃烧。我们从氧和碳的结合得到了热量。这种热量通常是以热气体的分子运动的形式存在的，但是在某些情况下，由于热量非常大而发出了光。这就是怎样产生火焰的过程。

此外，一氧化碳分子并不感到满足。它可能再缚住另一个氧原子，因此，可能出现远为复杂的反应：氧与碳会结合起来，同时偶而又与一氧化碳分子碰撞。于是一个氧原子可能结合到一个 CO 分子上，最终形成另一个分子，它包含一个碳原子和两个氧原子，称为二氧化碳，并以 CO2 表示。假如我们以很快的速度在很少的氧气中燃烧碳的话（例如，在汽车引擊中，爆炸是如此迅速，以致没有时间形成二氧化碳）就形成了大量的一氧化碳。在许多这种重新排列的过程中，大量的能量被释放出来，依反应条件的不同而形成爆炸、火焰等等。化学家研究了这些原子的排列情况，发现每一种物质都是某种类型的原子的排列。

为了说明这个概念，我们来考虑另一个例子。如果我们走到一个紫罗兰花圃里去，我们知道那是一种什么香气。这是某种分子或者说原子排列钻进了我们的鼻子。首先，这种分子是怎样钻进来的呢？这很容易。假如香气是飘浮在空气中的某种分子，它们就会到处晃动，四面八方地撞来撞去，很可能偶而钻进了我们的鼻子。肯定分子并不想特别进入我们的嗅觉器官。在挤成一堆的分子中，大家都无目的地到处徘徊，而碰巧有一些分子却发现自己原来已到达人的鼻子中了。

现在，化学家可以取一些像紫罗兰香气这样特殊的分子进行分析，然后告诉我们原子在空间的精确排列。我们知道二氧化碳分子的结构是简单而对称的：O-C-O（这也很容易用物理方法来确定，）然而，即使对化学中那些非常复杂的原子排列，人们也可以通过长期的、卓越的探索工作来查明其排列方式。图 1-9 是空气中紫罗兰香气图。我们再一次发现有氮、氧以及水蒸气（为什么这儿有水蒸气？因为紫罗兰是湿的。所有的植物都会蒸发水气。) 然而，我们还看到一个由碳原子、氧原子及氢原子组成的「怪物」，它也选择了一种特殊的排列形式。这种形式比二氧化碳的排列远为复杂；事实上，它是一种极为复杂的排列。遗憾的是，我们无法画出所有那些在化学上已确实知道的情况，因为所有的原子的精确排列都是三维的，而我们的画面只是二维的。六个碳原子组成了一个环，但它不是扁平的，而是一种「皱褶」的环。环的所有角度和间距都已知道，所以一个化学式只是这样的分子的一个画象。当一位化学家把它写在黑板上时，祖略地说，他是在二维空间里「画」图比如，我们见到六个碳原子组成的一个「环」，在一个端点还悬挂着一条碳「链」，链的第二个端点的碳上有一个氧原子，还有三个氢原子连在那个碳原子上，两个氢原子和三个碳原子竖在这儿，等等。

化学家是怎样发现这种排列的呢？他把几瓶东西混合起来，如果交红了，就说明，在某处有两个碳原子与一个氧原子联结在一起；如果变蓝了，就说明根本不是那么一回事。这是所做过的最奇妙的探索工作之 一一 有机化学。为了发现极其复杂的阵列中的原子排列，化学家观察两种不同的物质混合后究竟会发生什么事？当化学家描述原子的排列时，物理学家从来不怎么相信化学家了解他在谈论的是什么。大约在 20 年前就能在某些情况下用物理方法来研究这些分子的排列（不完全像我们这个分子那样复杂，只包括了它的一部分），而且能通过测量而不是观颜色来确定每个原子的位置，嗨！你瞧！化学家几乎总是正确的。

结果，实际上紫罗兰的香气里有三种略为不同的分子，其差别仅在于氢原子的排列不同。

化学的一个任务是给物质命名，从而使我们知道它是什么。给这种形状起个名字看看。这个名称不仅要表明形状，而且还要说出这里是一个氧原子，那里是一个氢原子 —— 确切地说出每个原子的名称和位置。所以我们可以设想，为了全面起见，化学名称一定是十分复杂的。你们看！这个东西的比较完整的名称是 4-(2, 2, 3, 6-四甲基-5-环己烯基)-3-丁烯-2-酮，它告诉你这样东西的结构，还告诉你这就是它的排列方式。我们可以意识到化学家所遇到的困难，也懂得这样长的命名的理由。化学家们并不想把名称搞得这样晦涩难解，但在试图用词汇来描写分子时，他们却遇到了非常棘手的问题！

我们怎么知道存在着原子呢？可以用上面提到过的一种技巧：我们假设存在着原子，而一个又一个的结果与我们的预言相符合，如果事物真是由原子组成的话，它们就应当如此。此外，也多少有点更为直接的证据，下面就是一个很好的例子。

由于原子是如此之小，你用光学显微镜观察不到它，事实上，即使用电子显微镜也不行。（用光学显微镜，你们只能看到大得多的东西。) 要是原子一直在运动，比如水中的原子，那么如果我们把某种较大的球放到水中去，这个比原子大得多的球就会晃来晃去 一一 就像玩球时，一个很大的球被许多人打来打去一样。人们向各个方向推球，结果球在场地上作不规则的运动。同样，「大球」也将运动，因为它在各方面受到的碰撞不等，在各个时刻受到的碰撞也不等。因此，如果我们用很好的显微镜观察水中很小的粒子（胶粒），就能看到微粒在不停地跳动，这是原子碰撞的结果。这种运动称为布朗运动。

1『爱因斯坦在 1905 奇迹年里发表的论文之一。（2021-01-18）』

我们在晶体结构上也可看到进一步的证据。在许多情况下，由 X 射线分析推断出的结构在空间「形状」上与自然界中的晶体实际上显示出来的形状相符合。实际晶体的各个「面」之间的夹角，与从晶体是由多「层」原子构成的假设推断出来的角度之差在秒以下。

一切都由原子构成。这就是关键性的假设。例如，在整个生物学中最重要的假设是：动物所做的每件事都是原子做的。换句话说：没有一件生物所做的事不能从这些生物是用服从物理定律的运动原子组成的这个观点来加以理解。这在开始时并没有认识到：提出这种假设需要作一些实验与推理，但现在它已被接受了，它是在生物学领域内产生新观念的最有用的理论。

如果一块由一个挨一个的原子组成的钢或盐可以具有这种有趣的性质；如果水 一一 它只不过是些小滴，地球上到处都有 —— 可以形成波浪和泡沫，这些波浪冲向水泥堤岸时会产生冲击声和奇妙的浪花；如果一流细水永远只能是一堆原子，那么还会有什么呢？假设我们不是把原子排成确定的型式，再三重复，不断反复，或者甚至形成象紫罗兰香气那样复杂的东西，而是制造出一种各处都不相同的排列：不同的原子以不同的方式配置，不断改变，从不重复，那么事情会变得更加不可思议吗？—— 那个在你面前走来走去与你薴谈的东西可能是一大群排列得非常复杂的原子吗？这个东西的彻底复杂性可能动摇你对它产生一些什么想象吗？当我们说，我们是一堆原子，这并不意味着我们只是一堆原子，当你站在镜子前，你就能在镜子里看到，一堆并非简单地一个一个重复排列的原子所组成的东西将会具有如何丰寓而生动的内容！

## 0201. Basic Physics

### 2.1 Introduction

In this chapter, we shall examine the most fundamental ideas that we have about physics — the nature of things as we see them at the present time. We shall not discuss the history of how we know that all these ideas are true; you will learn these details in due time.

The things with which we concern ourselves in science appear in myriad forms, and with a multitude of attributes. For example, if we stand on the shore and look at the sea, we see the water, the waves breaking, the foam, the sloshing motion of the water, the sound, the air, the winds and the clouds, the sun and the blue sky, and light; there is sand and there are rocks of various hardness and permanence, color and texture. There are animals and seaweed, hunger and disease, and the observer on the beach; there may be even happiness and thought. Any other spot in nature has a similar variety of things and inﬂuences. It is always as complicated as that, no matter where it is. Curiosity demands that we ask questions, that we try to put things together and try to understand this multitude of aspects as perhaps resulting from the action of a relatively small number of elemental things and forces acting in an inﬁnite variety of combinations.

For example: Is the sand other than the rocks? That is, is the sand perhaps nothing but a great number of very tiny stones? Is the moon a great rock? If we understood rocks, would we also understand the sand and the moon? Is the wind a sloshing of the air analogous to the sloshing motion of the water in the sea? What common features do diﬀerent movements have? What is common to diﬀerent kinds of sound? How many diﬀerent colors are there? And so on. In this way we try gradually to analyze all things, to put together things which at ﬁrst sight look diﬀerent, with the hope that we may be able to reduce the number of diﬀerent things and thereby understand them better.

A few hundred years ago, a method was devised to ﬁnd partial answers to such questions. Observation, reason, and experiment make up what we call the scientiﬁc method. We shall have to limit ourselves to a bare description of our basic view of what is sometimes called fundamental physics, or fundamental ideas which have arisen from the application of the scientiﬁc method. What do we mean by「understanding」something? We can imagine that this complicated array of moving things which constitutes「the world」is something like a great chess game being played by the gods, and we are observers of the game. We do not know what the rules of the game are; all we are allowed to do is to watch the playing. Of course, if we watch long enough, we may eventually catch on to a few of the rules. The rules of the game are what we mean by fundamental physics. Even if we knew every rule, however, we might not be able to understand why a particular move is made in the game, merely because it is too complicated and our minds are limited. If you play chess you must know that it is easy to learn all the rules, and yet it is often very hard to select the best move or to understand why a player moves as he does. So it is in nature, only much more so; but we may be able at least to ﬁnd all the rules. Actually, we do not have all the rules now. (Every once in a while something like castling is going on that we still do not understand.) Aside from not knowing all of the rules, what we really can explain in terms of those rules is very limited, because almost all situations are so enormously complicated that we cannot follow the plays of the game using the rules, much less tell what is going to happen next. We must, therefore, limit ourselves to the more basic question of the rules of the game. If we know the rules, we consider that we「understand」the world.

How can we tell whether the rules which we「guess」at are really right if we cannot analyze the game very well? There are, roughly speaking, three ways. 

2『补充进之前做的主题卡「验证猜测的三个方法」。（2021-01-27）』—— 已完成

First, there may be situations where nature has arranged, or we arrange nature, to be simple and to have so few parts that we can predict exactly what will happen, and thus we can check how our rules work. (In one corner of the board there may be only a few chess pieces at work, and that we can ﬁgure out exactly.) 

A second good way to check rules is in terms of less speciﬁc rules derived from them. For example, the rule on the move of a bishop on a chessboard is that it moves only on the diagonal. One can deduce, no matter how many moves may be made, that a certain bishop will always be on a red square. So, without being able to follow the details, we can always check our idea about the bishop’s motion by ﬁnding out whether it is always on a red square. Of course it will be, for a long time, until all of a sudden we ﬁnd that it is on a black square (what happened of course, is that in the meantime it was captured, another pawn crossed for queening, and it turned into a bishop on a black square). That is the way it is in physics. For a long time we will have a rule that works excellently in an over-all way, even when we cannot follow the details, and then some time we may discover a new rule. From the point of view of basic physics, the most interesting phenomena are of course in the new places, the places where the rules do not work — not the places where they do work! That is the way in which we discover new rules. 

The third way to tell whether our ideas are right is relatively crude but probably the most powerful of them all. That is, by rough approximation. While we may not be able to tell why Alekhine moves this particular piece, perhaps we can roughly understand that he is gathering his pieces around the king to protect it, more or less, since that is the sensible thing to do in the circumstances. In the same way, we can often understand nature, more or less, without being able to see what every little piece is doing, in terms of our understanding of the game. 

At ﬁrst the phenomena of nature were roughly divided into classes, like heat, electricity, mechanics, magnetism, properties of substances, chemical phenomena, light or optics, x-rays, nuclear physics, gravitation, meson phenomena, etc. However, the aim is to see complete nature as diﬀerent aspects of one set of phenomena. That is the problem in basic theoretical physics, today — to ﬁnd the laws behind experiment; to amalgamate these classes. Historically, we have always been able to amalgamate them, but as time goes on new things are found. We were amalgamating very well, when all of a sudden x-rays were found. Then we amalgamated some more, and mesons were found. Therefore, at any stage of the game, it always looks rather messy. A great deal is amalgamated, but there are always many wires or threads hanging out in all directions. That is the situation today, which we shall try to describe.

2『补充进之前做的主题卡「大统一理论」。（2021-01-27）』—— 已完成

Some historic examples of amalgamation are the following. First, take heat and mechanics. When atoms are in motion, the more motion, the more heat the system contains, and so heat and all temperature eﬀects can be represented by the laws of mechanics. Another tremendous amalgamation was the discovery of the relation between electricity, magnetism, and light, which were found to be diﬀerent aspects of the same thing, which we call today the electromagnetic ﬁeld. Another amalgamation is the uniﬁcation of chemical phenomena, the various properties of various substances, and the behavior of atomic particles, which is in the quantum mechanics of chemistry. The question is, of course, is it going to be possible to amalgamate everything, and merely discover that this world represents diﬀerent aspects of one thing?

Nobody knows. All we know is that as we go along, we ﬁnd that we can amalgamate pieces, and then we ﬁnd some pieces that do not ﬁt, and we keep trying to put the jigsaw puzzle together. Whether there are a ﬁnite number of pieces, and whether there is even a border to the puzzle, is of course unknown. It will never be known until we ﬁnish the picture, if ever. What we wish to do here is to see to what extent this amalgamation process has gone on, and what the situation is at present, in understanding basic phenomena in terms of the smallest set of principles. To express it in a simple manner, what are things made of and how few elements are there?

2-1 引言

在本章中我们将考察有关物理学的最基本观念，即我们在目前所知道的事物的本性。这里将不去论及我们如何知道所有这些观念是正确的那个认识过程，你们在适当的时候会学习到这些具体的细节。

我们在科学上所关心的事物具有无数的形式和许多属性。举例来说，假如我们站在岸边眺望大海，将会看到：这里有海水、拍击的浪花、飞溅的泡沫以及汹涌的波浪，还有太阳、光线、蔚蓝的天空、白云以及空气的流动 一一 风；在海边有沙粒，不同色纹和硬度的岩石；在海里浮游着生物，此生彼灭；最后，还有我们这些站在海岸边的观察者；甚至还有幸福和怀念。在自然界的其他场合，也同样出现种种纷繁复杂的事物和影响。无论在哪里，到处都是这样错综复杂和变化无穷。好奇心驱使我们提出问题，把事物联系起来，而将它们的种种表现理解为或许是由较少量的基本事物和相互作用以无穷多的方式组合后所产生的结果。

例如，沙粒和岩石是两回事吗？也许沙粒只不过是大量的细小石块？月亮是不是一块巨大的岩石呢？如果我们了解岩石，是否就能了解沙粒和月亮呢？风是否与海洋中的水流相类似，就是一种空气的流动？不同的运动有什么共同特征？不同的声音有什么相似之处？究竟有多少种颜色？等等。我们就是试图这样逐步分析所有的事情，把那些乍看起来似乎不相同的东西联系起来，希望有可能减少不同类事物的数目，从而能更好地理解它们。

几百年以前，人们想出了一种部分解答这类问题的方法，那就是：观察、推理和实验，这些内容构成了通常所说的科学方法。在这里，我们将只限于对那些有时称为基础物理中的基本观点，或者在科学方法的应用中形成的基本概念作一描述。

现在我们要问：所谓「理解」某种事情指的是什么意思？可以作一想象：组成这个「世界」的运动物体的复杂排列似乎有点像是天神们所下的一盘伟大的国际象棋，我们则是这盘棋的观众。我们不知道弈棋的规则，所有能做的事就是观看这场棋赛。当然，假如我们观看了足够长的时间，总归能看出几条规则来。这些弈棋规则就是我们所说的基础物理。但是，即使我们知道了每条规则，仍然可能不理解为什么下棋时要走某一步棋，这仅仅是因为情况太复杂了，而我们的智力却是有限的。如果你们会下棋，就一定知道，学会所有的规则是容易的，但要选择最好的一着棋，或者要弄懂别人为什么走这一着棋往往就很困难了。在自然界里，情况也正是如此，而且只会更难一些。但是，至少我们能发现所有的规则。实际上我们今天还没有找到所有规则（时而还会出现弈棋中「王车易位」之类的令人费解的情况）。除了我们还不知道所有的规则以外，我们真正能用已知规则来解释的事情也是非常有限的，因为几乎所有的情况都是极其复杂的，我们不能领会这盘棋中应用这些规则的走法，更无法预言下一步将要怎样。所以，我们必须使自己只限于这种游戏规则的比较基本的问题。如果我们知道了这些规则，就认为「理解」了世界。

如果我们不能很好地分析这盘象棋游戏，那么又怎样来辨别我们「猜测」出的规则实际上是否正确呢？大致地讲，可以有三种办法。

第一，可能有这种情况：大自然安排得，或者说我们将大自然安排得十分简单，只有少数几个组成部分，从而使我们能够正确地预测将要发生的事。在这种情况下，我们就能检验我们的规则是怎样起作用的（在棋盘角落里可能只有少数几个棋子在移动，所以我们能够正确地解决）。

第二种检验规则的好办法是，利用那些由已知规则推导出来的较一般性的法则来检验已知规则本身。比如，象在棋盘中移动的规则是只许走对角线，因而我们可以推断，无论象走了多少步，它总是出现在红方块里。这样，即使不能领会细节，我们也总能检验有关象的走法的概念，只要弄清楚它是否一直在红方块里。当然，在相当长的时间里，它都将如此，直到突然发现它出现在黑方块里（显然，这时发生的情况是这个象被俘获了，另一个卒走过来成为皇后，红方块的象就变成黑方块的象）。这也就是物理学中出现的情况，即使我们不能领会其中的细节，但是在相当长的时期内我们仍有在各方面都很好地起作用的规则；但是在某个时候，我们又会发现新的规则。从基本物理的观点来看，最有趣的现象当然是在那些新的场合 一一 那些已知规则行不通的场合中所出现的现象，而不是在原有规则行得通的地方发生的现象！这是我们发现新规则的一条途径。

第三种鉴别我们的观念是否正确的方法比较粗糙，但或许是所有方法中最为有效的，这就是用粗略的近似方法来加以辨别。我们可能说不出为什么阿莱克因（Alekhine）要走这步棋，但是我们或许能大致认为他或多或少地在调集一些棋子到王的周围来保护它。因为这是在这种情况下明摆着的事。同样，根据我们对这盘棋的理解，即使不能看出每一步棋的作用，也常常能对自然界多少有所理解。

2『验证猜测的三个方法，做一张主题卡片。』—— 已完成

人们首先把自然界中的现象大致分为几类，如热、电、力学、磁、物性、化学、光或光学、X 射线、核物理、引力、介子等等现象。然而，这样做的目的是将整个自然界看作是一系列现象的许多不同侧面。这就是今天基础理论物理面临的问题：发现隐匿在实验后的定律；把各类现象综合起来。在历史上，人们总能做到这一点，但随着时间的推移，新的事实发现了；我们曾经将现象综合得很好，突然，发现了射线，随后我们又融合了更多事实，但是又发现了介子。因此，在弈棋的任何一个阶段，看起来总是相当凌乱。大量事实被归并了，但总还有许多线索向一切方向延伸出去。这就是今天的状况，也就是我们将试图去描绘的现状。

历史上出现过的若干进行综合的情况有如下几个。首先，是热与力学的综合。当原子运动时，运动得越是剧烈，系统所包含的热量就越多，因此，热和所有的温度效应可以用力学定律来说明。另一个巨大的综合是发现了电、磁、光之间的联系，从而知道它们是同一个事物的不同方面，即今天我们称为电磁场的那个东西的不同表现。还有一个综合是把化学现象、各种物质的各种性质以及原子的行为统一起来，这就是量子化学的内容。

1-2『理论进行综合，这里算是了解到爱因斯坦、费曼这些物理学家，一直追求的大一统理论（终极理论），究竟是在追求啥了。大一统理论，做一张主题卡片。（2021-01-19）』—— 已完成

显然，现在的问题是：能不能继续把所有事情都综合起来，并且发现整个世界只是体现了一件事情的种种不同方面？无人知道答案如何。我们所知道的只是：这样做下去时，我们发现可以综合一些事实，随后又发觉出现了一些不能综合的事实。我们继续尝试这种拼图游戏。至于是否只有有限数量的棋子，甚至这场拼图游戏是否有底，当然不知道。除非有那么一天终于把图拼成了，否则我们就永远不会知道事情的究竟。在这里我们要做的是，看看哪种综合已进行到什么程度，在借助于最少的一组原理来理解基本现象方面，现状又是如何。简言之，事物是用什么构成的？总共存在多少基本元素？

### 2.2 Physics before 1920 

It is a little diﬃcult to begin at once with the present view, so we shall ﬁrst see how things looked in about 1920 and then take a few things out of that picture. Before 1920, our world picture was something like this: The「stage」on which the universe goes is the three-dimensional space of geometry, as described by Euclid, and things change in a medium called time. The elements on the stage are particles, for example the atoms, which have some properties. First, the property of inertia: if a particle is moving it keeps on going in the same direction unless forces act upon it. The second element, then, is forces, which were then thought to be of two varieties: First, an enormously complicated, detailed kind of interaction force which held the various atoms in diﬀerent combinations in a complicated way, which determined whether salt would dissolve faster or slower when we raise the temperature. The other force that was known was a long-range interaction — a smooth and quiet attraction — which varied inversely as the square of the distance, and was called gravitation. This law was known and was very simple. Why things remain in motion when they are moving, or why there is a law of gravitation was, of course, not known.

A description of nature is what we are concerned with here. From this point of view, then, a gas, and indeed all matter, is a myriad of moving particles. Thus many of the things we saw while standing at the seashore can immediately be connected. First the pressure: this comes from the collisions of the atoms with the walls or whatever; the drift of the atoms, if they are all moving in one direction on the average, is wind; the random internal motions are the heat. There are waves of excess density, where too many particles have collected, and so as they rush oﬀ they push up piles of particles farther out, and so on. This wave of excess density is sound. It is a tremendous achievement to be able to understand so much. Some of these things were described in the previous chapter. What kinds of particles are there? There were considered to be 92 at that time: 92 diﬀerent kinds of atoms were ultimately discovered. They had diﬀerent names associated with their chemical properties.

The next part of the problem was, what are the short-range forces? Why does carbon attract one oxygen or perhaps two oxygens, but not three oxygens? What is the machinery of interaction between atoms? Is it gravitation? The answer is no. Gravity is entirely too weak. But imagine a force analogous to gravity, varying inversely with the square of the distance, but enormously more powerful and having one diﬀerence. In gravity everything attracts everything else, but now imagine that there are two kinds of「things,」and that this new force (which is the electrical force, of course) has the property that likes repel but unlikes attract. The「thing」that carries this strong interaction is called charge. Then what do we have? Suppose that we have two unlikes that attract each other, a plus and a minus, and that they stick very close together. Suppose we have another charge some distance away. Would it feel any attraction? It would feel practically none, because if the ﬁrst two are equal in size, the attraction for the one and the repulsion for the other balance out. Therefore there is very little force at any appreciable distance. On the other hand, if we get very close with the extra charge, attraction arises, because the repulsion of likes and attraction of unlikes will tend to bring unlikes closer together and push likes farther apart. Then the repulsion will be less than the attraction. This is the reason why the atoms, which are constituted out of plus and minus electric charges, feel very little force when they are separated by appreciable distance (aside from gravity). When they come close together, they can「see inside」each other and rearrange their charges, with the result that they have a very strong interaction. The ultimate basis of an interaction between the atoms is electrical. Since this force is so enormous, all the plusses and all minuses will normally come together in as intimate a combination as they can. All things, even ourselves, are made of ﬁne-grained, enormously strongly interacting plus and minus parts, all neatly balanced out. Once in a while, by accident, we may rub oﬀ a few minuses or a few plusses (usually it is easier to rub oﬀ minuses), and in those circumstances we ﬁnd the force of electricity unbalanced, and we can then see the eﬀects of these electrical attractions. To give an idea of how much stronger electricity is than gravitation, consider two grains of sand, a millimeter across, thirty meters apart. If the force between them were not balanced, if everything attracted everything else instead of likes repelling, so that there were no cancellation, how much force would there be? There would be a force of three million tons between the two! You see, there is very, very little excess or deﬁcit of the number of negative or positive charges necessary to produce appreciable electrical eﬀects. This is, of course, the reason why you cannot see the diﬀerence between an electrically charged or uncharged thing — so few particles are involved that they hardly make a diﬀerence in the weight or size of an object.

With this picture the atoms were easier to understand. They were thought to have a「nucleus」at the center, which is positively electrically charged and very massive, and the nucleus is surrounded by a certain number of「electrons」which are very light and negatively charged. Now we go a little ahead in our story to remark that in the nucleus itself there were found two kinds of particles, protons and neutrons, almost of the same weight and very heavy. The protons are electrically charged and the neutrons are neutral. If we have an atom with six protons inside its nucleus, and this is surrounded by six electrons (the negative particles in the ordinary world of matter are all electrons, and these are very light compared with the protons and neutrons which make nuclei), this would be atom number six in the chemical table, and it is called carbon. Atom number eight is called oxygen, etc., because the chemical properties depend upon the electrons on the outside, and in fact only upon how many electrons there are. So the chemical properties of a substance depend only on a number, the number of electrons. (The whole list of elements of the chemists really could have been called 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. Instead of saying「carbon,」we could say「element six,」meaning six electrons, but of course, when the elements were ﬁrst discovered, it was not known that they could be numbered that way, and secondly, it would make everything look rather complicated. It is better to have names and symbols for these things, rather than to call everything by number.)

More was discovered about the electrical force. The natural interpretation of electrical interaction is that two objects simply attract each other: plus against minus. However, this was discovered to be an inadequate idea to represent it. A more adequate representation of the situation is to say that the existence of the positive charge, in some sense, distorts, or creates a「condition」in space, so that when we put the negative charge in, it feels a force. This potentiality for producing a force is called an electric ﬁeld. When we put an electron in an electric ﬁeld, we say it is「pulled.」We then have two rules: (a) charges make a ﬁeld, and (b) charges in ﬁelds have forces on them and move. 

The reason for this will become clear when we discuss the following phenomena: If we were to charge a body, say a comb, electrically, and then place a charged piece of paper at a distance and move the comb back and forth, the paper will respond by always pointing to the comb. If we shake it faster, it will be discovered that the paper is a little behind, there is a delay in the action. (At the ﬁrst stage, when we move the comb rather slowly, we ﬁnd a complication which is magnetism. Magnetic inﬂuences have to do with charges in relative motion, so magnetic forces and electric forces can really be attributed to one ﬁeld, as two diﬀerent aspects of exactly the same thing. A changing electric ﬁeld cannot exist without magnetism.) If we move the charged paper farther out, the delay is greater. Then an interesting thing is observed. Although the forces between two charged objects should go inversely as the square of the distance, it is found, when we shake a charge, that the inﬂuence extends very much farther out than we would guess at ﬁrst sight. That is, the eﬀect falls oﬀ more slowly than the inverse square. 

Here is an analogy: If we are in a pool of water and there is a ﬂoating cork very close by, we can move it「directly」by pushing the water with another cork. If you looked only at the two corks, all you would see would be that one moved immediately in response to the motion of the other — there is some kind of「interaction」between them. Of course, what we really do is to disturb the water; the water then disturbs the other cork. We could make up a「law」that if you pushed the water a little bit, an object close by in the water would move. If it were farther away, of course, the second cork would scarcely move, for we move the water locally. On the other hand, if we jiggle the cork a new phenomenon is involved, in which the motion of the water moves the water there, etc., and waves travel away, so that by jiggling, there is an inﬂuence very much farther out, an oscillatory inﬂuence, that cannot be understood from the direct interaction. Therefore the idea of direct interaction must be replaced with the existence of the water, or in the electrical case, with what we call the electromagnetic ﬁeld. The electromagnetic ﬁeld can carry waves; some of these waves are light, others are used in radio broadcasts, but the general name is electromagnetic waves. These oscillatory waves can have various frequencies. The only thing that is really diﬀerent from one wave to another is the frequency of oscillation. If we shake a charge back and forth more and more rapidly, and look at the eﬀects, we get a whole series of diﬀerent kinds of eﬀects, which are all uniﬁed by specifying but one number, the number of oscillations per second. The usual「pickup」that we get from electric currents in the circuits in the walls of a building have a frequency of about one hundred cycles per second. If we increase the frequency to 500 or 1000 kilocycles (1 kilocycle = 1000 cycles) per second, we are「on the air,」for this is the frequency range which is used for radio broadcasts. (Of course it has nothing to do with the air! We can have radio broadcasts without any air.) If we again increase the frequency, we come into the range that is used for FM and TV. Going still further, we use certain short waves, for example for radar. Still higher, and we do not need an instrument to「see」the stuﬀ, we can see it with the human eye. In the range of frequency from 5 × 10^14 to 10^15 cycles per second our eyes would see the oscillation of the charged comb, if we could shake it that fast, as red, blue, or violet light, depending on the frequency. Frequencies below this range are called infrared, and above it, ultraviolet. The fact that we can see in a particular frequency range makes that part of the electromagnetic spectrum no more impressive than the other parts from a physicist’s standpoint, but from a human standpoint, of course, it is more interesting. If we go up even higher in frequency, we get x-rays. X-rays are nothing but very high-frequency light. If we go still higher, we get gamma rays. These two terms, x-rays and gamma rays, are used almost synonymously. Usually electromagnetic rays coming from nuclei are called gamma rays, while those of high energy from atoms are called x-rays, but at the same frequency they are indistinguishable physically, no matter what their source. If we go to still higher frequencies, say to 10^24 cycles per second, we ﬁnd that we can make those waves artiﬁcially, for example with the synchrotron here at Caltech. We can ﬁnd electromagnetic waves with stupendously high frequencies — with even a thousand times more rapid oscillation — in the waves found in cosmic rays. These waves cannot be controlled by us.

2-2 1920 年以前的物理学

开始就从现在的观点讲起是有点困难的，所以让我们先来看一下在 1920 年左右人们是怎样看待世界的，然后再从这幅图像中挑出几件事情来。

在 1920 年以前，我们的世界图像大致是这样的：宇宙活动的「舞台」是欧几里得所描绘的三维几何空间，一切事物在被称为「时间」的一种介质里变化，舞台上的基本元素是粒子，例如原子，它们具有某些特性。首先它具有惯性：如果一个粒子正在运动，它将沿着同一方向继续运动下去，除非有力作用其上。此外，第二个基本元素就是力，当时认为共有两类力。第一类力是一种极其复杂细致的相互作用，它们以复杂的方式将各种各样的原子约束在不同的组合之中，它们决定当温度升高时食盐是溶解得快些还是慢些；另一类已知的力是一种长程的相互作用，它是与距离平方成反比而变化的平缓的吸引力，称为万有引力。这条定律已为我们所知，它是很简单的。当然，为什么物体的运动一经开始就能保持下去，或者为什么存在一条万有引力定律，我们则不清楚。

对自然的描述正是我们在这里要关心的。从这个观点出发，气体以及实际上所有的物质都是无数运动着的原子。这样我们站在海边所见到的许多东西马上可以联系起来了。首先是压力，它来自原子与壁或者某个东西的碰撞；如果原子的运动平均而言都沿着一个方向，这种原子的漂移运动就是风；而无规则的内部运动就是热。某个地方有过多的原子集结在一起时，就形成过剩密度的波，当波前进时，把成堆的原子推向更远的地方，等等。这种过剩密度的波就是声波。能够理解这么多事情，的确是惊人的成就。在前一章里我们已经说明过一些这样的事情。

粒子有哪些种类？在当时认为有 92 种。那时已发现有 92 种不同的原子，各按其化学性质而被赋予不同的名称。

其次的问题是，「短程力」是什么？为什么碳吸引一个（有时两个）而不是三个氧？原子间的相互作用的机制是什么？是万有引力吗？答案是否定的。万有引力实在太弱了。于是让我们来设想一种类似于万有引力那样的与距离平方成反比的力，不过它在强度上远远超过前者，此外还有一个差别：在重力作用下，每个物体彼此吸引，但现在我们设想有两类「东西」，而这种新的力（当然就是所谓电力）具有同类相斥而异类相吸的特性。具有这样强的作用的「东西」就称为电荷。

那么，我们会得到什么结果呢？假定我们有两个异类电荷，一正一负，并且彼此十分靠近。现在，在若干距离之外，还有另一个电荷。它会感到吸引吗？实际上它几乎不会感到什么作用，因为如果前两个电荷的大小相等，来自一个电荷的吸引被来自另一个电荷的排斥所抵消，所以，在任何可估计的距离上只有很小的一点作用力。另一方面，如果我们使第三个电荷非常靠近前两个时，就会发生吸引作用。因为同类电荷的斥力与异类电荷的引力倾向于使异类电荷靠近而使同类电荷远离。这样，排斥作用就将小于吸引作用。这就是为什么由正、负电荷组成的原子相互离开较远时只感受到很小一点作用力（重力除外），而当它们彼此靠近时，就能够互相「看到内部」而重新安排其电荷，结果产生极强的相互作用的原因。

2『看第二遍才算弄明白。假设有三个电荷 A、B、C，A 和 B 离的很近，基本可以作为一个整体 AB，那么 C 与 AB 的作用力很小的，因为 A、C 间的吸引力与 B、C 间的排斥力基本抵消了。当 C 离 AB 很近时，A、B、C 会重新组合形成一个新整体 ABC。正、负电荷组成的原子相互离开较远时只感受到很小一点作用力（重力除外），而当它们彼此靠近时，就能够互相「看到内部」而重新安排其电荷，结果产生极强的相互作用。做一张任意卡片。（2021-01-27）』—— 已完成

原子间作用力的最终基础是电的作用。由于这种力是如此巨大，以致所有正的与负的电荷通常都以尽可能紧密的方式结合在一起。所有的事物，甚至我们自己，都由极精细的和彼此强烈作用着的正、负微粒所组成，所有正的微粒与所有负的微粒正好抵消。有时，碰巧我们「擦」去了一些负电荷或正电荷（通常擦去负电荷较为容易），在这种情况下将会发现电力不再平衡，于是就能看到电的吸引作用。

为了对电力作用究竟比引力作用大多少有个概念，我们举出大小为 1mm，相距为 30m 的两粒沙子为例。假如它们之间的作用力没有抵消，每个电荷都吸引所有其他电荷而不考虑同类电荷间的斥力，那么，两颗沙粒之间的作用力会有多大呢？两者间将会产生 3×10^6 t 的力！你瞧，只要正电荷或负电荷的数目有一点点极小的过剩或欠缺，就足以产生可观的电效应。当然，这就是你们为什么不能看出带电体与非带电体之间的差别的原因 一一 所牵涉的粒子数目少得无论在物体的重量上或者形状上都很难造成什么差别。

有了这样的图像，对原子就比较容易理解了。人们认为原子的中心是一个带正电的质量甚大的「原子核」，核周围围绕着一定数量的很轻而带有负电的「电子」。让我们稍稍超前点提一下：在原子核里也发现了两类粒子 —— 质子和中子，它们的重量几乎相同，并且十分重。质子带正电，中子则呈中性。如果我们有一个原子，其核内有六个质子，从而四周环绕着六个电子（在通常的物质世界中负粒子都是电子，与组成原子核的质子和中子相比，它们是很轻的），在化学周期表上这个原子的序数是 6，名称是碳。原子序数为 8 的物质叫做氧，等等。因为化学性质取决于核外的电子，实际上它只取决于核外有多少个电子，所以一种物质的化学性质只由电子的数目所决定（化学家的全部元素的名称实际上可以用 1、2、3、4、5 等等编号来称呼）。我们可以说「元素 6」，表示六个电子，以代替「碳」这个名称。当然，在先前发现元素时，人们并不知道它们可以用这种方式来编号。此外，这又会使事情复杂化，因此，宁可对这些元素定一个名称和符号，这比用编号来称呼元素来得更好。

关于电的作用人们还发现了更多事情。对电相互作用的自然解释是，两个物体简单地互相吸引：正的吸引负的。然而后来发现用这种观点来描述电的相互作用并不妥当。更合适的描述这种情况的观点是：在某种意义上，正电荷的存在使空间的「状况」发生畸变，或者说在空间造成了一种「状况」。于是当我们将负电荷放到这个空间里后，它就会感受到一个作用力。这种产生力的潜在可能性就叫做电场。当把一个电子放入电场时，我们就说它受到「拉曳」。

于是我们就有了两条规则：1）电荷产生电场；2）电荷在电场中会受到力的作用而运动。

如果我们讨论下述现象的话，建立这两条规则的理由就清楚了：假如我们使某物体（比方说梳子）带电，然后把一张带电的纸片放在一定距离之外，当我们来回移动梳子时，纸片就会有反应，并且总是指向梳子。如果我们使梳子晃动得快些，就会发现纸片的运动有点滞后，即作用有所延迟（起先，当我们相当慢地晃动梳子时，我们发现一种错综复杂的现象，这就是磁。磁的影响与作相对运动的电荷有关，所以磁力和电的作用力实际上可以归之于一个场，就像同一件事的两个不同的方面。变化的电场不能离开磁而存在）。假如我们把纸片移得更远，滞后就更大，这时能观察到一件有趣的事：虽然两个带电体之间的作用力应当与距离平方成反比，但是我们发现，当摇动一个电荷时，电作用的影响范围要比起初所猜想的大得多。这就是说，作用的减弱要比反平方的规则来得慢。

这里有一个类比：如果我们在水池里，而在近处漂浮着一个软木塞，我们可以用另一个软木塞划水来「直接」移动那个木塞。如果现在你只注意两个软木塞，你能看到的将是一个立即响应另一个的运动 一一 在软木塞之间存在着某种「相互作用」。当然，我们实际上所做的只是搅动了水；然后水又去扰动另一个木塞。于是我们就能提出一条「定律」：如果稍微划下水，那么水中附近的物体就会移动。当然，假若第二个软木塞离得较远，则它将几乎不动，因为我们只是局部地搅动水。另一方面，假如我们晃动木塞，就会产生一个新的现象，即这部分水推动了那部分水，等等，于是波就传播开去，这样，由于晃动，就有一种波及十分远的影响和一种振荡的影响，这是无法用直接相互作用来理解的。所以那种直接作用的概念必须用水的存在来代替，或者，对于电的情形，用我们所谓的电磁场来代替。

电磁场能传送各种波，其中的一些就是光波，另一些波用在无线电广播里，但它们的总名称是电磁波。这些振荡的波可以有各种频率，一种波和另一种波之间的唯一的真正差别只是振荡的频率。假如我们越来越快地来回晃动电荷，并且注视着所产生的效应时，我们将得到一系列不同的效应，只要用一个数，即每秒钟振荡的次数，就能把这些效应统一起来。通常在我们住房墙上电路里流动的电流所产生的扰动约为 100Hz。如果我们把频率提高到 500kHz 或 1000kHz，我们就「在空气中了」`*`，因为这正是无线电广播所用的频率范围（当然，广播与空气毫无关系！没有任何空气也能进行广播）。假如再提高频率，那么就进入调频广播和电视所用的波段。再上去，我们使用一种极短的波，比如雷达所用的波。频率再增高，我们就无需用仪器来「看」这种波了，而用眼睛就能够看到它。在频率范围为 5x10^14-5×10^15 Hz 的时，只要有可能使带电的梳子晃动得这样快，我们的眼睛就能见到带电梳子的振动，像红光蓝光或紫光，视振动的频率而定。低于上述频率范围的称为红外，高于此范围的称为紫外。从物理学家的观点来看，我们能看见某种频率范围的波这个事实并不使这一部分电磁波谱比其他部分有什么更令人注意的地方，但是从人类的观点来看，这当然是更有趣的。如果我们把频率提得更高，于是就得到射线。射线不是别的，只是频率极高的光而已。如果再提高频率，就得到 γ 射线。射线与 γ 射线这两个名称在使用时几乎是同义的，通常将原子核发出的电磁射线称为 γ 射线，而从原子中发出的这种高能的电磁射线就称为射线。但是不论它们的起源如何，当频率相同时，它们在物理上是无法区别的。如果我们进到更高的频率，比如说 10^24 Hz，我们发现可以人工制造这样的波，例如用加利福尼亚理工学院的同步加速器。我们还可以在宇宙线里发现频率出奇的高的电磁波 一一 具有甚至比它还快 1000 倍的振荡，而这些波目前还不能由我们来控制。

### 2.3 Quantum physics

Having described the idea of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, and that this ﬁeld can carry waves, we soon learn that these waves actually behave in a strange way which seems very unwavelike. At higher frequencies they behave much more like particles! It is quantum mechanics, discovered just after 1920, which explains this strange behavior. 

In the years before 1920, the picture of space as a three-dimensional space, and of time as a separate thing, was changed by Einstein, ﬁrst into a combination which we call space-time, and then still further into a curved space-time to represent gravitation. So the「stage」is changed into space-time, and gravitation is presumably a modiﬁcation of space-time. Then it was also found that the rules for the motions of particles were incorrect. The mechanical rules of「inertia」and「forces」are wrong — Newton’s laws are wrong — in the world of atoms. Instead, it was discovered that things on a small scale behave nothing like things on a large scale. That is what makes physics diﬃcult — and very interesting. It is hard because the way things behave on a small scale is so「unnatural」; we have no direct experience with it. Here things behave like nothing we know of, so that it is impossible to describe this behavior in any other than analytic ways. It is diﬃcult, and takes a lot of imagination. 

Quantum mechanics has many aspects. In the ﬁrst place, the idea that a particle has a deﬁnite location and a deﬁnite speed is no longer allowed; that is wrong. To give an example of how wrong classical physics is, there is a rule in quantum mechanics that says that one cannot know both where something is and how fast it is moving. The uncertainty of the momentum and the uncertainty of the position are complementary, and the product of the two is bounded by a small constant. We can write the law like this: `ΔxΔp ≥ h/2π`, but we shall explain it in more detail later. This rule is the explanation of a very mysterious paradox: if the atoms are made out of plus and minus charges, why don’t the minus charges simply sit on top of the plus charges (they attract each other) and get so close as to completely cancel them out? Why are atoms so big? Why is the nucleus at the center with the electrons around it? It was ﬁrst thought that this was because the nucleus was so big; but no, the nucleus is very small. An atom has a diameter of about 10^-8 cm. The nucleus has a diameter of about 10^-13 cm.

If we had an atom and wished to see the nucleus, we would have to magnify it until the whole atom was the size of a large room, and then the nucleus would be a bare speck which you could just about make out with the eye, but very nearly all the weight of the atom is in that inﬁnitesimal nucleus. What keeps the electrons from simply falling in? This principle: If they were in the nucleus, we would know their position precisely, and the uncertainty principle would then require that they have a very large (but uncertain) momentum, i.e., a very large kinetic energy. With this energy they would break away from the nucleus. They make a compromise: they leave themselves a little room for this uncertainty and then jiggle with a certain amount of minimum motion in accordance with this rule. (Remember that when a crystal is cooled to absolute zero, we said that the atoms do not stop moving, they still jiggle. Why? If they stopped moving, we would know where they were and that they had zero motion, and that is against the uncertainty principle. We cannot know where they are and how fast they are moving, so they must be continually wiggling in there!)

Another most interesting change in the ideas and philosophy of science brought about by quantum mechanics is this: it is not possible to predict exactly what will happen in any circumstance. For example, it is possible to arrange an atom which is ready to emit light, and we can measure when it has emitted light by picking up a photon particle, which we shall describe shortly. We cannot, however, predict when it is going to emit the light or, with several atoms, which one is going to. You may say that this is because there are some internal「wheels」which we have not looked at closely enough. No, there are no internal wheels; nature, as we understand it today, behaves in such a way that it is fundamentally impossible to make a precise prediction of exactly what will happen in a given experiment. This is a horrible thing; in fact, philosophers have said before that one of the fundamental requisites of science is that whenever you set up the same conditions, the same thing must happen. This is simply not true, it is not a fundamental condition of science. The fact is that the same thing does not happen, that we can ﬁnd only an average, statistically, as to what happens. Nevertheless, science has not completely collapsed. Philosophers, incidentally, say a great deal about what is absolutely necessary for science, and it is always, so far as one can see, rather naive, and probably wrong. For example, some philosopher or other said it is fundamental to the scientiﬁc eﬀort that if an experiment is performed in, say, Stockholm, and then the same experiment is done in, say, Quito, the same results must occur. That is quite false. It is not necessary that science do that; it may be a fact of experience, but it is not necessary. 

For example, if one of the experiments is to look out at the sky and see the aurora borealis in Stockholm, you do not see it in Quito; that is a diﬀerent phenomenon.「But,」you say,「that is something that has to do with the outside; can you close yourself up in a box in Stockholm and pull down the shade and get any diﬀerence?」Surely. If we take a pendulum on a universal joint, and pull it out and let go, then the pendulum will swing almost in a plane, but not quite. Slowly the plane keeps changing in Stockholm, but not in Quito. The blinds are down, too. The fact that this happened does not bring on the destruction of science. What is the fundamental hypothesis of science, the fundamental philosophy? We stated it in the ﬁrst chapter: the sole test of the validity of any idea is experiment. If it turns out that most experiments work out the same in Quito as they do in Stockholm, then those「most experiments」will be used to formulate some general law, and those experiments which do not come out the same we will say were a result of the environment near Stockholm. We will invent some way to summarize the results of the experiment, and we do not have to be told ahead of time what this way will look like. If we are told that the same experiment will always produce the same result, that is all very well, but if when we try it, it does not, then it does not. We just have to take what we see, and then formulate all the rest of our ideas in terms of our actual experience. Returning again to quantum mechanics and fundamental physics, we cannot go into details of the quantum-mechanical principles at this time, of course, because these are rather diﬃcult to understand. We shall assume that they are there, and go on to describe what some of the consequences are. One of the consequences is that things which we used to consider as waves also behave like particles, and particles behave like waves; in fact everything behaves the same way. There is no distinction between a wave and a particle. So quantum mechanics uniﬁes the idea of the ﬁeld and its waves, and the particles, all into one. Now it is true that when the frequency is low, the ﬁeld aspect of the phenomenon is more evident, or more useful as an approximate description in terms of everyday experiences. But as the frequency increases, the particle aspects of the phenomenon become more evident with the equipment with which we usually make the measurements. In fact, although we mentioned many frequencies, no phenomenon directly involving a frequency has yet been detected above approximately 10^12 cycles per second. We only deduce the higher frequencies from the energy of the particles, by a rule which assumes that the particle-wave idea of quantum mechanics is valid. Thus we have a new view of electromagnetic interaction. We have a new kind of particle to add to the electron, the proton, and the neutron. That new particle is called a photon. The new view of the interaction of electrons and photons that is electromagnetic theory, but with everything quantum-mechanically correct, is called quantum electrodynamics. This fundamental theory of the interaction of light and matter, or electric ﬁeld and charges, is our greatest success so far in physics. In this one theory we have the basic rules for all ordinary phenomena except for gravitation and nuclear processes. For example, out of quantum electrodynamics come all known electrical, mechanical, and chemical laws: the laws for the collision of billiard balls, the motions of wires in magnetic ﬁelds, the speciﬁc heat of carbon monoxide, the color of neon signs, the density of salt, and the reactions of hydrogen and oxygen to make water are all consequences of this one law. All these details can be worked out if the situation is simple enough for us to make an approximation, which is almost never, but often we can understand more or less what is happening. At the present time no exceptions are found to the quantum-electrodynamic laws outside the nucleus, and there we do not know whether there is an exception because we simply do not know what is going on in the nucleus.

In principle, then, quantum electrodynamics is the theory of all chemistry, and of life, if life is ultimately reduced to chemistry and therefore just to physics because chemistry is already reduced (the part of physics which is involved in chemistry being already known). Furthermore, the same quantum electrodynamics, this great thing, predicts a lot of new things. In the ﬁrst place, it tells the properties of very high-energy photons, gamma rays, etc. It predicted another very remarkable thing: besides the electron, there should be another particle of the same mass, but of opposite charge, called a positron, and these two, coming together, could annihilate each other with the emission of light or gamma rays. (After all, light and gamma rays are all the same, they are just diﬀerent points on a frequency scale.) The generalization of this, that for each particle there is an antiparticle, turns out to be true. In the case of electrons, the antiparticle has another name — it is called a positron, but for most other particles, it is called anti-so-and-so, like antiproton or antineutron. In quantum electrodynamics, two numbers are put in and most of the other numbers in the world are supposed to come out. The two numbers that are put in are called the mass of the electron and the charge of the electron. Actually, that is not quite true, for we have a whole set of numbers for chemistry which tells how heavy the nuclei are. That leads us to the next part.

2-3 量子物理学

说明了电磁场概念和电磁场能传送波后，我们很快就认识到，这些波的行为实际上十分奇怪，看起来完全不像波。在频率较高时它们的行为更像粒子！正是在 1920 年后发展起来的量子力学解释了这种奇怪的行为。在 1920 年之前，爱因斯坦就已改变了把空间看作是三维空间，把时间看成单独存在的这种图像。他首先把它们组合在一起，并且称之为时空，然后又进一步用弯曲的时空来描绘万有引力，这样，「舞台」就变为时空，而万有引力则大概是时空的一种调整。以后，人们又发现有关原子运动的规则也是有问题的：在原子世界中，「惯性」与「力」的力学法则是不正确的 一一 牛顿定律已不再成立。人们发现小尺度范围内事物的行为与大尺度范围内事物的行为没有任何相似之处。这给物理学造成困难 —— 但又十分有趣。之所以困难，是由于事物在小尺度范围内的表现如此「反常」，我们对之没有直接的经验。在这里，事物的表现完全不像我们所知道的任何事情，因而除了用解析的方式，用任何其他方法都不可能描写这种特性。这的确是困难的，需要作大量的想象。

量子力学有许多观点。

首先，一个粒子既有确定的位置也有确定的速度这种概念已被抛弃，那是不正确的想法。表明经典物理是怎样不正确的一个例子是，在量子力学中有这样条定则：不可能既知道某个粒子在什么地方，又知道它运动得多快。动量的不确定性与位置的不确定性是并协的，两者的乘积是常数。我们可以把这条定律写成 `ΔxΔp ≥ h/2π`，在以后将会更详尽地解释它。这条定则解释了这样一个十分神秘的佯谬：如果原子是由正负电荷所构成，那么为什么负电荷不是简单地位于正电荷的顶端（它们彼此是吸引的），从而彼此靠拢以至于完全抵消？为什么原子这么大？为什么原子核在中心，而其周围环绕着一些电子？起先曾认为原子核很大，但事实并非如此，它是非常小的。一个原子的直径约为 10^-8cm，一个原子核的直径约为 10^-13cm。如果我们有一个原子，为了看到原子核，就要把整个原子放大到一个大房间那样大，这时原子核才是一个刚刚可以用眼晴分辨出来的斑点，但是原子的几乎所有重量都集中在这个无比小的原子核上。是什么原因使电子没有直接落入原子核呢？正是由于上述的原理。如果电子在原子核里出现，我们就会精确地知道它们的位置，而不确定性原理则要求它们具有很大的（不过是不确定的）动量，即很大的动能。电子具有这样大的能量就要脱离原子核。然而这些电子作出了让步：由于不确定性，它们为自己留下一个狭小的空间，于是以由这个定则所决定的最小的运动晃动着（记得我们曾经说过，当晶体冷却到绝对零度时，原子并没有停止运动，它们仍然在晃动，为什么？如果它们停止运动，我们就能知道它们在什么地方，而且它们不运动，这就违反了不确定性原理：我们不能既知道它们在哪里，又知道它们以什么速度运动，所以它们必须在那里不断地摆动）。

另一个由量子力学带来的在科学的观念和哲学方面最有趣的变化是，在任何情形下要精确地预言会发生什么事都是不可能的。比如我们有可能使一个原子处于准备发光的状态，在原子发光时，可以利用探测光子的方法进行测量（这一点我们马上就要讲的），但是，我们无法预计它将在什么时侯发光，或者在有几个原子的情况下，究竟哪一个原子将发光。你们可能说，这是由于某种我们还没有足够仔细观察过的内部「转轮」在起作用。然而，这里根本没有什么内部的转轮。按照我们今天的理解，大自然的表现是这样的：根本不可能精确地预言在一定的实验中究竟会发生什么事情，这是一件糟透了的事。事实上，哲学家曾经声称科学所必需的基本东西之一就是，每当你安排了同样的条件时，那么发生的必定是同一件事。但是，这完全不正确，它并不是科学的基本条件。事实是所发生的并不是同一件事，我们所能得到的只是发生一些什么的统计平均。不过，科学并没有完全崩溃。顺便说一下，哲学家们讲了一大套科学之绝对必需是什么，但就像人们所能看到的那样，这些总是相当天真的，甚至还是错误的。

例如，某个哲学家宣称，对科学的成就来说十分重要的是，如果同个实验先在某处（比如说在斯德哥尔摩）做，然后在另一处（比如说在基多）做，那么必定会出现同样的结果。完全错了。对科学来说，这并不是必然的。它可能是一个经验事实，但并不是必然的情况。比如有一个实验是在斯德哥尔摩观察天空，这时会看到北极光，如果在基多则看不到这种现象，这就是出现了不同的情况。「但是」，你会说：「这是一件与外部情况有关的事，如果你把自己关在斯德哥尔摩的一个房间里，拉下窗帘的话，那么会发现什么差别吗？」肯定会。假如我们在一个万向接头上挂一个摆，让它开始摆动，它就会差不多在一个平面里摆动，但也并不完全如此。在斯德哥尔摩，平面会缓慢地转动着。但是在基多就不会。在那里，窗帘也是垂下的。这件事的发生并没有引起科学的毁灭。科学的基本假设，它的基本哲学观念是什么呢？我们在第 1 章里讲到过：实验是任何观念的正确性的唯一试金石。假如结果是在基多所做的大多数实验与在斯德哥尔摩所做的实验效果一样，那么这「大多数实验」就可用来提出某种一般性的定律，至于对那些效果不同的实验我们就将说：「这是由于斯德哥尔摩周围的环境不同所引起的。」我们将能想出一些办法来概括实验结果，而没有必要在事先就被告诚说，这些办法看起来像什么。假如有人告诉我们说，同样的实验总是产生同样的结果，这固然很好。但是当我们试了一下后，发现并非如此，因而结论的确就是并非如此。我们正是必须相信自己所看到的，然后才能借助于实际的经验来形成我们的一切其他观念。

现在让我们回到量子力学和基本物理上来。当然，我们在此刻还不能详细叙述量子力学的原理，因为它们是颇难理解的。我们将假定它们成立，然后叙述一下某些结果。其中一个是，我们通常视作为波的那些事物也具有粒子的特性，而粒子则具有波的特性。实际上每一种事物的行为都是一样的，不存在波和粒子的区别。这样，量子力学就将场的概念与场的波与粒子统一起来。的确，频率低时，现象的场的特性比较明显，或者说作为日常经验的近似描写时比较有用。但当频率增加时，现象的粒子特性对于我们通常用来作测量用的仪器来说更为明显。实际上，虽然我们提到过许多频率，但目前还没有探测到任何直接涉及频率在 10^12Hz 以上的现象，我们只是在假定了量子力学的波粒二象性概念是正确的之后，根据有关规则从粒子的能量来推断出这些较高的频率的。

于是，我们对电磁相互作用有了新的见解。我们把一种新类型的粒子加入到电子、质子及中子的行列，这种新的粒子称为光子。而这种电子与质子相互作用的新的见解被称为量子电动力学，它就是电磁理论，不过其中的一切在量子力学上都是正确的。这是光和物质，或电场与电荷之间相互作用的基本理论，就物理学来说它是我们最伟大的成就。在这个理论中，我们得到了除万有引力与原子核过程之外的所有一般现象的根本规则。比如，从量子电动力学可以得出所有已知的电学、力学和化学定律：弹子碰撞的定律、导线在磁场中运动的定律、一氧化碳的比热、霓虹灯的色彩、盐的密度、以及氢与氧形成水的反应等全都是这理论的推论。所有这些细节，如果简单到能使我们运用近似方法的话，都可以得出，这实际上当然不可能，不过我们总能对发生的事多少有所理解。目前，在原子核外面还没有发现量子电动力学定律有什么例外，对于原子核我们不知道是否会有例外，因为对于核内的过程我们简直还不太清楚。

2『量子动力学，即电磁学，是除万有引力和原子核过程外的所有一般现象的根本规则，做一张主题卡片。』—— 已完成

这样，在原则上，量子电动力学是一切化学以及生命的理论 一一 如果生命最后归结为化学，因而也就归结为物理的话（因为化学本身已经归结为物理，涉及化学中的那部分物理早就知道了）。不仅如此，量子电动力学这个伟大的理论还预言了许多新的事实。首先，它说明了甚高能光子、射线等的性质。它还预言了另一个十分出乎意外的事：除电子外，还应当有同样质量、但带有正电荷的称为正电子的粒子，并且这两种粒子碰在一起时，会彼此湮没而放出光或 γ 射线（其实，光与 γ 射线完全是一回事，只是频率不同而已）。这件事情的推广 —— 即对每个粒子总有一个反粒子 —— 现在知道是正确的。电子的反粒子有另一个名称，即正电子，但其他大多数反粒子，就称反某某子，如反质子、反中子。在量子电动力学中提出了两个基本数据 一一 电子质量与电荷，所有世界上其他的数被认为可以从这两个数据推导出来。实际上，这不完全正确，因为化学还有一整套数据，它告诉我们原子核是多重，这就把我们引导到下一部分内容中去了。

### 2.4 Nuclei and particles

What are the nuclei made of, and how are they held together? It is found that the nuclei are held together by enormous forces. When these are released, the energy released is tremendous compared with chemical energy, in the same ratio as the atomic bomb explosion is to a TNT explosion, because, of course, the atomic bomb has to do with changes inside the nucleus, while the explosion of TNT has to do with the changes of the electrons on the outside of the atoms. The question is, what are the forces which hold the protons and neutrons together in the nucleus? Just as the electrical interaction can be connected to a particle, a photon, Yukawa suggested that the forces between neutrons and protons also have a ﬁeld of some kind, and that when this ﬁeld jiggles it behaves like a particle. Thus there could be some other particles in the world besides protons and neutrons, and he was able to deduce the properties of these particles from the already known characteristics of nuclear forces. For example, he predicted they should have a mass of two or three hundred times that of an electron; and lo and behold, in cosmic rays there was discovered a particle of the right mass! But it later turned out to be the wrong particle. It was called a µ-meson, or muon. However, a little while later, in 1947 or 1948, another particle was found, the π-meson, or pion, which satisﬁed Yukawa’s criterion. Besides the proton and the neutron, then, in order to get nuclear forces we must add the pion. Now, you say,「Oh great!, with this theory we make quantum nucleodynamics using the pions just like Yukawa wanted to do, and see if it works, and everything will be explained.」Bad luck. It turns out that the calculations that are involved in this theory are so diﬃcult that no one has ever been able to ﬁgure out what the consequences of the theory are, or to check it against experiment, and this has been going on now for almost twenty years!

So we are stuck with a theory, and we do not know whether it is right or wrong, but we do know that it is a little wrong, or at least incomplete. While we have been dawdling around theoretically, trying to calculate the consequences of this theory, the experimentalists have been discovering some things. 

For example, they had already discovered this µ-meson or muon, and we do not yet know where it ﬁts. Also, in cosmic rays, a large number of other「extra」particles were found. It turns out that today we have approximately thirty particles, and it is very diﬃcult to understand the relationships of all these particles, and what nature wants them for, or what the connections are from one to another. We do not today understand these various particles as diﬀerent aspects of the same thing, and the fact that we have so many unconnected particles is a representation of the fact that we have so much unconnected information without a good theory. After the great successes of quantum electrodynamics, there is a certain amount of knowledge of nuclear physics which is rough knowledge, sort of half experience and half theory, assuming a type of force between protons and neutrons and seeing what will happen, but not really understanding where the force comes from. Aside from that, we have made very little progress. We have collected an enormous number of chemical elements. In the chemical case, there suddenly appeared a relationship among these elements which was unexpected, and which is embodied in the periodic table of Mendeleev. For example, sodium and potassium are about the same in their chemical properties and are found in the same column in the Mendeleev chart. We have been seeking a Mendeleev-type chart for the new particles. One such chart of the new particles was made independently by Gell-Mann in the U.S.A. and Nishijima in Japan. The basis of their classiﬁcation is a new number, like the electric charge, which can be assigned to each particle, called its「strangeness,」S. This number is conserved, like the electric charge, in reactions which take place by nuclear forces. In Table 2-2 are listed all the particles. We cannot discuss them much at this stage, but the table will at least show you how much we do not know. Underneath each particle its mass is given in a certain unit, called the MeV. One MeV is equal to 1.783 × 10^−27 gram. The reason this unit was chosen is historical, and we shall not go into it now. More massive particles are put higher up on the chart; we see that a neutron and a proton have almost the same mass. In vertical columns we have put the particles with the same electrical charge, all neutral objects in one column, all positively charged ones to the right of this one, and all negatively charged objects to the left.

Particles are shown with a solid line and「resonances」with a dashed one. Several particles have been omitted from the table. These include the important zero-mass, zero-charge particles, the photon and the graviton, which do not fall into the baryon-meson-lepton classiﬁcation scheme, and also some of the newer resonances (K∗, φ, η). The antiparticles of the mesons are listed in the table, but the antiparticles of the leptons and baryons would have to be listed in another table which would look exactly like this one reﬂected on the zero-charge column. Although all of the particles except the electron, neutrino, photon, graviton, and proton are unstable, decay products have been shown only for the resonances. Strangeness assignments are not applicable for leptons, since they do not interact strongly with nuclei.

Table 2-2 Elementary Particles

All particles which are together with the neutrons and protons are called baryons, and the following ones exist: There is a「lambda,」with a mass of 1115 MeV, and three others, called sigmas, minus, neutral, and plus, with several masses almost the same. There are groups or multiplets with almost the same mass, within one or two percent. Each particle in a multiplet has the same strangeness. The ﬁrst multiplet is the proton-neutron doublet, and then there is a singlet (the lambda) then the sigma triplet, and ﬁnally the xi doublet. Very recently, in 1961, even a few more particles were found. Or are they particles? They live so short a time, they disintegrate almost instantaneously, as soon as they are formed, that we do not know whether they should be considered as new particles, or some kind of「resonance」interaction of a certain deﬁnite energy between the Λ and π products into which they disintegrate. In addition to the baryons the other particles which are involved in the nuclear interaction are called mesons. There are ﬁrst the pions, which come in three varieties, positive, negative, and neutral; they form another multiplet. We have also found some new things called K-mesons, and they occur as a doublet, K+ and K0. Also, every particle has its antiparticle, unless a particle is its own antiparticle. For example, the π− and the π+ are antiparticles, but the π0 is its own antiparticle. The K− and K+ are antiparticles, and the K0 and K0. In addition, in 1961 we also found some more mesons or maybe mesons which disintegrate almost immediately. A thing called ω which goes into three pions has a mass 780 on this scale, and somewhat less certain is an object which disintegrates into two pions. These particles, called mesons and baryons, and the antiparticles of the mesons are on the same chart, but the antiparticles of the baryons must be put on another chart,「reﬂected」through the charge-zero column.

Just as Mendeleev’s chart was very good, except for the fact that there were a number of rare earth elements which were hanging out loose from it, so we have a number of things hanging out loose from this chart — particles which do not interact strongly in nuclei, have nothing to do with a nuclear interaction, and do not have a strong interaction (I mean the powerful kind of interaction of nuclear energy). These are called leptons, and they are the following: there is the electron, which has a very small mass on this scale, only 0.510 MeV. Then there is that other, the µ-meson, the muon, which has a mass much higher, 206 times as heavy as an electron. So far as we can tell, by all experiments so far, the diﬀerence between the electron and the muon is nothing but the mass. Everything works exactly the same for the muon as for the electron, except that one is heavier than the other. Why is there another one heavier; what is the use for it? We do not know. In addition, there is a lepton which is neutral, called a neutrino, and this particle has zero mass. In fact, it is now known that there are two diﬀerent kinds of neutrinos, one related to electrons and the other related to muons.

Finally, we have two other particles which do not interact strongly with the nuclear ones: one is a photon, and perhaps, if the ﬁeld of gravity also has a quantum-mechanical analog (a quantum theory of gravitation has not yet been worked out), then there will be a particle, a graviton, which will have zero mass. What is this「zero mass」? The masses given here are the masses of the particles at rest. The fact that a particle has zero mass means, in a way, that it cannot be at rest. A photon is never at rest, it is always moving at 186,000 miles a second. We will understand more what mass means when we understand the theory of relativity, which will come in due time.

Thus we are confronted with a large number of particles, which together seem to be the fundamental constituents of matter. Fortunately, these particles are not all diﬀerent in their interactions with one another. In fact, there seem to be just four kinds of interaction between particles which, in the order of decreasing strength, are the nuclear force, electrical interactions, the beta-decay interaction, and gravity. The photon is coupled to all charged particles and the strength of the interaction is measured by some number, which is 1/137. The detailed law of this coupling is known, that is quantum electrodynamics. Gravity is coupled to all energy, but its coupling is extremely weak, much weaker than that of electricity. This law is also known. Then there are the so-called weak decays — beta decay, which causes the neutron to disintegrate into proton, electron, and neutrino, relatively slowly. This law is only partly known. The so-called strong interaction, the meson-baryon interaction, has a strength of 1 in this scale, and the law is completely unknown, although there are a number of known rules, such as that the number of baryons does not change in any reaction.

Table 2-3. Elementary Interactions

| Coupling | Strength`*` | Law |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Photon to charged particles  | ~10^−2 | Law known |
| Gravity to all energy | ~10^−40 | Law known |
|  Weak decays | ~10^−5 | Law partly known |
| Mesons to baryons  | ~1 | Law unknown (some rules known)  |

`*` The「strength」is a dimensionless measure of the coupling constant involved in each interaction (∼ means「of the order」).

This then, is the horrible condition of our physics today. To summarize it, I would say this: outside the nucleus, we seem to know all; inside it, quantum mechanics is valid — the principles of quantum mechanics have not been found to fail. The stage on which we put all of our knowledge, we would say, is relativistic space-time; perhaps gravity is involved in space-time. We do not know how the universe got started, and we have never made experiments which check our ideas of space and time accurately, below some tiny distance, so we only know that our ideas work above that distance. We should also add that the rules of the game are the quantum-mechanical principles, and those principles apply, so far as we can tell, to the new particles as well as to the old. The origin of the forces in nuclei leads us to new particles, but unfortunately they appear in great profusion and we lack a complete understanding of their interrelationship, although we already know that there are some very surprising relationships among them. We seem gradually to be groping toward an understanding of the world of subatomic particles, but we really do not know how far we have yet to go in this task.

2-4 原子核与粒子

原子核是由什么组成的，这些东西又是怎样结合在一起的？人们发现，原子核是靠巨大的作用力结合在一起的，当这种力释放时，其放出来的能量比化学能大得多，前者与后者之比就好像原子弹爆炸与 TNT 炸药的爆炸相比一样。当然，这是因为原子弹爆炸时与原子核里的变化有关，而 TNT 的爆炸则与原子外层的电子变化有关。问题是，究竟是什么力使原子核中的质子与中子结合在一起呢？汤川秀树提出，就好像电相互作用可以与一种粒子 —— 光子联系起来一样，中子与质子之间的作用力也有某种场，当这个场晃动时，就好像个粒子一样。所以除去中子与质子外，在世界上应当有一些别的粒子，而汤川能从已知的核力特征推导出这些粒子的性质。比如，他预言它们应当有二三百个电子那样大的质量。你瞧！在宇宙间竟然真的发现了这样质量的粒子！但是，后来发现这并不正是预言的粒子它被称为 μ 子。

然而，没有过多少时候，在 1947 年或 1948 年就发现了另一个粒子 —— π 介子，它满足汤川的判据。这样，除去质子与中子外，为了得到核力，我们还必须加上介子。你可能会说，「太好了！借助这个理论就可以像汤川所希望的那样建立起利用 π 介子的量子核动力学，然后看看它是否成立。如果成立的话，那么每件事都可得到解释了。」不幸的是，包含在这种理论中的计算是如此困难，以至于一直到今天，已将近 20 年了，从来还没有一个人能够从这个理论中得出什么结果来，或者能够用实验去验证一下。

2『那么现在有论证么？可以去找找相关的信息。（2021-01-20）』—— 已完成

所以我们被这个理论难住了，我们不知道它究竟是正确的还是错误的，但却知道它有点小小的错误，或者至少是不完全的。正当我们在理论上徘徊并且试图用这个理论计算出结果时，实验物理学家发现了一些事情。比如，他们早已发现了 μ 子，而我们却还不知道把它归到哪里去。而且，在宇宙线里，还发现了大量的其他「额外」粒子。

今天，我们已发现了大约 30 种粒子。理解所有这些粒子的相互关系是非常困难的 一一 大自然要它们来干什么？这一个粒子与另一个粒子之间的联系是什么？我们今天并没有把这些不同的粒子理解为同一件事情的不同的方面。我们有这么多相互无关的粒子这件事本身就表明，我们还没有一个能够说明这么多相互无关的信息的良好理论。由于量子电动力学的伟大成功，我们具备了一定的核物理知识，它是一种粗糙的半经验半理论的知识，假设一种质子与中子间的力的类型，然后看看会发生什么事情，但是并不确切知道力的来源。除此以外，我们很少取得进展。在化学上，人们曾搜集大量的化学元素，以后突然在元素之间显现出一种没有预期到的关系，它就体现在门捷列夫元素周期表中。比如，钠和钾的化学性质几乎是相同的，它们就在周期表的同一行里。对于新粒子而言，我们一直也在探索着这种门捷列夫式的表。有张这样的新粒子表是由美国的盖尔曼与日本的西岛各自独立做出的。他们分类的基础是一个新的数，类似于电子的电荷，这种新的数叫做「奇异数」S，对每个粒子都指定了这样数，它像电荷一样是守恒的，即在核力的反应中保持不变。

表 2-2 列出了所有的粒子。眼下我们对之还无法讨论得更多。但是这张表至少向你们表明我们不知道的东西有多少。每个粒子下写着它的质量，其单位是兆电子伏（MeV）。1MeV 等于 1.782x10^-27g。选取这种单位的理由是出自历史的原因，我们现在不去说它。质量大的粒子在表中放在较高的位置。可以看到，中子与质子的质量是差不多相同的，在垂直的列内放置有同样电荷的粒子，所有的中性粒子都放在同一列内，所有带正电的粒子在这一列的右边，所有带负电的粒子则在左边

表 2-2 基本粒子

表 2-2 中实线标出的是粒子，虚线标明的是「共振态」。表中略去了几个粒子，包括重要的零质量、零电荷的粒子，即光子与引力子，它们并不属于「重子-介子-轻子」分类图。此外，还有某些较新的共振态（K, φ, β）也不包括在这里。介子的反粒子已列在本表内，但轻子与重子的反粒子就需要另列一张表了，它看起来正好是目前这张表对零电荷列的反演。虽然除去电子、中微子、光子、引力子和质子外，所有的粒子都是不稳定的，但是在这里只列出了共振态的衰变产物。奇异数并不适用于轻子，因为它们与核之间并没有强作用。

所有与中子、质子放在一起的粒子统称为重子。共存在着以下几种：A 介子，质量为 1154 MeV。另外还有三个：XX 介子、XX 介子和 XX 介子，质量是相近的。这里还有成群或者说成多重态的粒子，带有差不多相同的质量，相差不到 1% 或 2%。在多重态内的每个粒子都有同样的奇异数。第一个多重态是质子-中子二重态，以后是单重态（A 介子），再以后是三重态，最后是二重态。最近，在 1961 年，又发现少数几个粒子，但它们都是粒子吗？它们的寿命是如此短暂，当刚形成时，几乎就立刻蜕变了，所以我们不知道它们究竟应被认为是新的粒子，还是在它们蜕变成 XX 介子及 π 介子时后两者之间某种确定能量的「共振」作用呢？

除去重子外，其他包括在核内相互作用中的粒子称为介子。首先是 π 介子，有三种形态：正、负及中性，它们组成了另一多重态。我们还发现一些新的称为 K 介子的粒子，它们作为 K 及 K 而出现。其次，每个粒子都有反粒子，除非一个粒子是它自己的反粒子。例如 π+ 和 π- 是一对反粒子，但是 π0 是它自己的反粒子；K- 及 K+ 是反粒子对，K0 及 K-0 也是反粒子对。附带说一下，在 1961 年我们又发现了一些介子或可能的介子，它们几乎即刻就蜕变了，有一个称为 ω 的东西带有 780MeV 的质量，分解为三个 π 介子，有一个还不怎么确定的东西分解为两个 π 介子。那些被称为介子与重子的粒子与介子的反粒子放在同一张表里，但重子的反粒子必须放到另一张通过零电荷列「反射」而来的表里去。

门捷列夫周期表是很完美的，除去有一些稀土元素挂在外面。同样，这里也有一些粒子在表外，它们在核内的相互作用不强，跟核相互作用根本无关，跟核之间也没有强相互作用（我们所指的是那种强的核能相互作用）。它们被称为轻子，主要有如下几种：电子，其质量很小，只有 0.510MeV；然后是 μ 子，质量约为电子的 206 倍。根据所有的实验，我们今天所能说的电子与 μ 子之间的差别仅仅是质量不同而已，除了 μ 子比电子重外，两者在其他方面都完全一样。为什么一个比另一个重？μ 子有什么用？我们不知道。此外，有一种轻子是中性的，叫做中微子，具有零质量，事实上，现在知道有两类中微子，一类与电子有关，另一类与 μ 子有关。

最后，还有两种与核内其他粒子间没有强作用的粒子：一个是光子，另一个（或许）是具有零质量的引力子 —— 假如引力场也有类似量子力学的原理的话（引力的量子化理论还没有建立）。

什么是「零质量」？这里所标示的质量是粒子在静止时的质量。事实上，一个粒子具有零质量在某种程度上就意味着它不可能静止。光子是永远不会静止的，它一直以 186000mi/s（即 300000km/s) 的速度运动。当我们在适当的时候学习了相对论的内容后，对于质量就会理解得更多一些。

1『相对论里，质量是随着速度变化的。（2021-02-08）』

这样，我们就面对着一大群粒子，它们看来都是物质的基本组成部分。幸运的是，这些粒子彼此之间的相互作用并不全都是不同的。事实上，粒子之间的相互作用看来可以分为四类，按强度降低的顺序排列时，它们就是：核力、电相互作用、β 衰变作用以及引力。光子与所有带电粒子会发生耦合，作用的强度用某个数（1/137) 来度量。这种耦合的详细定律已经知道，那就是量子电动力学。引力和所有的能量发生耦合，但它的耦合是非常弱的，远远小于电的作用，这条定律也已经知道了。然后，还存在着所谓的弱衰变 —— β 衰变，它使中子蜕变为质子、电子及中微子，其过程是比较慢的，这种作用的定律只是部分地知道。还有所谓的强相互作用 —— 介子-重子相互作用，其强度为 1，它的规律完全不知道，虽然已经知道几条法则，比如重子的数目在任何反应中都不改变。

2『四类基本相互作用，做一张信息数据卡片。』—— 已完成

表 2-3 基本相关作用力

| 耦合关系 | 强度`*` | 定律 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 光子对带电粒子 | ≈10^-2 | 已知 |
| 引力对所有其他能量 | ≈10^-40 | 已知 |
| 弱衰变 | ≈10^-5 | 部分已知 |
| 介子对重子 | 1 | 不知（部分法则已知） |

这些就是当代物理学的惊人的状况。总结一下，我可以这样说：在核外，看来一切都知道了；在核内，量子力学是正确的，还没有发现量子力学原理失效的情况。可以说：容纳我们所有知识的舞台是相对论性时空；也许引力也包括在时空之中。我们不知道，宇宙是怎样开始的，我们从来没有做过实验来精确地检査在某个微小距离下的时空观念，所以只知道在那个距离以上我们的时空观念行得通。我们还应当补充说：这个伟大的国际象棋赛的规则就是量子力学的原理，到现在为止我们可以说，这些原则应用于新的粒子时与应用于过去已发现的粒子一样成功。核力的起源将我们引向新的粒子，但是遗憾的是出现的粒子实在太多，以至于使我们感到迷惑不解。虽然我们已经知道在它们之间存在着一些非常出人意外的关系，但对它们的相互关系缺乏完整的理解。看来我们正摸索着前进，逐渐趋近于对亚原子粒子世界的理解；但是，我们实在不清楚，在这种摸索中我们还必须走多远。

## 0301. The Relation of Physics to Other Sciences

### 3.1 Introduction

Physics is the most fundamental and all-inclusive of the sciences, and has had a profound eﬀect on all scientiﬁc development. In fact, physics is the present-day equivalent of what used to be called natural philosophy, from which most of our modern sciences arose. Students of many ﬁelds ﬁnd themselves studying physics because of the basic role it plays in all phenomena. In this chapter we shall try to explain what the fundamental problems in the other sciences are, but of course it is impossible in so small a space really to deal with the complex, subtle, beautiful matters in these other ﬁelds. Lack of space also prevents our discussing the relation of physics to engineering, industry, society, and war, or even the most remarkable relationship between mathematics and physics. (Mathematics is not a science from our point of view, in the sense that it is not a natural science. The test of its validity is not experiment.) We must, incidentally, make it clear from the beginning that if a thing is not a science, it is not necessarily bad. For example, love is not a science. So, if something is said not to be a science, it does not mean that there is something wrong with it; it just means that it is not a science.

3-1 引言

物理学是最基本的、包罗万象的一门学科，它对整个科学的发展有着深远的影响。事实上，物理学是与过去所谓的「自然哲学」相当的现代名称，现代科学大多数就是从自然哲学中产生的。许多领域内的学生都发现自己正在学习物理学，这是因为它在所有的现象中起着基本的作用。在本章中我们试图说明其他科学中的基本问题是什么。当然，在这么一点篇幅内要真正地处理这些领域中的复杂、精致而美妙的事情是不可能的。正因为篇幅较少，使我们不能讨论物理学与工程、工业、社会和战争之间的关系，甚至不能讨论数学与物理之间的最令人注目的关系（按照我们的观点，从数学不是一门自然科学这个意义上来说，它不是一门科学。它的正确性不是用实验来检验的）。顺便提一下，我们必须从一开始就说清楚如果一件事情不是科学，这并不一定不好。例如，爱好就不是科学。所以，如果说某件事不是科学，这并不意味着其中有什么错误的地方，这只是意味着它不是科学而已。

### 3.2 Chemistry

The science which is perhaps the most deeply aﬀected by physics is chemistry. Historically, the early days of chemistry dealt almost entirely with what we now call inorganic chemistry, the chemistry of substances which are not associated with living things. Considerable analysis was required to discover the existence of the many elements and their relationships — how they make the various relatively simple compounds found in rocks, earth, etc. This early chemistry was very important for physics. The interaction between the two sciences was very great because the theory of atoms was substantiated to a large extent by experiments in chemistry. The theory of chemistry, i.e., of the reactions themselves, was summarized to a large extent in the periodic chart of Mendeleev, which brings out many strange relationships among the various elements, and it was the collection of rules as to which substance is combined with which, and how, that constituted inorganic chemistry. All these rules were ultimately explained in principle by quantum mechanics, so that theoretical chemistry is in fact physics. On the other hand, it must be emphasized that this explanation is in principle. We have already discussed the diﬀerence between knowing the rules of the game of chess, and being able to play. So it is that we may know the rules, but we cannot play very well. It turns out to be very diﬃcult to predict precisely what will happen in a given chemical reaction; nevertheless, the deepest part of theoretical chemistry must end up in quantum mechanics.

There is also a branch of physics and chemistry which was developed by both sciences together, and which is extremely important. This is the method of statistics applied in a situation in which there are mechanical laws, which is aptly called statistical mechanics. In any chemical situation a large number of atoms are involved, and we have seen that the atoms are all jiggling around in a very random and complicated way. If we could analyze each collision, and be able to follow in detail the motion of each molecule, we might hope to ﬁgure out what would happen, but the many numbers needed to keep track of all these molecules exceeds so enormously the capacity of any computer, and certainly the capacity of the mind, that it was important to develop a method for dealing with such complicated situations. Statistical mechanics, then, is the science of the phenomena of heat, or thermodynamics. Inorganic chemistry is, as a science, now reduced essentially to what are called physical chemistry and quantum chemistry; physical chemistry to study the rates at which reactions occur and what is happening in detail (How do the molecules hit? Which pieces ﬂy oﬀ ﬁrst?, etc.), and quantum chemistry to help us understand what happens in terms of the physical laws.

The other branch of chemistry is organic chemistry, the chemistry of the substances which are associated with living things. For a time it was believed that the substances which are associated with living things were so marvelous that they could not be made by hand, from inorganic materials. This is not at all true —  they are just the same as the substances made in inorganic chemistry, but more complicated arrangements of atoms are involved. Organic chemistry obviously has a very close relationship to the biology which supplies its substances, and to industry, and furthermore, much physical chemistry and quantum mechanics can be applied to organic as well as to inorganic compounds. However, the main problems of organic chemistry are not in these aspects, but rather in the analysis and synthesis of the substances which are formed in biological systems, in living things. This leads imperceptibly, in steps, toward biochemistry, and then into biology itself, or molecular biology.

3-2 化学

也许受物理学影响最深的科学就是化学了。在历史上，早期的化学几乎完全讨论那些现在称为无机化学的内容，即讨论那些与生命体不发生联系的物质。人们曾经进行了大量的分析才发现许多元素的存在以及它们之间的关系 一一 即它们是怎样组成在矿石、土壤里所发现的简单化合物的，等等。早期的化学对于物理学是很重要的。这两门科学间的相互影响非常大，因为原子的理论在很大程度上是由化学实验来证实的。化学的理论，即化学反应本身的理论，在很大程度上总结在门捷列夫周期表里，周期表体现了各种元素之间的许多奇特的联系，它汇总了有关的规则：哪一种物质可以与哪一种物质化合，怎样化合，等等，这些就组成了无机化学。原则上，所有这些规则最终可以从量子力学得到解释，所以理论化学实际上就是物理。但是，必须强调的是，这种解释只是原则上的。我们已经讨论过了解下棋规则与擅长下棋之间的差别。也就是说，我们可能知道有关的规则，但是下得不一定很好。我们知道，精确地预言某个化学反应中会出现什么情况是十分困难的；然而，理论化学的最深刻部分必定会归结到量子力学。

还有一门由物理学与化学共同发展起来的极其重要的分支，这就是把统计学的方法应用于力学定律起作用的场合，这被恰当地称之为统计力学。在任何化学状态中都要涉及大量的原子，我们已经看到原子总是以复杂而毫无规则的方式不停地晃动。假如我们能够分析每一次碰撞，并且跟踪每一个分子的运动细节的话，就能判断出将会发生一些什么。但是要记录所有这些分子就需要许许多多数据，这远远超过了任何计算机的容量，当然也一定超过人脑的容量，所以为了处理这样复杂的情况，重要的是要采取一种有效的方法。统计力学就是关于热现象或热力学的理论。作为一门科学，无机化学现在基本上已归结为所谓物理化学和量子化学。物理化学研究反应率和所发生的详细变化（分子间如何碰撞？哪一些分子先飞离？等等），而量子化学则帮助我们根据物理定律来理解所发生的事。

化学的另一个分支是有机化学，它研究与生命体有关的物质。人们曾一度相信与生命有关的物质极其神秘，因此不可能用我们的手从无机材料中制造出这种物质。这根本不对 —— 它们与无机化学中制成的物质完全一样，只是包括了更复杂的原子排列。很明显，有机化学与提供有机物质的生物学之间有十分密切的关系，与工业也有密切的联系，而且许多物理化学和量子化学的定律不仅适用于无机化合物的情况，而且也适用于有机化合物。然而，有机化学的主要任务并不在于这些方面，而是在于分析、综合那些在生物系统以及在生命体中所形成的物质。这样就不知不觉地逐步引向了生物化学，然后是生物学本身，或分子生物学。

### 3.3 Biology

Thus we come to the science of biology, which is the study of living things. In the early days of biology, the biologists had to deal with the purely descriptive problem of ﬁnding out what living things there were, and so they just had to count such things as the hairs of the limbs of ﬂeas. After these matters were worked out with a great deal of interest, the biologists went into the machinery inside the living bodies, ﬁrst from a gross standpoint, naturally, because it takes some eﬀort to get into the ﬁner details.

There was an interesting early relationship between physics and biology in which biology helped physics in the discovery of the conservation of energy, which was ﬁrst demonstrated by Mayer in connection with the amount of heat taken in and given out by a living creature.

If we look at the processes of biology of living animals more closely, we see many physical phenomena: the circulation of blood, pumps, pressure, etc. There are nerves: we know what is happening when we step on a sharp stone, and that somehow or other the information goes from the leg up. It is interesting how that happens. In their study of nerves, the biologists have come to the conclusion that nerves are very ﬁne tubes with a complex wall which is very thin; through this wall the cell pumps ions, so that there are positive ions on the outside and negative ions on the inside, like a capacitor. Now this membrane has an interesting property; if it「discharges」in one place, i.e., if some of the ions were able to move through one place, so that the electric voltage is reduced there, that electrical inﬂuence makes itself felt on the ions in the neighborhood, and it aﬀects the membrane in such a way that it lets the ions through at neighboring points also. This in turn aﬀects it farther along, etc., and so there is a wave of「penetrability」of the membrane which runs down the ﬁber when it is「excited」at one end by stepping on the sharp stone. This wave is somewhat analogous to a long sequence of vertical dominoes; if the end one is pushed over, that one pushes the next, etc. Of course this will transmit only one message unless the dominoes are set up again; and similarly in the nerve cell, there are processes which pump the ions slowly out again, to get the nerve ready for the next impulse. So it is that we know what we are doing (or at least where we are). Of course the electrical eﬀects associated with this nerve impulse can be picked up with electrical instruments, and because there are electrical eﬀects, obviously the physics of electrical eﬀects has had a great deal of inﬂuence on understanding the phenomenon.

The opposite eﬀect is that, from somewhere in the brain, a message is sent out along a nerve. What happens at the end of the nerve? There the nerve branches out into ﬁne little things, connected to a structure near a muscle, called an endplate. For reasons which are not exactly understood, when the impulse reaches the end of the nerve, little packets of a chemical called acetylcholine are shot oﬀ (ﬁve or ten molecules at a time) and they aﬀect the muscle ﬁber and make it contract — how simple! What makes a muscle contract? A muscle is a very large number of ﬁbers close together, containing two diﬀerent substances, myosin and actomyosin, but the machinery by which the chemical reaction induced by acetylcholine can modify the dimensions of the muscle is not yet known. Thus the fundamental processes in the muscle that make mechanical motions are not known.

Biology is such an enormously wide ﬁeld that there are hosts of other problems that we cannot mention at all — problems on how vision works (what the light does in the eye), how hearing works, etc. (The way in which thinking works we shall discuss later under psychology.) Now, these things concerning biology which we have just discussed are, from a biological standpoint, really not fundamental, at the bottom of life, in the sense that even if we understood them we still would not understand life itself. To illustrate: the men who study nerves feel their work is very important, because after all you cannot have animals without nerves. But you can have life without nerves. Plants have neither nerves nor muscles, but they are working, they are alive, just the same. So for the fundamental problems of biology we must look deeper; when we do, we discover that all living things have a great many characteristics in common. The most common feature is that they are made of cells, within each of which is complex machinery for doing things chemically. In plant cells, for example, there is machinery for picking up light and generating glucose, which is consumed in the dark to keep the plant alive. When the plant is eaten the glucose itself generates in the animal a series of chemical reactions very closely related to photosynthesis (and its opposite eﬀect in the dark) in plants.

In the cells of living systems there are many elaborate chemical reactions, in which one compound is changed into another and another. To give some impression of the enormous eﬀorts that have gone into the study of biochemistry, the chart in Fig. 3-1 summarizes our knowledge to date on just one small part of the many series of reactions which occur in cells, perhaps a percent or so of it. 

Here we see a whole series of molecules which change from one to another in a sequence or cycle of rather small steps. It is called the Krebs cycle, the respiratory cycle. Each of the chemicals and each of the steps is fairly simple, in terms of what change is made in the molecule, but — and this is a centrally important discovery in biochemistry — these changes are relatively diﬃcult to accomplish in a laboratory. 

If we have one substance and another very similar substance, the one does not just turn into the other, because the two forms are usually separated by an energy barrier or「hill.」Consider this analogy: If we wanted to take an object from one place to another, at the same level but on the other side of a hill, we could push it over the top, but to do so requires the addition of some energy. Thus most chemical reactions do not occur, because there is what is called an activation energy in the way. In order to add an extra atom to our chemical requires that we get it close enough that some rearrangement can occur; then it will stick. But if we cannot give it enough energy to get it close enough, it will not go to completion, it will just go part way up the「hill」and back down again. However, if we could literally take the molecules in our hands and push and pull the atoms around in such a way as to open a hole to let the new atom in, and then let it snap back, we would have found another way, around the hill, which would not require extra energy, and the reaction would go easily. Now there actually are, in the cells, very large molecules, much larger than the ones whose changes we have been describing, which in some complicated way hold the smaller molecules just right, so that the reaction can occur easily. These very large and complicated things are called enzymes. (They were ﬁrst called ferments, because they were originally discovered in the fermentation of sugar. In fact, some of the ﬁrst reactions in the cycle were discovered there.) In the presence of an enzyme the reaction will go.

Fig. 3-1. The Krebs cycle.

An enzyme is made of another substance called protein. Enzymes are very big and complicated, and each one is diﬀerent, each being built to control a certain special reaction. The names of the enzymes are written in Fig. 3-1 at each reaction. (Sometimes the same enzyme may control two reactions.) We emphasize that the enzymes themselves are not involved in the reaction directly. They do not change; they merely let an atom go from one place to another. Having done so, the enzyme is ready to do it to the next molecule, like a machine in a factory. Of course, there must be a supply of certain atoms and a way of disposing of other atoms. Take hydrogen, for example: there are enzymes which have special units on them which carry the hydrogen for all chemical reactions. For example, there are three or four hydrogen-reducing enzymes which are used all over our cycle in diﬀerent places. It is interesting that the machinery which liberates some hydrogen at one place will take that hydrogen and use it somewhere else.

The most important feature of the cycle of Fig. 3-1 is the transformation from GDP to GTP (guanosine-di-phosphate to guanosine-tri-phosphate) because the one substance has much more energy in it than the other. Just as there is a「box」in certain enzymes for carrying hydrogen atoms around, there are special energy-carrying「boxes」which involve the triphosphate group. So, GTP has more energy than GDP and if the cycle is going one way, we are producing molecules which have extra energy and which can go drive some other cycle which requires energy, for example the contraction of muscle. The muscle will not contract unless there is GTP. We can take muscle ﬁber, put it in water, and add GTP, and the ﬁbers contract, changing GTP to GDP if the right enzymes are present. So the real system is in the GDP-GTP transformation; in the dark the GTP which has been stored up during the day is used to run the whole cycle around the other way. An enzyme, you see, does not care in which direction the reaction goes, for if it did it would violate one of the laws of physics.

Physics is of great importance in biology and other sciences for still another reason, that has to do with experimental techniques. In fact, if it were not for the great development of experimental physics, these biochemistry charts would not be known today. The reason is that the most useful tool of all for analyzing this fantastically complex system is to label the atoms which are used in the reactions. Thus, if we could introduce into the cycle some carbon dioxide which has a「green mark」on it, and then measure after three seconds where the green mark is, and again measure after ten seconds, etc., we could trace out the course of the reactions. What are the「green marks」? They are diﬀerent isotopes. We recall that the chemical properties of atoms are determined by the number of electrons, not by the mass of the nucleus. But there can be, for example in carbon, six neutrons or seven neutrons, together with the six protons which all carbon nuclei have. Chemically, the two atoms C12 and C13 are the same, but they diﬀer in weight and they have diﬀerent nuclear properties, and so they are distinguishable. By using these isotopes of diﬀerent weights, or even radioactive isotopes like C14, which provide a more sensitive means for tracing very small quantities, it is possible to trace the reactions.

Now, we return to the description of enzymes and proteins. All proteins are not enzymes, but all enzymes are proteins. There are many proteins, such as the proteins in muscle, the structural proteins which are, for example, in cartilage and hair, skin, etc., that are not themselves enzymes. However, proteins are a very characteristic substance of life: ﬁrst of all they make up all the enzymes, and second, they make up much of the rest of living material. Proteins have a very interesting and simple structure. They are a series, or chain, of diﬀerent amino acids. There are twenty diﬀerent amino acids, and they all can combine with each other to form chains in which the backbone is CO-NH, etc. Proteins are nothing but chains of various ones of these twenty amino acids. Each of the amino acids probably serves some special purpose. Some, for example, have a sulfur atom at a certain place; when two sulfur atoms are in the same protein, they form a bond, that is, they tie the chain together at two points and form a loop. Another has extra oxygen atoms which make it an acidic substance, another has a basic characteristic. Some of them have big groups hanging out to one side, so that they take up a lot of space. One of the amino acids, called proline, is not really an amino acid, but imino acid. There is a slight diﬀerence, with the result that when proline is in the chain, there is a kink in the chain. If we wished to manufacture a particular protein, we would give these instructions: put one of those sulfur hooks here; next, add something to take up space; then attach something to put a kink in the chain. In this way, we will get a complicated-looking chain, hooked together and having some complex structure; this is presumably just the manner in which all the various enzymes are made. One of the great triumphs in recent times (since 1960), was at last to discover the exact spatial atomic arrangement of certain proteins, which involve some ﬁfty-six or sixty amino acids in a row. Over a thousand atoms (more nearly two thousand, if we count the hydrogen atoms) have been located in a complex pattern in two proteins. The ﬁrst was hemoglobin. One of the sad aspects of this discovery is that we cannot see anything from the pattern; we do not understand why it works the way it does. Of course, that is the next problem to be attacked.

Another problem is how do the enzymes know what to be? A red-eyed ﬂy makes a red-eyed ﬂy baby, and so the information for the whole pattern of enzymes to make red pigment must be passed from one ﬂy to the next. This is done by a substance in the nucleus of the cell, not a protein, called DNA (short for des-oxyribose nucleic acid). This is the key substance which is passed from one cell to another (for instance sperm cells consist mostly of DNA) and carries the information as to how to make the enzymes. DNA is the「blueprint.」What does the blueprint look like and how does it work? First, the blueprint must be able to reproduce itself. Secondly, it must be able to instruct the protein. Concerning the reproduction, we might think that this proceeds like cell reproduction. Cells simply grow bigger and then divide in half. Must it be thus with DNA molecules, then, that they too grow bigger and divide in half? Every atom certainly does not grow bigger and divide in half! No, it is impossible to reproduce a molecule except by some more clever way.

The structure of the substance DNA was studied for a long time, ﬁrst chemi- cally to ﬁnd the composition, and then with x-rays to ﬁnd the pattern in space. The result was the following remarkable discovery: The DNA molecule is a pair of chains, twisted upon each other. The backbone of each of these chains, which are analogous to the chains of proteins but chemically quite diﬀerent, is a series of sugar and phosphate groups, as shown in Fig. 3-2. Now we see how the chain can contain instructions, for if we could split this chain down the middle, we would have a series BAADC . . . and every living thing could have a diﬀerent series. Thus perhaps, in some way, the speciﬁc instructions for the manufacture of proteins are contained in the speciﬁc series of the DNA.

Fig. 3-2. Schematic diagram of DNA.

Attached to each sugar along the line, and linking the two chains together, are certain pairs of cross-links. However, they are not all of the same kind; there are four kinds, called adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine, but let us call them A, B, C, and D. The interesting thing is that only certain pairs can sit opposite each other, for example A with B and C with D. These pairs are put on the two chains in such a way that they「ﬁt together,」and have a strong energy of interaction. However, C will not ﬁt with A, and B will not ﬁt with C; they will only ﬁt in pairs, A against B and C against D. Therefore if one is C, the other must be D, etc. Whatever the letters may be in one chain, each one must have its speciﬁc complementary letter on the other chain. What then about reproduction? Suppose we split this chain in two. How can we make another one just like it? If, in the substances of the cells, there is a manufacturing department which brings up phosphate, sugar, and A, B, C, D units not connected in a chain, the only ones which will attach to our split chain will be the correct ones, the complements of BAADC . . ., namely, ABBCD . . . Thus what happens is that the chain splits down the middle during cell division, one half ultimately to go with one cell, the other half to end up in the other cell; when separated, a new complementary chain is made by each half-chain.

Next comes the question, precisely how does the order of the A, B, C, D units determine the arrangement of the amino acids in the protein? This is the central unsolved problem in biology today. The ﬁrst clues, or pieces of information, however, are these: There are in the cell tiny particles called ribosomes, and it is now known that that is the place where proteins are made. But the ribosomes are not in the nucleus, where the DNA and its instructions are. Something seems to be the matter. However, it is also known that little molecule pieces come oﬀ the DNA — not as long as the big DNA molecule that carries all the information itself, but like a small section of it. This is called RNA, but that is not essential. It is a kind of copy of the DNA, a short copy. The RNA, which somehow carries a message as to what kind of protein to make goes over to the ribosome; that is known. When it gets there, protein is synthesized at the ribosome. That is also known. However, the details of how the amino acids come in and are arranged in accordance with a code that is on the RNA are, as yet, still unknown. We do not know how to read it. If we knew, for example, the「lineup」A, B, C, C, A, we could not tell you what protein is to be made. Certainly no subject or ﬁeld is making more progress on so many fronts at the present moment, than biology, and if we were to name the most powerful assumption of all, which leads one on and on in an attempt to understand life, it is that all things are made of atoms, and that everything that living things do can be understood in terms of the jigglings and wigglings of atoms.

3-3 生物学

我们就这样进入了生物学，它研究的是生命体。在生物学发展的早期，生物学家必须进行单纯的说明性工作 一一 找出有哪个生物，所以他们要数数跳蚤足上的细毛之类的东西。当他们以很大的兴趣完成这种工作后，就进而考虑在生命体内部的机制问题，起先自然是从十分粗略的观点出发的，因为要知道更详细的情况是需要经过一番努力的。

在物理学与生物学的早期关系中有过一件很有趣的事，生物学曾经帮助物理学发现了能量守恒定建，迈耶（J. R. Mayer）最先在关于生物吸收和放出的热量问题上证实了这条定律。

假如我们更仔细地观察动物的生物学过程，就会看到许多物理现象：血液的循环、心脏的跳动、血压，等等。这里还有神经：如果我们踩在一块尖锐的岩石上，就会知道发生了什么事情，这个信息不知怎么地就从我们的脚底传递上来。有趣的是这个信息是怎样传递的。在研究神经时，生物学家得到了这样的结论：神经是非常精细的小管道，有十分薄而复杂的管壁。细胞通过这样的管壁吸进离子，所以在外面有正离子，而在里面则有负离子，就像个电容器一样。这层薄膜还有一个有趣的性质：如果它在某个地方「放电」，即一些离子能够通过这个地方，那么该处的电压就减小，它会影响到邻近地方的离子，而这又会影响那里的薄膜，使它也让离子通过。接着这又要影响更远的薄膜，等等，于是在薄膜中就出现一列「穿透性变动」波，当神经末梢的一端由于碰到尖锐的岩石而受到「刺激」后，这种波就沿着神经传开来。它有点像一长列垂直放置的多米诺骨牌，如果末端的一个被推倒，邻近的一个也就被它带动，等等。当然，除非把多米诺骨牌再重新排好，不然这时只有一个信息传递过去。类似地，在神经元里，也有排出离子的缓慢过程，使神经又处于准备接收下一个脉冲的状态。这就是为什么我们会知道正在做什么（或者至少知道我们在哪里）。当然我们可以用电子仪器测出这种与神经冲动有关的电的效应，因为这里存在着电的作用。十分明显，电效应的物理知识对理解这个现象很起作用。

相反的效应是从大脑中某个地方沿着神经发出一个信息。这时在神经的末梢会出现什么情况呢？神经在末梢处分成了细微的小纤维，这些小纤维与肌肉附近的一种称为端板的结构相连接。由于一些现在还不完全理解的原因，当脉冲信号抵达神经末梢后，射出一小团小团称为乙酰胆碱的化学物质（每次 5-10 个分子），它们影响了肌肉纤维而使其收缩 一一 这一切多么简单！什么东西使肌肉会发生收缩呢？肌肉是由极多的彼此紧贴的纤维所组成的，它含有两种不同的物质：肌球蛋白和肌动球蛋白。但是由乙酰胆碱所引起的那种改变分子大小的化学反应机制现在还不清楚，因而在肌肉中引起机械运动的基本过程也未被我们所知。

2『肌肉的两种蛋白，做一张信息数据卡片。（2021-02-08）』—— 已完成

生物学的领域是如此广泛，有许多问题我们根本无法叙述。比如视觉是如何产生的（即光在眼晴里做什么）？听觉是如何产生的？等等（思维是如何进行的这一个问题将在后面心理学中讨论）。但是从生物学的观点来说，我们刚才所讨论的这些关于生物学的事情实在并不是基本的，并且不是生命的根源 一一 即使我们理解了它们，仍然不能理解生命本身。

举一个例子：研究神经的人感到他们的工作是很重要的，因为无论如何不存在没有神经的动物，但是没有神经仍然可以有生命。植物既无神经也无肌肉，但是它们照样活动着，照样生存着。所以我们对于生物学的基本问题必须更仔细地研究一下。如果我们这样做，就会发现所有的生命体中存在着许多共同的特征。最普遍的特征是它们都由细胞组成，每个细胞内都有起化学作用的复杂机制。例如，在植物细胞中就存在着接收光线而产生蔗糖的机构，植物在夜间消耗蔗糖以维持其生存。当动物摄取植物后蔗糖在动物体内就产生了一系列化学反应，这些反应与植物体内的光合作用（以及在夜间的相反作用）有很密切的关系。

在生命系统的细胞里有许多复杂的化学反应，在反应中一种化合物变成另一种化合物，然后再变成一种化合物。为了对生物化学研究中所付出的巨大的努力有某种印象，我们在图 3-1 中总结了到此刻为止所知道的在细胞中出现的反应，这些反应只是所有反应中的很小一部分，只占 1% 左右。

这里我们可以看到整整一系列分子，它们在一连串相当小的步骤组成的循环中从一个变到另一个。这个循环称为三羧酸循环或呼吸循环。如果从分子发生的变化来说，每一种化合物和每一步反应都是相当简单的，但是 一一 这是生物化学中非常重要的发现 —— 这些变化在验室里比较难以完成。假如我们有一种物质，还有另一种十分类似的物质，那么前一种物质并不就转成后一种物质，因为这两种形式通常由一个能量屏障或「势垒」隔开。

考虑这样一个类似的情况：如果我们要把一个物体从一个地方拿到另一个地方，而这两个地方处在相同的水平高度，但是分别在一座小山的两边，那么我们可以把物体推过山顶，但是要做到这一点需要一些附加的能量。由于这种原因，大多数化学反应都不会发生，因为有种所谓的活化能妨碍这一反应的进行。为了在一种化合物中增加一个额外的原子，就要使这个原子靠得足够紧，以便能出现某种重新排列，这样它就结合到那个化合物上去了。但是如果我们不能给它足够的能量使之靠得足够近，它就不会越过势垒，只是上去了一部分路程后又倒退回来。然而，假如我们真的能把分子拿在手中，把其中的原子推来推去使它出现个缺口，让新原子进入，然后又使缺口一下子合拢，我们就找到了另一个办法，即绕过势垒，这不需要额外的能量，因此反应就较容易进行。现在，在细胞里确实存在着一些很大的分子，比起我们刚描述过其变化的分子要大得多，它们以某种复杂的方式使较小的分子处于恰当的状态，从而使反应易于发生。这些很大的、复杂的分子称为酶（它们起先被叫做酵素，因为最早是在糖发酵时发现的。事实上三羧酸循环的某些反应最初就是在发酵中发现的）。由于有酶存在，反应就会进行。

2『这里介绍的酶、催化剂的原理，以一座小山两边同水平位置上的石头做隐喻，绝妙。做一张信息数据卡片。』—— 已完成

酶是由另一种称为蛋白质的物质构成的。酶分子族是非常庞大而复杂的，每一种酶互不相同，并且都控制着一定的特殊反应。图 3-1 中每个反应中都写上了酶的名称（有时同种酶可以控制两种反应）。我们要强调指出：酶本身并不直接参与反应，它们并没有变化，只是使一个原子从一个地方跑到另一个地方。干完了这件事后，它又准备对下一个原子做同样的事，犹如工厂里的机器一样。当然，必须对某种原子进行补充，并且可以处理另一些原子。比如，以氢为例，有些酶具有特殊的结构单元，能在各种化学反应中运送氢原子。例如，有三种或四种脱氢酶在我们整个循环的各个地方都用到。有趣的是，有一种机构使一个地方释放某些氢原子并将其取走，然后用到其他的地方去。

图 3-1 的循环中最重要的是 GDP 转变为 GTP（二酸鸟嘌呤核苷变为三磷酸鸟嘌呤核苷），因为 GTP 比 GDP 含有更多的能量。就像在某些酶中存在着一种运送氢原子的「盒子」一样，在酶中也有特殊的携带能量的「盒子」，三磷酸基就是这样的「盒子」。所以 GTP 比 GDP 具有更多的能量，而且如果循环是朝某个方向时，我们就产生具有附加能量的分子，它可以推动另一个需要能量的循环，比如肌肉的收缩。除非存在着 GTP，肌肉就不会收缩。我们可以拿几根肌肉纤维，把它们浸到水里，加一些 GTP，只要这里存在着适当的酶，肌肉纤维就会收缩，GTP 就变为 GDP。所以真实的系统是在 GDP-GTP 转变中，在晚上就用白天贮藏起来的 GTP 使整个循环往另ー个方向进行。你们可以看到酶对反应进行的方向并不介意，因为倘若不是如此，就会违反一条物理定律。

物理学对于生物学和其他科学之所以极为重要还在于另一个原因，这与实验技术有关。事实上，如果不是由于实验物理的巨大发展，这些生物化学的循环图今天就不可能知道。其理由是：分析这种极其复杂的系统的最有效的方法就是要辨认在反应过程中所用到的原子。例如，如果我们能把一些带有「绿色标记」的二氧化碳引到循环中去，然后测量 3s 后绿色标记的位置，在 10s 后再测量一次，等等，我们就能描绘出反应的过程。那么「绿色标记」是什么呢？它们就是同位素。

我们可以回顾一下：原子的化学性质是由电子的数量而不是原子核的质量所决定的。但是有这种可能，比如在碳原子中，可能有 6 个或 7 个中子与每个碳原子核都具有的 6 个质子在一起。这两个原子碳 12 和碳 13 在化学上是相同的，但它们的重量不同，在核的性质上也有差别，因而是可以区分的。利用这些不同重量的同位素，或者甚至利用放射性同位素如碳 14，就有可能眼踪反应的过程，这是比较灵敏的探査极少量物质的方法。

现在，让我们回到酶和蛋白质的描述。并不是所有的蛋白质都是酶，但是所有的酶都是蛋白质。蛋白质有许多种，比如说肌肉中的蛋白质、结构蛋白质，它们存在于软骨、头发和皮肤中，等等，这些蛋白质本身并不是酶。但是，蛋白质是生命的非常具有代表性的物质。首先，它们组成了所有的酶；其次，它们构成了大部分其余的生命的物质。蛋白质具有十分有趣而简单的结构。它们是一系列不同的氨基酸。有 20 种不同的氨基酸，它们全都能互相组合而形成链，其骨架是 CO-NH，等等。蛋白质不是别的，正是这 20 种氨基酸形成的各种各样的链。每一种氨基酸可能起某种特定的作用。

比如，有一些氨基酸在一定的位置上有一个硫原子；当同一蛋白质内有两个硫原子时，它们就形成一个键，也就是说，它们用链在这两点上连接起来形成一个环。另一种氨基酸有一个额外的氧原子，因而使它变为酸性物质，再有一种则呈碱性的特征。有些氨基酸在一边悬挂着一个大基团，因此占有许多空间。有一种称为脯氨酸的氨基酸实际上并不是氨基酸，而是亚氨基酸。这里稍微有些差别，因为当脯氨酸在链上时，就会出现扭曲。如果我们想制造一种特殊的蛋白质，就应当按照这样的规则：这里先放一个硫钩；然后加进某种东西来占据空位；再加入某种东西以形成链上的扭曲。这样，我们将得到一个外观上复杂的链，它们互相钩连在一起，具有某种复杂的结构。这可能就是所有的酶形成的方式。

1960 年以来，我们所获得的伟大成就之一就是终于发现了某些蛋白质的原子的精确空间排列。在这些蛋白质中，一条链上就含有 56 个或 60 个左右的氨基酸链，在两种蛋白质的复杂图样中已经确定了 1000 个以上的原子（如果把氢原子计入，那么就接近于 2000 个）的位置。第一种阐明结构的蛋白质就是血红蛋白。这个发现的不足之处是我们从这样的图样中不能看出任何东西，我们不理解它为什么会具有那样的功能。当然，这是下一步需要解决的问题。

另一个问题是，酶怎么会知道该成为什么？一个红眼蝇会生出一个小的红眼蝇，这样产生红色素的整个酶组信息必定从一代传到下一代。这是由细胞核中的一种称为 DNA（脱氧核糖核酸的缩写）的物质所完成的，它不是蛋白质。这种关键的物质从一个细胞传到另一个细胞（例如，精虫细胞主要由 DNA 组成），并且携带了关于如何形成酶的信息。DNA 是张「蓝图」。那么这张蓝图看来像什么？它又如何起作用？

首先，这张蓝图必须能加以复制。其次，它必须能给蛋白质以指令。说到复制，我们可能会认为这种过程像细胞的复制。但细胞只是简单地长大，然后一分为二。那么 DNA 分子也必须如此吗？它们也是长大以后分为二吗？每一个原子当然不会长大并一分为！因此，除非有一种更聪明的办法，否则就不可能复制出一个分子来。

对 DNA 这种物质的结构已经进行了很长时间的研究，首先用化学方法找出它的成分。然后又用 X 射线法找出它在空间的图像。结果得到如下值得注意的发现：DNA 分子是一对彼此缠绕在一起的链。这些链与蛋白质的链类似，但化学结构上是完全不同的，每条链的骨架是一列糖与磷酸基，如图 3-2 所示。现在我们看出链是怎样容纳指令的，因为如果我们把这个链从中间劈开，就可以得到一个 BAADC… 系列，而每个生命体都可以有一个不同的系列。这样，也许为制造蛋白质所需的特殊指令已以某种方式包括在 DNA 的特殊系列里。

与链上的每一个糖相结合，并把两条链连接在一起的是一些交叉链对。然而它们并不都是相同的，总共有四种：腺嘌呤、胸腺嘧啶、胞啶及鸟嘌呤。现在让我们称它们为 A、B、C 和 D。有趣的是，只有一定的配对才能彼此处于相对的位置，例如 A 对 B，C 对 D。当这些对放在两列链上时，它们「彼此对合」，并具有强大的相互作用能。然而 C 不适合于 A，B 也不适合于 C；它们的适合配对是 A 对 B，C 对 D。所以假如有一个是 C，另一个就定是 D，等等。在一条链上无论是什么字母，在另一条链上则必须有特定的与之配对的字母。

那么，复制又是怎么一回事呢？假设我们把这整条链一分为二，我们怎么能制造出另一个正好与它样的链呢？如果在细胞的物质中有一种加工部门，产生了磷酸盐、糖以及没有连在一个链上的 A、B、C、D 单元，那么唯一能与我们那个分开的链相连的单元必须是正确的，是 BAADC… 的互补体，即 ABBCD……。于是，当细胞分裂时，链亦从中间裂开，一半最终与其中一个细胞在一起，而另一半则留在另一个细胞内；当它们分离后，每个半链都会形成一个新的补足的链。

接下来的问题是，A、B、C、D 单元的次序究竟怎样精确地决定蛋白质中氨基酸的排列？这是今天生物学中没有解决的一个中心问题。然而，初步的线索，或者说一点信息是：细胞中存在一种叫做微粒体的小粒子，现已知道那就是制造蛋白质的地方。但是微粒体并不在细胞核内，而 DNA 及它的指令却在细胞核内。看来是有某种原因的。然而，现在也知道从 DNA 分出的小分子，不像携带有全部信息的大 DNA 分子那样长，而像它的一小部分，它叫 RNA。但这无关紧要，RNA 是一种 DNA 的拷贝个简短的拷贝。RNA 不知怎么地携带了关于要制造那种蛋白质信息，跑到微粒体中，这一点我们已经知道了。

当它到达那里后，在微粒体中就合成出蛋白质，这一点也已经知道了。不过，氨基酸怎样进入蛋白质，又怎样根据 RNA 上的密码来排列，等等，这些细节还不太清楚。我们不知道如何去解这种密码。比方说，假如我们知道了一排字母 ABCCA，我们也无法告诉你要制造的是什么蛋白质。

今天，无疑没有一个学科或领域在这样多的前沿上比生物学取得更大的进展。如果我们要作出引导着人们在探索生命的努力中不断前进的最有成效的假说，这就是：所有的物质都是由原子组成的，并且生命体所做的每一件事都可以从原子的摆动和晃动中来理解。

### 3.4 Astronomy

In this rapid-ﬁre explanation of the whole world, we must now turn to astron- omy. Astronomy is older than physics. In fact, it got physics started by showing the beautiful simplicity of the motion of the stars and planets, the understanding of which was the beginning of physics. But the most remarkable discovery in all of astronomy is that the stars are made of atoms of the same kind as those on the earth.`*` How was this done? Atoms liberate light which has deﬁnite frequencies, something like the timbre of a musical instrument, which has deﬁnite pitches or frequencies of sound. When we are listening to several diﬀerent tones we can tell them apart, but when we look with our eyes at a mixture of colors we cannot tell the parts from which it was made, because the eye is nowhere near as discerning as the ear in this connection. However, with a spectroscope we can analyze the frequencies of the light waves and in this way we can see the very tunes of the atoms that are in the diﬀerent stars. As a matter of fact, two of the chemical elements were discovered on a star before they were discovered on the earth. Helium was discovered on the sun, whence its name, and technetium was discovered in certain cool stars. This, of course, permits us to make headway in understanding the stars, because they are made of the same kinds of atoms which are on the earth. Now we know a great deal about the atoms, especially concerning their behavior under conditions of high temperature but not very great density, so that we can analyze by statistical mechanics the behavior of the stellar substance. Even though we cannot reproduce the conditions on the earth, using the basic physical laws we often can tell precisely, or very closely, what will happen. So it is that physics aids astronomy. Strange as it may seem, we understand the distribution of matter in the interior of the sun far better than we understand the interior of the earth. What goes on inside a star is better understood than one might guess from the diﬃculty of having to look at a little dot of light through a telescope, because we can calculate what the atoms in the stars should do in most circumstances. One of the most impressive discoveries was the origin of the energy of the stars, that makes them continue to burn. One of the men who discovered this was out with his girl friend the night after he realized that nuclear reactions must be going on in the stars in order to make them shine. She said「Look at how pretty the stars shine!」He said「Yes, and right now I am the only man in the world who knows why they shine.」She merely laughed at him. She was not impressed with being out with the only man who, at that moment, knew why stars shine. Well, it is sad to be alone, but that is the way it is in this world.

It is the nuclear「burning」of hydrogen which supplies the energy of the sun; the hydrogen is converted into helium. Furthermore, ultimately, the manufacture of various chemical elements proceeds in the centers of the stars, from hydrogen. The stuﬀ of which we are made, was「cooked」once, in a star, and spit out. How do we know? Because there is a clue. The proportion of the diﬀerent isotopes — how much C12, how much C13, etc., is something which is never changed by chemical reactions, because the chemical reactions are so much the same for the two. The proportions are purely the result of nuclear reactions. By looking at the proportions of the isotopes in the cold, dead ember which we are, we can discover what the furnace was like in which the stuﬀ of which we are made was formed. That furnace was like the stars, and so it is very likely that our elements were「made」in the stars and spit out in the explosions which we call novae and supernovae. Astronomy is so close to physics that we shall study many astronomical things as we go along.

`*` How I’m rushing through this! How much each sentence in this brief story contains.「The stars are made of the same atoms as the earth.」I usually pick one small topic like this to give a lecture on. Poets say science takes away from the beauty of the stars — mere globs of gas atoms. Nothing is「mere.」I too can see the stars on a desert night, and feel them. But do I see less or more? The vastness of the heavens stretches my imagination — stuck on this carousel my little eye can catch one-million-year-old light. A vast pattern — of which I am a part — perhaps my stuﬀ was belched from some forgotten star, as one is belching there. Or see them with the greater eye of Palomar, rushing all apart from some common starting point when they were perhaps all together. What is the pattern, or the meaning, or the why? It does not do harm to the mystery to know a little about it. For far more marvelous is the truth than any artists of the past imagined! Why do the poets of the present not speak of it? What men are poets who can speak of Jupiter if he were like a man, but if he is an immense spinning sphere of methane and ammonia must be silent?

在我们对整个世界非常概括的描绘中，现在必须转到天文学上。天文学是一门比物理学更古老的学科。事实上，正是天文学向物理学提出了解释星体运动得如此美妙而又简单的问题，对于这个问题的理解，就构成了物理学的开端。但是在所有的天文学发现中，最值得注意的是：星体是由同地球一样的原子组成的 `*`。那么这是怎么知道的呢？原子释放具有确定频率的光，这有点像乐器的音色是具有确定的音调或频率的声音。当我们听见几种不同的音调时，可以分别说出它们由来，但是当我们用眼睛观察混合的颜色时，却无法说出它由哪几种颜色组成，因为眼晴的辨能力在这一点上远远比不上耳朵。然而，利用分光镜我们可以分析光波的频率，这样就可以看见各个不同星体上的原子所发出的真正「音调」。事实上，有两种化学元素在地球上被发现之前就已经在星体上发现了。氦是在太阳上发现的，它的名称就是由此而来的 `*`；锝是在一种冷却的星体上发现的。这当然使我们在理解星体方面取得了一定的进展，因为它们也是由跟地球上同样的原子组成的。今天，我们已经知道了许多有关原子的知识，特别是它们在高温而密度不太大的条件下的行为，这样我们就能用统计力学的方法来分析星体物质的性能。即使我们无法在地球上复现有关的条件，但是应用基本的物理定律往往能精确地或十分接近地说出会发生什么事情。这就是物理学帮助了天文学。看来令人奇怪的是，我们对太阳内部物质的分布情况的了解远胜于对自己脚下的地球内部情况的了解。我们对星体内部发生的情况的了解要比在人们必须通过望远镜来观察小小的光点这种困难的情况下可能推测出更多一些，因为在大多数情况下，我们可以算出星体里的原子应当做些什么。

给人印象最深的发现之一是使星球不断发出光和热的能量来源问题。有一个参与这项发现的人，在他认识到要使恒星发光，就必须在恒星上不断地进行核反应之后的一天晚上和他的一位女朋友出去散步。当这个女朋友说：「看这些星星闪烁得多美啊！」他说：「是的，在此刻我是世界上唯一知道为什么它们会发光的人。」他的女朋友只不过对他笑笑。她并没有对于同当时唯一知道恒星发光原因的人一起散步产生什么深刻的印象。的确，孤单是可悲的，不过在这个世界上就是这个样子。

正是氢原子核的「燃烧」太阳提供了能量，这时氢也就转变成了氦，而且，最终从氢制造出各种化学元素的过程是在恒星的中心进行的。组成我们身体的各种元素在一个星体上被「烹调」好后，就被抛出，存在于宇宙之中。我们是怎么知道的呢？因为这里有一条线索。化学反应永远改变不了不同的同位素的比例 一一 多少碳 12，多少碳 13，等等，因为化学反应对两者而言都是大致相同的。这个比例纯粹是核反应的结果。看看，在熄灭的、冷却的余烬 一一 比如我们自己就是这样的产物 —— 里同位素的比例，就可以发现在构成我们身体材料的形成时期熔炉像什么样子。这个熔炉很像恒星，所以我们的元素很可能是在恒星上「制造」出来，而在我们称为新星和超新星的爆炸中被喷吐出来的。正是因为天文学与物理学是这样密切相关，所以我们学下去时将要研究许多有关天文学的知识。

`*` 在这里我是讲得多么匆促啊！在这个简短的叙述中，每一句话包含了多么丰富的内容！「星体和地球都由同样的原子组成。」我通常挑选跟这一样的小题目来讲课。据诗人们说，科学使星星失去了美丽 —— 它们只不过是由气体原子组成的球体。但事实上远不是这么一回事。我也会在荒凉的夜晚仰望星空，并感受它们。但我看到的比诗人少还是更多呢？无垠的天空丰富了我的想象，我那小小的眼扫遍这回转的天穹，就能注视这欢乐的天空，并能捕获 100 万年前发出的星光。宇宙是一幅无边无际的图案 一一 我也是其中的一部分 —— 也许组成我的身体的材料正是从某个已被遗忘的星球上喷射出来的，就像现正在那儿喷射的某个星球一样。假若我通过帕洛玛（Palomar）的巨大眼晴「指安装在美国威尔逊（Wilson）山帕洛玛天文台的 200in 光学望远镜 —— 译者注」来观察夜空，那么就会看到原来或许紧靠在一起的星群从某个共同的起点往四面八方奔驰而去。宇宙的模式，或者说它的含义，它的成因是什么？人们对这些问题有点了解是不会有损于宇宙的奥秘的。真理远比以往任何艺术家的想象更为奇妙！为什么现在的诗人不去歌颂它？为什么如果朱庇特（木星）像一个人，诗人就会歌颂它，但如果朱庇特是一个由甲烷和氨组成的旋转的巨大球体，诗人就不作声了呢？

`*` 氦的英文名 helium 来自 Helios（太阳神）。—— 译者注

### 3.5 Geology

We turn now to what are called earth sciences, or geology. First, meteorology and the weather. Of course the instruments of meteorology are physical instru- ments, and the development of experimental physics made these instruments possible, as was explained before. However, the theory of meteorology has never been satisfactorily worked out by the physicist.「Well,」you say,「there is nothing but air, and we know the equations of the motions of air.」Yes we do.「So if we know the condition of air today, why can’t we ﬁgure out the condition of the air tomorrow?」First, we do not really know what the condition is today, because the air is swirling and twisting everywhere. It turns out to be very sensitive, and even unstable. If you have ever seen water run smoothly over a dam, and then turn into a large number of blobs and drops as it falls, you will understand what I mean by unstable. You know the condition of the water before it goes over the spillway; it is perfectly smooth; but the moment it begins to fall, where do the drops begin? What determines how big the lumps are going to be and where they will be? That is not known, because the water is unstable. Even a smooth moving mass of air, in going over a mountain turns into complex whirlpools and eddies. In many ﬁelds we ﬁnd this situation of turbulent ﬂow that we cannot analyze today. Quickly we leave the subject of weather, and discuss geology! The question basic to geology is, what makes the earth the way it is? The most obvious processes are in front of your very eyes, the erosion processes of the rivers, the winds, etc. It is easy enough to understand these, but for every bit of erosion there is an equal amount of something else going on. Mountains are no lower today, on the average, than they were in the past. There must be mountain-forming processes. You will ﬁnd, if you study geology, that there are mountain-forming processes and volcanism, which nobody understands but which is half of geology. The phenomenon of volcanoes is really not understood. What makes an earthquake is, ultimately, not understood. It is understood that if something is pushing something else, it snaps and will slide — that is all right. But what pushes, and why? The theory is that there are currents inside the earth — circulating currents, due to the diﬀerence in temperature inside and outside — which, in their motion, push the surface slightly. Thus if there are two opposite circulations next to each other, the matter will collect in the region where they meet and make belts of mountains which are in unhappy stressed conditions, and so produce volcanoes and earthquakes.

What about the inside of the earth? A great deal is known about the speed of earthquake waves through the earth and the density of distribution of the earth. However, physicists have been unable to get a good theory as to how dense a substance should be at the pressures that would be expected at the center of the earth. In other words, we cannot ﬁgure out the properties of matter very well in these circumstances. We do much less well with the earth than we do with the conditions of matter in the stars. The mathematics involved seems a little too diﬃcult, so far, but perhaps it will not be too long before someone realizes that it is an important problem, and really works it out. The other aspect, of course, is that even if we did know the density, we cannot ﬁgure out the circulating currents. Nor can we really work out the properties of rocks at high pressure. We cannot tell how fast the rocks should「give」; that must all be worked out by experiment.

3-5 地质学

我们现在转到所谓的地球科学或地质学。首先是气象学和天气。当然气象学的仪器是物理仪器，就像前面所说的那样，实验物理学的发展使得提供这些仪器成为可能。然而，物理学家从来没有得出满意的气象学理论。「怎么！」你们会说：「这里除了空气以外什么东西都没有，而我们已经知道了空气的运动方程。我们的确知道。「那么，如果我们知道了今天的空气状态，为什么就不能计算出明天的空气状态？」首先，我们并不真正知道今天的状态究竟是怎样的，因为空气到处旋转。结果它非常敏感，甚至不稳定。假如你们看到过水流平稳地流过水坝，然后当它下落时一下子变成大量的水珠和水滴的话，你就会懂得我所说的不稳定是什么意思了。你们知道水在流出溢水口之前的情况，它是十分平滑的；但是在它开始下落的一瞬间，水滴从哪里开始溅出？决定水滴将会有多大，并且在哪里的因素是什么？这些都无法知道，因为这里水是不稳定的。而对于空气来说，即使是平稳地运动着，但当它越过座山时就变成了复杂的旋涡。在许多领域中都出现这种湍流现象，我们在今天还无法对之进行分析。现在，赶快离开天气问题，回到地质学上去吧！

对于地质学而言，它的基本问题是，究竟是什么使地球成为现在这个样子？最明显的过程就在你们的眼前，这就是河流、风等的侵蚀过程。要理解这些事是相当容易的，但是要知道，对于每一片侵蚀都有等量的另外一些东西出现。平均而言，今天的山脉并不比过去的低，因此必定有一种造山过程。假如你们学过地质学，你们就会知道，确实存在着造山过程以及火山作用，这些现象没有人懂得，但却占了地质学的一半内容。实际上，火山的本质并没有被人们所理解。造成地震的原因是什么最终也未被人们所了解。我们所知道的是，如果一个东西推动另外一些东西，那么就会突然断裂，并且产生滑动，这当然是对的。但是什么东西在推？为什么会这样？有一种理论认为，在地球内部存在着环流，它是由于内外温度上的差别而造成的，也就是它们在运动过程中轻微地推着地球的表层，这样，假如有两股相对的环流在某个地方碰上的话，物质就会在这个区域里堆积起来而形成山脉，这些山脉处于非常不相宜的受到应力的状态，这样就会引起火山爆发，或造成地震。

那么地球内部的情况是怎样的呢？关于地震波在地球里的传播速度以及地球的密度分布已经了解得很多。然而，关于物质处于我们预期在地球中心所应有的压强之下会有怎样的密度，物理学家没有能够提出一种有效的理论。换句话说，我们还不能很好地解决在这种情况下的物质的性质问题。我们在地球方面所做的事比在星体的物质条件下所做的事要差得多。这里所包含的数学到现在为止看来似乎过于复杂，但是也许不要很长时间就会有人认识到这是一个重要的问题，并且着手解决这个问题。当然，另一方面，即使我们确实知道了密度，还是不能判断环流，也不能真正得知高压下的岩石的性质。我们无法说出岩石要多快才会「融化」，这必须通过实验来解决。

### 3.6 Psychology

Next, we consider the science of psychology.

Incidentally, psychoanalysis it is at best a medical process, and perhaps even more like is not a science:

witch-doctoring. It has a theory as to what causes disease — lots of diﬀerent「spirits,」etc. The witch doctor has a theory that a disease like malaria is caused by a spirit which comes into the air; it is not cured by shaking a snake over it, but quinine does help malaria. So, if you are sick, I would advise that you go to the witch doctor because he is the man in the tribe who knows the most about the disease; on the other hand, his knowledge is not science. Psychoanalysis has not been checked carefully by experiment, and there is no way to ﬁnd a list of the number of cases in which it works, the number of cases in which it does not work, etc.

The other branches of psychology, which involve things like the physiology of sensation — what happens in the eye, and what happens in the brain — are, if you wish, less interesting. But some small but real progress has been made in studying them. One of the most interesting technical problems may or may not be called psychology. The central problem of the mind, if you will, or the nervous system, is this: when an animal learns something, it can do something diﬀerent than it could before, and its brain cell must have changed too, if it is made out of atoms. In what way is it diﬀerent? We do not know where to look, or what to look for, when something is memorized. We do not know what it means, or what change there is in the nervous system, when a fact is learned. This is a very important problem which has not been solved at all. Assuming, however, that there is some kind of memory thing, the brain is such an enormous mass of interconnecting wires and nerves that it probably cannot be analyzed in a straightforward manner. There is an analog of this to computing machines and computing elements, in that they also have a lot of lines, and they have some kind of element, analogous, perhaps, to the synapse, or connection of one nerve to another. This is a very interesting subject which we have not the time to discuss further — the relationship between thinking and computing machines. It must be appreciated, of course, that this subject will tell us very little about the real complexities of ordinary human behavior. All human beings are so diﬀerent. It will be a long time before we get there. We must start much further back. If we could even ﬁgure out how a dog works, we would have gone pretty far. Dogs are easier to understand, but nobody yet knows how dogs work.

3-6 心理学

接下来，我们考虑心理科学。顺便提一下，心理分析并不是一门科学，它充其量不过是个医学过程，也许更像巫术。它有一个疾病起源的理论 —— 据说有许多不同的「幽灵」等。巫医有一个理论说，像疟疾那样的疾病是由进入空气中的幽灵所引起的，但是医治疟疾的药方并不是将一条蛇在病人头上晃动，而是奎宁。所以，如果你的身体感到有什么不舒服，我倒劝你到巫医那儿去，因为他是对疾病知道得最多的那批人中的一个。然而，他的知识不是种科学。心理分析没有用实验仔细地检验过，因此没有办法知道，在哪些情况下它是有效的，在哪些情况下则是无效的，等等。

心理学的其他一些分支，包括感觉的生理学 —— 在眼晴里出现一些什么情况，在大脑中出现一些什么情况 —— 可以说，是并不令人感到兴趣的。但是在它们的研究中取得了一些微小的然而是真正的进展。有一个最有趣的技术性问题可以归之为心理学，也可以不归之为心理学，即有关大脑 —— 如果你愿意的话，或者说神经系统的中心问题是：当某种动物学到了某件事后，它就能做一些以前不会做的事，所以它的大脑细胞也一定会有变化 一一 只要大脑细胞是由原子构成的。那么，差别表现在哪里呢？当一件事情被记在大脑里后，我们不知道在哪儿去找它，或者去找些什么东西。如果一件事情被学到了，它意味着什么？或者说神经系统有些什么变化？我们都不知道。这是一个很重要的问题，但根本没有解决。然而，假设存在着某种记忆的物质的话，那么大脑恰恰就是这么多的连线和神经的集合体，这种集合体大概是无法用简单的方式来分析的。这和计算机以及计算单元很类似，它们也有大量的布线，有某种单元，大概就类似于神经元触点，或者说一根神经到另一根神经的联结点。思维和计算机之间的联系是一个非常有趣的课题，但我们在这里没有时间作进一步的讨论。当然，必须懂得，这个课题在有关人们一般行为的真正复杂性上所告诉我们的东西是非常之少的。人与人之间存在着如此巨大的差别，为了要达到那种理解将需要很长的时间，我们必须把研究起点退到更后面的地方。假如我们总算能够解决狗是怎样活动的，我们就已经走得够远了。狗是比较容易理解的，但是今天还没有一个人懂得狗是怎样活动的。

### 3.7 How did it get that way?

In order for physics to be useful to other sciences in a theoretical way, other than in the invention of instruments, the science in question must supply to the physicist a description of the object in a physicist’s language. They can say「why does a frog jump?,」and the physicist cannot answer. If they tell him what a frog is, that there are so many molecules, there is a nerve here, etc., that is diﬀerent. If they will tell us, more or less, what the earth or the stars are like, then we can ﬁgure it out. In order for physical theory to be of any use, we must know where the atoms are located. In order to understand the chemistry, we must know exactly what atoms are present, for otherwise we cannot analyze it. That is but one limitation, of course.

There is another kind of problem in the sister sciences which does not exist in physics; we might call it, for lack of a better term, the historical question. How did it get that way? If we understand all about biology, we will want to know how all the things which are on the earth got there. There is the theory of evolution, an important part of biology. In geology, we not only want to know how the mountains are forming, but how the entire earth was formed in the beginning, the origin of the solar system, etc. That, of course, leads us to want to know what kind of matter there was in the world. How did the stars evolve? What were the initial conditions? That is the problem of astronomical history. A great deal has been found out about the formation of stars, the formation of elements from which we were made, and even a little about the origin of the universe.

There is no historical question being studied in physics at the present time. We do not have a question,「Here are the laws of physics, how did they get that way?」We do not imagine, at the moment, that the laws of physics are somehow changing with time, that they were diﬀerent in the past than they are at present. Of course they may be, and the moment we ﬁnd they are, the historical question of physics will be wrapped up with the rest of the history of the universe, and then the physicist will be talking about the same problems as astronomers, geologists, and biologists.

Finally, there is a physical problem that is common to many ﬁelds, that is very old, and that has not been solved. It is not the problem of ﬁnding new fundamental particles, but something left over from a long time ago — over a hundred years. Nobody in physics has really been able to analyze it mathematically satisfactorily in spite of its importance to the sister sciences. It is the analysis of circulating or turbulent ﬂuids. If we watch the evolution of a star, there comes a point where we can deduce that it is going to start convection, and thereafter we can no longer deduce what should happen. A few million years later the star explodes, but we cannot ﬁgure out the reason. We cannot analyze the weather. We do not know the patterns of motions that there should be inside the earth. The simplest form of the problem is to take a pipe that is very long and push water through it at high speed. We ask: to push a given amount of water through that pipe, how much pressure is needed? No one can analyze it from ﬁrst principles and the properties of water. If the water ﬂows very slowly, or if we use a thick goo like honey, then we can do it nicely. You will ﬁnd that in your textbook. What we really cannot do is deal with actual, wet water running through a pipe. That is the central problem which we ought to solve some day, and we have not.

A poet once said,「The whole universe is in a glass of wine.」We will probably never know in what sense he meant that, for poets do not write to be understood. But it is true that if we look at a glass of wine closely enough we see the entire universe. There are the things of physics: the twisting liquid which evaporates depending on the wind and weather, the reﬂections in the glass, and our imagination adds the atoms. The glass is a distillation of the earth’s rocks, and in its composition we see the secrets of the universe’s age, and the evolution of stars. What strange array of chemicals are in the wine? How did they come to be? There are the ferments, the enzymes, the substrates, and the products. There in wine is found the great generalization: all life is fermentation. Nobody can discover the chemistry of wine without discovering, as did Louis Pasteur, the cause of much disease. How vivid is the claret, pressing its existence into the consciousness that watches it! If our small minds, for some convenience, divide this glass of wine, this universe, into parts — physics, biology, geology, astronomy, psychology, and so on — remember that nature does not know it! So let us put it all back together, not forgetting ultimately what it is for. Let it give us one more ﬁnal pleasure: drink it and forget it all!

3-7 情况何以会如此

为了使物理学不仅在仪器的发明方面，而且在理论方面对其他科学也有所裨益，有关的科学就必须向物理学家提供用物理学家的语言描述的研究对象。人们或许会问：「青蛙为什么会跳跃？」物理学家对此就回答不出。如果人们告诉他青蛙是什么，这里有这么多的分子那里有神经，等等，情况就不同了。假如人们或多或少地告诉我们地球或者星星是怎样的，那么我们就能够把它们想象出来。要使物理理论有点用处，我们就必须知道原子的位置。要理解化学，就应当确切知道存在着哪些原子，不然就无法分析。当然，这只是限制因素之一。

在物理学的姐妹科学中存在着另一种物理学中不存在的问题，因为没有更好的措辞，我们可以称它为历史问题。情况何以会如此？假如我们懂得了生物学的一切，就会想要知道现在地球上的所有生物是怎样发展过来的。这就是生物学的一个重要部分 —— 进化论。在地质学中，我们不仅要知道山脉正在怎样形成，而且要知道整个地球最初是怎样形成的，太阳系的起源，等等。当然，这就会使我们想要知道在宇宙的彼时有什么样的物质。恒星是怎样演化的？初始状态又是如何？这些都是天体的历史问题。今天我们已经弄清楚许多有关恒星的形成及有关组成我们身体的元素的形成的知识，甚至还知道一些有关宇宙起源的事。

目前在物理学中还没有这种历史问题要研究。我们不会问：「这里是物理学的定律，它们是怎样变化而来的？」我们此刻不去想象物理定律以某种方式随时间而变化，不认为它们在过去与现在是有差别的。当然，不能排除这种可能，而且我们一旦发现果真如此，物理学的历史问题就将与宇宙发展的其余历史问题交织在一起，于是物理学家就要谈论天文学家地质学家和生物学家同样的问题。

最后，在许多领域中普遍存在着一个物理问题，这是一个很古老的问题，但是还没有得到解决。这并不是寻找新的基本粒子的问题，而是好久之前 一一 大约 100 多年前就遗留下来的一件事情。在物理学上没有一个人能够真正令人满意地对它进行数学的分析，尽管它对于姐妹科学来说是一个重要问题。这就是环流或湍流的分析。如果我们注视着一个恒星的演化，就会发现这样的情形，我们就可以推断出将要出现对流，但在这以后我们就再也无法推断会有什么事发生了。几百万年后这个星体会发生爆炸，但是我们想不出是什么道理。我们不能分析气候，他不知道地球内部的运动。这类问题的最简单的形式就是取一根很长的管子，使水高速通过。我们问：使一定量的水通过管子需要多大的压力？没有人能从基本原理和水的性质出发来分析它。如果水流得非常慢，或者用的是蜂蜜那样的黏性物质，那么我们可以分析得很不错。在你们的教科书上就有这方面的内容。我们真正不能处理的是实际的水流过管子的问题。这是一个我们有朝一日应当解决的中心问题，但是现在还没有解决。

有一位诗人曾经说过：「整个宇宙就存在于一杯葡萄酒中。」我们大概永远不可能知道他是在什么含义上这样说的，因为诗人的写作并不是为了被理解。但是真实的情况是，当我们十分接近地观察一杯葡萄酒时，我们可以见到整个宇宙。这里出现了一些物理学的现象：弯弯的液面，它的蒸发取决于天气和风；玻璃上的反射；而在我们的想象中又添加了原子。玻璃是地球上的岩石的净化产物，在它的成分中我们可以发现地球的年龄和星体演化的秘密。葡萄酒中所包含的种种化学制品的奇特排列是怎样的？它们是怎样产生的？这里有酵素、基质以及它们的生成物。于是在葡萄酒中就发现了伟大的概括：整个生命就是发酵。任何研究葡萄酒的化学的人也必然会像巴斯德（L. Pasteur）所做过的那样发现许多疾病的原因。红葡萄酒是多么的鲜艳！让它深深地留在人们美好的记忆中去吧！如果我们微不足道的有限智力为了某种方便将这杯葡萄酒 一一 这个宇宙 一一 分为几个部分：物理学、生物学、地质学天文学、心理学，等等，那么要记住，大自然是并不知道这一切的。所以让我们把所有这些仍旧归并在一起，并且不要忘记这杯酒最终是干什么用的。让它最后再给我们一次快乐吧！喝掉它，然后把它完全忘掉！
