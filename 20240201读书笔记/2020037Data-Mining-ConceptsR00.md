这本书的主题核心，就是最大的反常识卡，并且注意时间脉络。

### 0201. 术语卡 —— Data Mining

Data mining, also popularly referred to as knowledge discovery from data (KDD), is the automated or convenient extraction of patterns representing knowledge implicitly stored or captured in large databases, data warehouses, the Web, other massive information repositories, or data streams.

What Is Data Mining? It is no surprise that data mining, as a truly interdisciplinary subject, can be defined in many different ways. To refer to the mining of gold from rocks or sand, we say gold mining instead of rock or sand mining. Analogously, data mining should have been more appropriately named「knowledge mining from data,」which is unfortunately somewhat long. However, the shorter term, knowledge mining may not reflect the emphasis on mining from large amounts of data. Nevertheless, mining is a vivid term characterizing the process that finds a small set of precious nuggets from a great deal of raw material (Figure 1.3). Thus, such a misnomer carrying both「data」and「mining」became a popular choice. In addition, many other terms have a similar meaning to data mining — for example, knowledge mining from data, knowledge extraction, data/pattern analysis, data archaeology, and data dredging.

### 0202. 术语卡 —— KDD 的基本步骤

Many people treat data mining as a synonym for another popularly used term, knowledge discovery from data, or KDD, while others view data mining as merely an essential step in the process of knowledge discovery. The knowledge discovery process is shown in Figure 1.4 as an iterative sequence of the following steps:

1 Data cleaning (to remove noise and inconsistent data).

2 Data integration (where multiple data sources may be combined). 3

3 Data selection (where data relevant to the analysis task are retrieved from the database).

4 Data transformation (where data are transformed and consolidated into forms appropriate for mining by performing summary or aggregation operations). 4

5 Data mining (an essential process where intelligent methods are applied to extract data patterns).

6 Pattern evaluation (to identify the truly interesting patterns representing knowledge based on interestingness measures — see Section 1.4.6).

7 Knowledge presentation (where visualization and knowledge representation techniques are used to present mined knowledge to users).

### 0203. 术语卡 —— data warehouse 

 A data warehouse is a repository of information collected from multiple sources, stored under a unified schema, and usually residing at a single site. Data warehouses are constructed via a process of data cleaning, data integration, data transformation, data loading, and periodic data refreshing. This process is discussed in Chapter 3 and Chapter 4. Figure 1.6 shows the typical framework for construction and use of a data warehouse for AllElectronics.

### 0204. 术语卡 —— data cube

A data warehouse is usually modeled by a multidimensional data structure, called a data cube, in which each dimension corresponds to an attribute or a set of attributes in the schema, and each cell stores the value of some aggregate measure such as count or sum(sales_amount). A data cube provides a multidimensional view of data and allows the precomputation and fast access of summarized data.

A data cube for AllElectronics. A data cube for summarized sales data of AllElectronics is presented in Figure 1.7(a). The cube has three dimensions: address (with city values Chicago, New York, Toronto, Vancouver), time (with quarter values Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4), and item (with item type values: home entertainment, computer, phone, security). The aggregate value stored in each cell of the cube is sales_amount (in thousands). For example, the total sales for the first quarter, Q1, for the items related to security systems in Vancouver is \$400,000, as stored in cell 〈Vancouver, Q1, security〉. Additional cubes may be used to store aggregate sums over each dimension, corresponding to the aggregate values obtained using different SQL group-bys (e.g., the total sales amount per city and quarter, or per city and item, or per quarter and item, or per each individual dimension).

### 0205. 术语卡 —— OLAP

By providing multidimensional data views and the precomputation of summarized data, data warehouse systems can provide inherent support for OLAP. Online analytical processing operations make use of background knowledge regarding the domain of the data being studied to allow the presentation of data at different levels of abstraction. Such operations accommodate different user viewpoints. Examples of OLAP operations include drill-down and roll-up, which allow the user to view the data at differing degrees of summarization, as illustrated in Figure 1.7(b). For instance, we can drill down on sales data summarized by quarter to see data summarized by month. Similarly, we can roll up on sales data summarized by city to view data summarized by country.

Although data warehouse tools help support data analysis, additional tools for data mining are often needed for in-depth analysis. Multidimensional data mining (also called exploratory multidimensional data mining) performs data mining in multidimensional space in an OLAP style. That is, it allows the exploration of multiple combinations of dimensions at varying levels of granularity in data mining, and thus has greater potential for discovering interesting patterns representing knowledge. An overview of data warehouse and OLAP technology is provided in Chapter 4. Advanced issues regarding data cube computation and multidimensional data mining are discussed in Chapter 5.

### 0206. 术语卡 —— Transactional Data

Transactional Data. In general, each record in a transactional database captures a transaction, such as a customer's purchase, a flight booking, or a user's clicks on a web page. A transaction typically includes a unique transaction identity number (trans_ID) and a list of the items making up the transaction, such as the items purchased in the transaction. A transactional database may have additional tables, which contain other information related to the transactions, such as item description, information about the salesperson or the branch, and so on.

1『事物数据的概念。事务数据库的每个记录代表一个事务，如顾客的一次购物、一个航班订票或一个用户的网页点击。通常，一个事务包含一个唯一的事务标识号（trans_ID），以及个组成事务的项（如，交易中购买的商品）的列表。事务数据库可能有一些与之相关联的附加表，包含关于事务的其他信息，如商品描述、关于销售人员或部门等的信息。』

A transactional database for AllElectronics. Transactions can be stored in a table, with one record per transaction. A fragment of a transactional database for AllElectronics is shown in Figure 1.8. From the relational database point of view, the sales table in the figure is a nested relation because the attribute list_of_item_IDs contains a set of items. Because most relational database systems do not support nested relational structures, the transactional database is usually either stored in a flat file in a format similar to the table in Figure 1.8 or unfolded into a standard relation in a format similar to the items_sold table in Figure 1.5.

1『由于大部分关系数据库系统都不支持嵌套关系结构，事务数据库通常存放在一个类似于图 1.8 中的表格式的平面文件中，或展开到类似于图 1.5 的 iems_sold 表的标准关系中。』

## 书评

### 04

致力于挖掘体系的构建，而非某个算法！对于刚入门数据挖掘的人来说，这书绝对会让你感觉自己是个折翼的天使。因为一开始就各种各样的理论扑面而来，而对于那些经典的算法却只是做一个感性的介绍，并没有那种流程图式的清晰解说。总之就是，不易上手。但是在这种不面善的情况，为什么该书却被国内外奉为经典，而作者也备受各方专家推崇呢？而纠结一段时间，在注意到一个问题后也就开始领悟了。在目前的挖掘领域最难的并不是那些个算法，就跟当年数据库理论刚出来一样，算法与运用设想上可谓是热闹非凡，但是在商界却并没有真正的将其实践化，为什么？！就因为那些个理论都忘记了关键的一点，数据库要怎么做！只知道做好了可以怎样那就相当于是纸上谈兵。于是乎，在这种虚空的「狂热」过了很久，直到 1976 年 —— Peter P.S Chen 博士提出的关系型数据库才真正使这些领先于潮流者得以实现。

而无独有偶，现在数据挖掘貌似面临着相似的问题。各类挖掘算法和畅想的著述可谓是汗牛充栋，但却都不自觉地在回避两个问题：1）每一门学科都肯定尤其综述谱系，而对于数据挖掘，尤其是面对各种新型挖掘的出现，这个谱该怎么弄，又是什么？2）为什么数据挖掘喊了这么多年的口号，其推广却并没有像宣传的那样给科技带来很多实质性的改变？

我想，这本书也正是在致力于解决这两个问题吧。作者参照历史经验，结合自己的认识将整个挖掘理论进行系统化的整理。这是件很了不起但确实「巧合」的事，因为想做的人不一定能被别人认可，而能做的又不一定有时间，而韩也算是刚好赶上了。正如其所言，做研究就要去尝试发现蓝海，那样才能有大收获，才能有绝对的话语权。我想这句话的另一层理解可以是，就算他不去做，也早晚会有人去弄的。

还有就是数据挖掘的实质推广性了。先不说其网站上的各种科研实践课题，但就其认识与分析整个挖掘发展的瓶颈与趋势来看，这是其他书所不能及的。该书并没有沉溺于各种算法间不可自拔，也就没有画出流程图，作者只是在试图讲清算法原理的情况，更注重对各种算法的产生原因 —— 问题进行详述，让读者读完之后不会陷入各种纠结的算法步骤中，而是能够对整个挖掘进行深刻的认识。

任何事情都是双面的，而也没有一本书能够适用于所有人，这书也就不例外。对于初学者，其虽然有系统的论述，但是还是得花一番气力来细读的。而对于实践者，当涉及到某个具体算法的实现时，这书也不适合，因为毫无实现的提示，只能算是给出了一个解决方法概述。当然如果真需要的话，还是可以按他的推荐来寻找更详细的说明的。翻译的很差劲，看不出教授的水平。

### 09

一本引导你入门的书，知识深浅都涵盖，描述广泛但不详实易懂。前几个 chapter 屁话较多，但 OLAP 的概念是有用的。随后的 cluster，association 的分析解释还是涵盖的很好，但都是点到为止，颇具教科书的味道，其实被来就是一本教科书。剩下的章节就不能看了。6 年前就通读此书（2007 年），觉得很深，随后几年翻翻，发现的一个缺点是应用性不强。比如 association 分析，如何更好应用于行业，是值得思考的。

### 14

这本书是刚上研究生的时候开始看的，这本书介绍的数据挖掘基本上是从数据库的概念出发的，对各种算法都有提及，但是很多算法基本上是语焉不详，对于刚开始学习数据挖掘和机器学习的学生来说，能对数据挖掘的基本概念有所了解，对算法也只能了解个大概了。如果不是纯搞数据仓库 + 挖掘，个人更推荐刘兵的《WEB Data Mining》。Bishop 大神的《Pattern Recognition And Machine Learning》。

### 15

很高兴看到这本书的作者之一 Jiawei Han 是中国人，先自豪一下。这本书最大的特点就是概念性强（相对于《数据挖掘中的实用机器学习工具及技术》），从数据仓库到关联规则，从聚类到神经网络，最后几个章节还有数据挖掘技术的热门应用介绍。总的来说，作者希望覆盖数据挖掘技术的方方面面的应用，也尽量将概念讲的详细。这个目标算是基本上达到了。但是这本书不能算是一本经典的数据挖掘介绍书籍。为什么呢？首先，过分的追求「全」就会让人分散注意力，比如书中关于 outlier detection 讲解了很多算法，但是都不详细，不过还好在书后的引用中找到相关论文。另外，这本书中规中矩，而让我感觉出彩的方面不多（或许是我要求太高？我不知道）。

数据挖掘还在迅猛发展，所以打算写本好书的家伙们好好考虑一下吧！PS：说点不太相关的，谁能推荐一本关于模式识别的书？请不要推荐 Bishop 的《机器学习和模式识别》以及《模式分类》，我希望书籍跟读者的距离更近点，《模式分类》还没怎么看，不过 Bishop 大神的书数学公式实在太多。

### 17

数据挖掘功能包括发现概念 / 类描述、关联、分类、预测、聚类、趋势分析、偏差分析和类似性分析。特征化和区分是数据汇总的形式。数据分类 (data classification) 是一个两步过程：1）建立一个模型，描述预定的数据类集或概念集。通过分析由属性描述的数据库元组来构造模型。2）使用模型进行分类。「预测和分类有何不同？」预测（prediction）是构造和使用模型评估无标号样本类，或评估给定样本可能具有的属性值或值区间。在这种观点下，分类和回归是两类主要预测问题，其中分类是预测离散或标称值，而回归用于预测连续或有序值。然而，我们的观点是：用预测法预测类标号为分类，用预测法预测连续值（例如使用回归方法）为预测。这种观点在数据挖掘界被广泛接受。

chp7 用判断树归纳分类。判断树（decision tree）是一个类似流程图的树结构，气质每个内部节点表示在一个属性上的测试，每个分支代表一个测试输出，而每个树叶节点代表类或者类分布。chp8 聚类分析。将物理或抽象对象的集合分组成为由类似的对象组成的多个类的过程被称为聚类。聚类的方法有：1）划分方法 partitioning method；2) 层次方法 hierarchical method；3) 基于密度的方法 density-based method；4）基于网格的方法 grid-based method；5）基于模型的方法 model-based method。

## 译者序

数据挖掘是数据库研究、开发和应用最活跃的分支之一。这是很自然的事。数据库系统，特别是关系数据库系统的成功，使得我们有了强有力的事务处理工具。在计算机的帮助下，人们可以把传统的事务处理做得更好。不满足现状是社会前进的动力。人类当然不会仅仅满足于让计算机做事务处理。从信息处理的角度，人们更希望计算机帮助分析数据和理解数据，帮助他们基于丰富的数据做出决策。于是，数据挖掘（从大量数据中以非平凡的方法发现有用的知识）就成为一种自然的需求。正是这种需求引起了人们的关注，导致了数据挖掘研究和应用的蓬勃发展。

数据挖掘是一个多学科的交叉领域。这也是很自然的事。一方面，想要以非平凡的方法发现藴疲在大型数据集中的有用知识，数据挖掘必须从统计学、机器学习、神经网络、模式识别、知识库系统、信息检索、高性能计算和可视化等学科领域汲取营养。另一方面，这些学科领域也需要从不同角度关注数据的分析与理解；数据挖掘也为这些学科领域的发展提供了新的机遇和挑战。今天，数据挖掘已经不再仅仅是数据库的研究者和开发者关注的问题它已经成为统计学、机器学习等诸多领域的研究者和开发者的热点课题之一。这种学科交叉融合带来的良性互动，无疑促进了包括数据挖掘在内的诸学科的发展与繁荣。

过去的 11 年是数据挖掘研究与应用迅猛发展的 11 年：新的和改进的算法不断出现，所考察的数据类型日趋丰富，应用领域逐渐扩大。虽然所挖掘的基本知识类型并未增加很多，但是新的应用需要我们处理更加丰富的数据类型，如流、序列、图、时间序列、符号序列、生物学序列、空间、音频、图像和视频数据，因此需要新的技术。例如，流数据的关联、分类和聚类需要处理可能无限的数据，需要考虑数据的分布随时间的演变。Web 页面的分类不仅需要考虑页面本身的特征，而且还需要考虑页面的链接和被链接的页面的特征。

第 3 版对本书的前两版进行了全面修订，突出和加强了数据挖掘的核心内容，以足够的广度和深度涵盖该领域的核心内容。认识数据和数据预处理、数据仓库和 OLAP 技术、模式挖掘与关联分析、分类、聚类都分成两章。其中，前一章介绍基本概念和技术，后一章进步讨论更高级的概念和方法。离群点检测单独成为一章，进行更深入的讨论。最后一章对数据挖掘研究与应用发展趋势进行了概述，把读者引向更深入的主题。与前两版相比，第 3 版的组织更有利于教学。

## Foreword

The problem then becomes how to analyze the data. This is exactly the focus of this Third Edition of the book. Jiawei, Micheline, and Jian give encyclopedic coverage of all the related methods, from the classic topics of clustering and classification, to database methods (e.g., association rules, data cubes) to more recent and advanced topics (e.g., SVD/PCA, wavelets, support vector machines).

The exposition is extremely accessible to beginners and advanced readers alike. The book gives the fundamental material first and the more advanced material in follow-up chapters. It also has numerous rhetorical questions, which I found extremely helpful for maintaining focus.

We have used the first two editions as textbooks in data mining courses at Carnegie Mellon and plan to continue to do so with this Third Edition. The new version has significant additions: Notably, it has more than 100 citations to works from 2006 onward, focusing on more recent material such as graphs and social networks, sensor networks, and outlier detection. This book has a new section for visualization, has expanded outlier detection into a whole chapter, and has separate chapters for advanced methods — for example, pattern mining with top-k patterns and more and clustering methods with biclustering and graph clustering. Overall, it is an excellent book on classic and modern data mining methods, and it is ideal not only for teaching but also as a reference book.

We are deluged by data — scientific data, medical data, demographic data, financial data, and marketing data. People have no time to look at this data. Human attention has become the precious resource. So, we must find ways to automatically analyze the data, to automatically classify it, to automatically summarize it, to automatically discover and characterize trends in it, and to automatically flag anomalies. This is one of the most active and exciting areas of the database research community. Researchers in areas including statistics, visualization, artificial intelligence, and machine learning are contributing to this field. The breadth of the field makes it difficult to grasp the extraordinary progress over the last few decades.

1『 automatically flag anomalies 自动标记异常。』

The field has matured with many new and improved algorithms, and has broadened to include many more datatypes: streams, sequences, graphs, time-series, geospatial, audio, images, and video. We are certainly not at the end of the golden age — indeed research and commercial interest in data mining continues to grow — but we are all fortunate to have this modern compendium.

The book gives quick introductions to database and data mining concepts with particular emphasis on data analysis. It then covers in a chapter-by-chapter tour the concepts and techniques that underlie classification, prediction, association, and clustering. These topics are presented with examples, a tour of the best algorithms for each problem class, and with pragmatic rules of thumb about when to apply each technique. The Socratic presentation style is both very readable and very informative.

## Preface

The computerization of our society has substantially enhanced our capabilities for both generating and collecting data from diverse sources. A tremendous amount of data has flooded almost every aspect of our lives. This explosive growth in stored or transient data has generated an urgent need for new techniques and automated tools that can intelligently assist us in transforming the vast amounts of data into useful information and knowledge. This has led to the generation of a promising and flourishing frontier in computer science called data mining, and its various applications. Data mining, also popularly referred to as knowledge discovery from data (KDD), is the automated or convenient extraction of patterns representing knowledge implicitly stored or captured in large databases, data warehouses, the Web, other massive information repositories, or data streams.

1『上面最后一行信息是对「数据挖掘」的定义。』

This book explores the concepts and techniques of knowledge discovery and data mining. As a multidisciplinary field, data mining draws on work from areas including statistics, machine learning, pattern recognition, database technology, information retrieval, network science, knowledge-based systems, artificial intelligence, high-performance computing, and data visualization. We focus on issues relating to the feasibility, usefulness, effectiveness, and scalability of techniques for the discovery of patterns hidden in large data sets. As a result, this book is not intended as an introduction to statistics, machine learning, database systems, or other such areas, although we do provide some background knowledge to facilitate the reader's comprehension of their respective roles in data mining. Rather, the book is a comprehensive introduction to data mining.

1『information retrieval 信息检索；数据挖掘的核心是发现模式 patterns。』

Data mining emerged during the late 1980s, made great strides during the 1990s, and continues to flourish into the new millennium. This book presents an overall picture of the field, introducing interesting data mining techniques and systems and discussing applications and research directions. An important motivation for writing this book was the need to build an organized framework for the study of data mining — a challenging task, owing to the extensive multidisciplinary nature of this fast-developing field. We hope that this book will encourage people with different backgrounds and experiences to exchange their views regarding data mining so as to contribute toward the further promotion and shaping of this exciting and dynamic field.

Organization of the Book. Since the publication of the first two editions of this book, great progress has been made in the field of data mining. Many new data mining methodologies, systems, and applications have been developed, especially for handling new kinds of data, including information networks, graphs, complex structures, and data streams, as well as text, Web, multimedia, time-series, and spatiotemporal data. Such fast development and rich, new technical contents make it difficult to cover the full spectrum of the field in a single book. Instead of continuously expanding the coverage of this book, we have decided to cover the core material in sufficient scope and depth, and leave the handling of complex data types to a separate forthcoming book.

1『 spatiotemporal data 时间空间数据。』

The core technical material, which handles mining on general data types, is expanded and substantially enhanced. Several individual chapters for topics from the second edition (e.g., data preprocessing, frequent pattern mining, classification, and clustering) are now augmented and each split into two chapters for this new edition. For these topics, one chapter encapsulates the basic concepts and techniques while the other presents advanced concepts and methods.

Chapters from the second edition on mining complex data types (e.g., stream data, sequence data, graph-structured data, social network data, and multirelational data, as well as text, Web, multimedia, and spatiotemporal data) are now reserved for a new book that will be dedicated to advanced topics in data mining. Still, to support readers in learning such advanced topics, we have placed an electronic version of the relevant chapters from the second edition onto the book's web site as companion material for the third edition. The chapters of the third edition are described briefly as follows, with emphasis on the new material.

Chapter 1 provides an introduction to the multidisciplinary field of data mining. It discusses the evolutionary path of information technology, which has led to the need for data mining, and the importance of its applications. It examines the data types to be mined, including relational, transactional, and data warehouse data, as well as complex data types such as time-series, sequences, data streams, spatiotemporal data, multimedia data, text data, graphs, social networks, and Web data. The chapter presents a general classification of data mining tasks, based on the kinds of knowledge to be mined, the kinds of technologies used, and the kinds of applications that are targeted. Finally, major challenges in the field are discussed.

1『 transactional data 事务型数据；warehouse data 仓库数据。』

Chapter 2 introduces the general data features. It first discusses data objects and attribute types and then introduces typical measures for basic statistical data descriptions. It overviews data visualization techniques for various kinds of data. In addition to methods of numeric data visualization, methods for visualizing text, tags, graphs, and multidimensional data are introduced. Chapter 2 also introduces ways to measure similarity and dissimilarity for various kinds of data.

Chapter 3 introduces techniques for data preprocessing. It first introduces the concept of data quality and then discusses methods for data cleaning, data integration, data reduction, data transformation, and data discretization.

1『 data discretization 数据离散化。』

Chapter 4 and Chapter 5 provide a solid introduction to data warehouses, OLAP (online analytical processing), and data cube technology. Chapter 4 introduces the basic concepts, modeling, design architectures, and general implementations of data warehouses and OLAP, as well as the relationship between data warehousing and other data generalization methods. Chapter 5 takes an in-depth look at data cube technology, presenting a detailed study of methods of data cube computation, including Star-Cubing and high-dimensional OLAP methods. Further explorations of data cube and OLAP technologies are discussed, such as sampling cubes, ranking cubes, prediction cubes, multifeature cubes for complex analysis queries, and discovery-driven cube exploration.

Chapter 6 and Chapter 7 present methods for mining frequent patterns, associations, and correlations in large data sets. Chapter 6 introduces fundamental concepts, such as market basket analysis, with many techniques for frequent itemset mining presented in an organized way. These range from the basic Apriori algorithm and its variations to more advanced methods that improve efficiency, including the frequent pattern growth approach, frequent pattern mining with vertical data format, and mining closed and max frequent itemsets. The chapter also discusses pattern evaluation methods and introduces measures for mining correlated patterns. Chapter 7 is on advanced pattern mining methods. It discusses methods for pattern mining in multilevel and multidimensional space, mining rare and negative patterns, mining colossal patterns and high-dimensional data, constraint-based pattern mining, and mining compressed or approximate patterns. It also introduces methods for pattern exploration and application, including semantic annotation of frequent patterns.

1『 6、7 章是频繁模式、关联分析和相关性分析算法；8、9 章是分类分析算法；10、11 章是聚类分析算法。』

Chapter 8 and Chapter 9 describe methods for data classification. Due to the importance and diversity of classification methods, the contents are partitioned into two chapters. Chapter 8 introduces basic concepts and methods for classification, including decision tree induction, Bayes classification, and rule-based classification. It also discusses model evaluation and selection methods and methods for improving classification accuracy, including ensemble methods and how to handle imbalanced data. Chapter 9 discusses advanced methods for classification, including Bayesian belief networks, the neural network technique of backpropagation, support vector machines, classification using frequent patterns, k-nearest-neighbor classifiers, case-based reasoning, genetic algorithms, rough set theory, and fuzzy set approaches. Additional topics include multiclass classification, semi-supervised classification, active learning, and transfer learning.

Cluster analysis forms the topic of Chapter 10 and Chapter 11. Chapter 10 introduces the basic concepts and methods for data clustering, including an overview of basic cluster analysis methods, partitioning methods, hierarchical methods, density-based methods, and grid-based methods. It also introduces methods for the evaluation of clustering. Chapter 11 discusses advanced methods for clustering, including probabilistic model-based clustering, clustering high-dimensional data, clustering graph and network data, and clustering with constraints.

Chapter 12 is dedicated to outlier detection. It introduces the basic concepts of outliers and outlier analysis and discusses various outlier detection methods from the view of degree of supervision (i.e., supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised methods), as well as from the view of approaches (i.e., statistical methods, proximity-based methods, clustering-based methods, and classification-based methods). It also discusses methods for mining contextual and collective outliers, and for outlier detection in high-dimensional data.

1『 outlier detection 离群点检测，设计「监督」的算法。』

Finally, in Chapter 13, we discuss trends, applications, and research frontiers in data mining. We briefly cover mining complex data types, including mining sequence data (e.g., time series, symbolic sequences, and biological sequences), mining graphs and networks, and mining spatial, multimedia, text, and Web data. In-depth treatment of data mining methods for such data is left to a book on advanced topics in data mining, the writing of which is in progress. The chapter then moves ahead to cover other data mining methodologies, including statistical data mining, foundations of data mining, visual and audio data mining, as well as data mining applications. It discusses data mining for financial data analysis, for industries like retail and telecommunication, for use in science and engineering, and for intrusion detection and prevention. It also discusses the relationship between data mining and recommender systems. Because data mining is present in many aspects of daily life, we discuss issues regarding data mining and society, including ubiquitous and invisible data mining, as well as privacy, security, and the social impacts of data mining. We conclude our study by looking at data mining trends.

1『 intrusion detection and prevention 入侵检测和预防，信用卡防盗应该就属于此类。』

This book has several strong features that set it apart from other texts on data mining. It presents a very broad yet in-depth coverage of the principles of data mining. The chapters are written to be as self-contained as possible, so they may be read in order of interest by the reader. Advanced chapters offer a larger-scale view and may be considered optional for interested readers. All of the major methods of data mining are presented. The book presents important topics in data mining regarding multidimensional OLAP analysis, which is often overlooked or minimally treated in other data mining books. The book also maintains web sites with a number of online resources to aid instructors, students, and professionals in the field. These are described further in the following.

To the Student. We hope that this textbook will spark your interest in the young yet fast-evolving field of data mining. We have attempted to present the material in a clear manner, with careful explanation of the topics covered. Each chapter ends with a summary describing the main points. We have included many figures and illustrations throughout the text to make the book more enjoyable and reader-friendly. Although this book was designed as a textbook, we have tried to organize it so that it will also be useful to you as a reference book or handbook, should you later decide to perform in-depth research in the related fields or pursue a career in data mining. What do you need to know to read this book?

■ You should have some knowledge of the concepts and terminology associated with statistics, database systems, and machine learning. However, we do try to provide enough background of the basics, so that if you are not so familiar with these fields or your memory is a bit rusty, you will not have trouble following the discussions in the book.

■ You should have some programming experience. In particular, you should be able to read pseudocode and understand simple data structures such as multidimensional arrays.

To the Professional. This book was designed to cover a wide range of topics in the data mining field. As a result, it is an excellent handbook on the subject. Because each chapter is designed to be as standalone as possible, you can focus on the topics that most interest you. The book can be used by application programmers and information service managers who wish to learn about the key ideas of data mining on their own. The book would also be useful for technical data analysis staff in banking, insurance, medicine, and retailing industries who are interested in applying data mining solutions to their businesses. Moreover, the book may serve as a comprehensive survey of the data mining field, which may also benefit researchers who would like to advance the state-of-the-art in data mining and extend the scope of data mining applications.

The techniques and algorithms presented are of practical utility. Rather than selecting algorithms that perform well on small「toy」data sets, the algorithms described in the book are geared for the discovery of patterns and knowledge hidden in large, real data sets. Algorithms presented in the book are illustrated in pseudocode. The pseudocode is similar to the C programming language, yet is designed so that it should be easy to follow by programmers unfamiliar with C or C++. If you wish to implement any of the algorithms, you should find the translation of our pseudocode into the programming language of your choice to be a fairly straightforward task.

## 0101. Introduction

### Summary

■ Necessity is the mother of invention. With the mounting growth of data in every application, data mining meets the imminent need for effective, scalable, and flexible data analysis in our society. Data mining can be considered as a natural evolution of information technology and a confluence of several related disciplines and application domains.

■ Data mining is the process of discovering interesting patterns from massive amounts of data. As a knowledge discovery process, it typically involves data cleaning, data integration, data selection, data transformation, pattern discovery, pattern evaluation, and knowledge presentation.

■ A pattern is interesting if it is valid on test data with some degree of certainty, novel, potentially useful (e.g., can be acted on or validates a hunch about which the user was curious), and easily understood by humans. Interesting patterns represent knowledge. Measures of pattern interestingness, either objective or subjective, can be used to guide the discovery process.

■ We present a multidimensional view of data mining. The major dimensions are data, knowledge, technologies, and applications.

■ Data mining can be conducted on any kind of data as long as the data are meaningful for a target application, such as database data, data warehouse data, transactional data, and advanced data types. Advanced data types include time-related or sequence data, data streams, spatial and spatiotemporal data, text and multimedia data, graph and networked data, and Web data.

■ A data warehouse is a repository for long-term storage of data from multiple sources, organized so as to facilitate management decision making. The data are stored under a unified schema and are typically summarized. Data warehouse systems provide multidimensional data analysis capabilities, collectively referred to as online analytical processing.

■ Multidimensional data mining (also called exploratory multidimensional data mining) integrates core data mining techniques with OLAP-based multidimensional analysis. It searches for interesting patterns among multiple combinations of dimensions (attributes) at varying levels of abstraction, thereby exploring multidimensional data space.

■ Data mining functionalities are used to specify the kinds of patterns or knowledge to be found in data mining tasks. The functionalities include characterization and discrimination; the mining of frequent patterns, associations, and correlations; classification and regression; cluster analysis; and outlier detection. As new types of data, new applications, and new analysis demands continue to emerge, there is no doubt we will see more and more novel data mining tasks in the future.

1『 novel data mining 可以理解为新颖、新奇的数据挖掘。』

■ Data mining, as a highly application-driven domain, has incorporated technologies from many other domains. These include statistics, machine learning, database and data warehouse systems, and information retrieval. The interdisciplinary nature of data mining research and development contributes significantly to the success of data mining and its extensive applications.

■ Data mining has many successful applications, such as business intelligence, Web search, bioinformatics, health informatics, finance, digital libraries, and digital governments.

■ There are many challenging issues in data mining research. Areas include mining methodology, user interaction, efficiency and scalability, and dealing with diverse data types. Data mining research has strongly impacted society and will continue to do so in the future.

This book is an introduction to the young and fast-growing field of data mining (also known as knowledge discovery from data, or KDD for short). The book focuses on fundamental data mining concepts and techniques for discovering interesting patterns from data in various applications. In particular, we emphasize prominent techniques for developing effective, efficient, and scalable data mining tools.

This chapter is organized as follows. In Section 1.1, you will learn why data mining is in high demand and how it is part of the natural evolution of information technology. Section 1.2 defines data mining with respect to the knowledge discovery process. Next, you will learn about data mining from many aspects, such as the kinds of data that can be mined (Section 1.3), the kinds of knowledge to be mined (Section 1.4), the kinds of technologies to be used (Section 1.5), and targeted applications (Section 1.6). In this way, you will gain a multidimensional view of data mining. Finally, Section 1.7 outlines major data mining research and development issues.

### 1.1. Why Data Mining?

Necessity, who is the mother of invention. – Plato

We live in a world where vast amounts of data are collected daily. Analyzing such data is an important need. Section 1.1.1 looks at how data mining can meet this need by providing tools to discover knowledge from data. In Section 1.1.2, we observe how data mining can be viewed as a result of the natural evolution of information technology.

Moving toward the Information Age. This explosive growth of available data volume is a result of the computerization of our society and the fast development of powerful data collection and storage tools. Businesses worldwide generate gigantic data sets, including sales transactions, stock trading records, product descriptions, sales promotions, company profiles and performance, and customer feedback. For example, large stores, such as Wal-Mart, handle hundreds of millions of transactions per week at thousands of branches around the world. Scientific and engineering practices generate high orders of petabytes of data in a continuous manner, from remote sensing, process measuring, scientific experiments, system performance, engineering observations, and environment surveillance.

This explosively growing, widely available, and gigantic body of data makes our time truly the data age. Powerful and versatile tools are badly needed to automatically uncover valuable information from the tremendous amounts of data and to transform such data into organized knowledge. This necessity has led to the birth of data mining. The field is young, dynamic, and promising. Data mining has and will continue to make great strides in our journey from the data age toward the coming information age.

Data mining turns a large collection of data into knowledge. A search engine (e.g., Google) receives hundreds of millions of queries every day. Each query can be viewed as a transaction where the user describes her or his information need. What novel and useful knowledge can a search engine learn from such a huge collection of queries collected from users over time? Interestingly, some patterns found in user search queries can disclose invaluable knowledge that cannot be obtained by reading individual data items alone. For example, Google's Flu Trends uses specific search terms as indicators of flu activity. It found a close relationship between the number of people who search for flu-related information and the number of people who actually have flu symptoms. A pattern emerges when all of the search queries related to flu are aggregated. Using aggregated Google search data, Flu Trends can estimate flu activity up to two weeks faster than traditional systems can. 2 This example shows how data mining can turn a large collection of data into knowledge that can help meet a current global challenge.

Data Mining as the Evolution of Information Technology. Data mining can be viewed as a result of the natural evolution of information technology. The database and data management industry evolved in the development of several critical functionalities (Figure 1.1): data collection and database creation, data management (including data storage and retrieval and database transaction processing), and advanced data analysis (involving data warehousing and data mining). The early development of data collection and database creation mechanisms served as a prerequisite for the later development of effective mechanisms for data storage and retrieval, as well as query and transaction processing. Nowadays numerous database systems offer query and transaction processing as common practice. Advanced data analysis has naturally become the next step.

Since the 1960s, database and information technology has evolved systematically from primitive file processing systems to sophisticated and powerful database systems. The research and development in database systems since the 1970s progressed from early hierarchical and network database systems to relational database systems (where data are stored in relational table structures; see Section 1.3.1), data modeling tools, and indexing and accessing methods. In addition, users gained convenient and flexible data access through query languages, user interfaces, query optimization, and transaction management. Efficient methods for online transaction processing (OLTP), where a query is viewed as a read-only transaction, contributed substantially to the evolution and wide acceptance of relational technology as a major tool for efficient storage, retrieval, and management of large amounts of data.

After the establishment of database management systems, database technology moved toward the development of advanced database systems, data warehousing, and data mining for advanced data analysis and web-based databases. Advanced database systems, for example, resulted from an upsurge of research from the mid-1980s onward. These systems incorporate new and powerful data models such as extended-relational, object-oriented, object-relational, and deductive models. Application-oriented database systems have flourished, including spatial, temporal, multimedia, active, stream and sensor, scientific and engineering databases, knowledge bases, and office information bases. Issues related to the distribution, diversification, and sharing of data have been studied extensively.

1『建立数据库管理系统时后面做数据挖掘的关键前提。』

Advanced data analysis sprang up from the late 1980s onward. The steady and dazzling progress of computer hardware technology in the past three decades led to large supplies of powerful and affordable computers, data collection equipment, and storage media. This technology provides a great boost to the database and information industry, and it enables a huge number of databases and information repositories to be available for transaction management, information retrieval, and data analysis. Data can now be stored in many different kinds of databases and information repositories.

One emerging data repository architecture is the data warehouse (Section 1.3.2). This is a repository of multiple heterogeneous data sources organized under a unified schema at a single site to facilitate management decision making. Data warehouse technology includes data cleaning, data integration, and online analytical processing (OLAP) — that is, analysis techniques with functionalities such as summarization, consolidation, and aggregation, as well as the ability to view information from different angles. Although OLAP tools support multidimensional analysis and decision making, additional data analysis tools are required for in-depth analysis — for example, data mining tools that provide data classification, clustering, outlier/anomaly detection, and the characterization of changes in data over time.

Huge volumes of data have been accumulated beyond databases and data warehouses. During the 1990s, the World Wide Web and web-based databases (e.g., XML databases) began to appear. Internet-based global information bases, such as the WWW and various kinds of interconnected, heterogeneous databases, have emerged and play a vital role in the information industry. The effective and efficient analysis of data from such different forms of data by integration of information retrieval, data mining, and information network analysis technologies is a challenging task.

In summary, the abundance of data, coupled with the need for powerful data analysis tools, has been described as a data rich but information poor situation (Figure 1.2). The fast-growing, tremendous amount of data, collected and stored in large and numerous data repositories, has far exceeded our human ability for comprehension without powerful tools. As a result, data collected in large data repositories become "data tombs" — data archives that are seldom visited. Consequently, important decisions are often made based not on the information-rich data stored in data repositories but rather on a decision maker's intuition, simply because the decision maker does not have the tools to extract the valuable knowledge embedded in the vast amounts of data. Efforts have been made to develop expert system and knowledge-based technologies, which typically rely on users or domain experts to manually input knowledge into knowledge bases. Unfortunately, however, the manual knowledge input procedure is prone to biases and errors and is extremely costly and time consuming. The widening gap between data and information calls for the systematic development of data mining tools that can turn data tombs into「golden nuggets」of knowledge.

### 1.2. What Is Data Mining?

It is no surprise that data mining, as a truly interdisciplinary subject, can be defined in many different ways. To refer to the mining of gold from rocks or sand, we say gold mining instead of rock or sand mining. Analogously, data mining should have been more appropriately named「knowledge mining from data,」which is unfortunately somewhat long. However, the shorter term, knowledge mining may not reflect the emphasis on mining from large amounts of data. Nevertheless, mining is a vivid term characterizing the process that finds a small set of precious nuggets from a great deal of raw material (Figure 1.3). Thus, such a misnomer carrying both「data」and「mining」became a popular choice. In addition, many other terms have a similar meaning to data mining — for example, knowledge mining from data, knowledge extraction, data/pattern analysis, data archaeology, and data dredging.

Many people treat data mining as a synonym for another popularly used term, knowledge discovery from data, or KDD, while others view data mining as merely an essential step in the process of knowledge discovery. The knowledge discovery process is shown in Figure 1.4 as an iterative sequence of the following steps:

1 Data cleaning (to remove noise and inconsistent data).

2 Data integration (where multiple data sources may be combined). 3

3 Data selection (where data relevant to the analysis task are retrieved from the database).

4 Data transformation (where data are transformed and consolidated into forms appropriate for mining by performing summary or aggregation operations). 4

5 Data mining (an essential process where intelligent methods are applied to extract data patterns).

6 Pattern evaluation (to identify the truly interesting patterns representing knowledge based on interestingness measures — see Section 1.4.6).

7 Knowledge presentation (where visualization and knowledge representation techniques are used to present mined knowledge to users).

### 1.3. What Kinds of Data Can Be Mined?

As a general technology, data mining can be applied to any kind of data as long as the data are meaningful for a target application. The most basic forms of data for mining applications are database data (Section 1.3.1), data warehouse data (Section 1.3.2), and transactional data (Section 1.3.3). The concepts and techniques presented in this book focus on such data. Data mining can also be applied to other forms of data (e.g., data streams, ordered/sequence data, graph or networked data, spatial data, text data, multimedia data, and the WWW). We present an overview of such data in Section 1.3.4. Techniques for mining of these kinds of data are briefly introduced in Chapter 13. In-depth treatment is considered an advanced topic. Data mining will certainly continue to embrace new data types as they emerge.

Database Data. A database system, also called a database management system (DBMS), consists of a collection of interrelated data, known as a database, and a set of software programs to manage and access the data. The software programs provide mechanisms for defining database structures and data storage; for specifying and managing concurrent, shared, or distributed data access; and for ensuring consistency and security of the information stored despite system crashes or attempts at unauthorized access.

A relational database is a collection of tables, each of which is assigned a unique name. Each table consists of a set of attributes (columns or fields) and usually stores a large set of tuples (records or rows). Each tuple in a relational table represents an object identified by a unique key and described by a set of attribute values. A semantic data model, such as an entity-relationship (ER) data model, is often constructed for relational databases. An ER data model represents the database as a set of entities and their relationships.

A relational database for AllElectronics. The fictitious AllElectronics store is used to illustrate concepts throughout this book. The company is described by the following relation tables: customer, item, employee, and branch. The headers of the tables described here are shown in Figure 1.5. (A header is also called the schema of a relation.)

■ The relation customer consists of a set of attributes describing the customer information, including a unique customer identity number (cust_ID), customer name, address, age, occupation, annual income, credit information, and category.

■ Similarly, each of the relations item, employee, and branch consists of a set of attributes describing the properties of these entities.

■ Tables can also be used to represent the relationships between or among multiple entities. In our example, these include purchases (customer purchases items, creating a sales transaction handled by an employee), items_sold (lists items sold in a given transaction), and works_at (employee works at a branch of AllElectronics).

1『在这里把关系数据库的几个核心概念弄清楚了。1）一张表单即为一个实体（object）集，每一行记录（row）代表着一个实体各个维度的属性信息，有一个 ID（该表的主键），比如 cust_ID，库里的其他表单都是这种基本的结构；2）需要挖掘分析的数据库，针对不同的应用场景，可以由多个实体集表单组合而成，比如采购数据库包含客户表单、商品表单、雇员表单、交易表单，purchases (customer purchases items, creating a sales transaction handled by an employee)。』

Relational data can be accessed by database queries written in a relational query language (e.g., SQL) or with the assistance of graphical user interfaces. A given query is transformed into a set of relational operations, such as join, selection, and projection, and is then optimized for efficient processing. A query allows retrieval of specified subsets of the data. Suppose that your job is to analyze the AllElectronics data. Through the use of relational queries, you can ask things like,「Show me a list of all items that were sold in the last quarter.」Relational languages also use aggregate functions such as sum, avg (average), count, max (maximum), and min (minimum). Using aggregates allows you to ask:「Show me the total sales of the last month, grouped by branch,」or「How many sales transactions occurred in the month of December?」or「Which salesperson had the highest sales?」

When mining relational databases, we can go further by searching for trends or data patterns. For example, data mining systems can analyze customer data to predict the credit risk of new customers based on their income, age, and previous credit information. Data mining systems may also detect deviations — that is, items with sales that are far from those expected in comparison with the previous year. Such deviations can then be further investigated. For example, data mining may discover that there has been a change in packaging of an item or a significant increase in price. Relational databases are one of the most commonly available and richest information repositories, and thus they are a major data form in the study of data mining.

Data Warehouses. Suppose that AllElectronics is a successful international company with branches around the world. Each branch has its own set of databases. The president of AllElectronics has asked you to provide an analysis of the company's sales per item type per branch for the third quarter. This is a difficult task, particularly since the relevant data are spread out over several databases physically located at numerous sites. If AllElectronics had a data warehouse, this task would be easy. A data warehouse is a repository of information collected from multiple sources, stored under a unified schema, and usually residing at a single site. Data warehouses are constructed via a process of data cleaning, data integration, data transformation, data loading, and periodic data refreshing. This process is discussed in Chapter 3 and Chapter 4. Figure 1.6 shows the typical framework for construction and use of a data warehouse for AllElectronics.

1『原来一直说的 branche 指的是分公司。』

To facilitate decision making, the data in a data warehouse are organized around major subjects (e.g., customer, item, supplier, and activity). The data are stored to provide information from a historical perspective, such as in the past 6 to 12 months, and are typically summarized. For example, rather than storing the details of each sales transaction, the data warehouse may store a summary of the transactions per item type for each store or, summarized to a higher level, for each sales region.

A data warehouse is usually modeled by a multidimensional data structure, called a data cube, in which each dimension corresponds to an attribute or a set of attributes in the schema, and each cell stores the value of some aggregate measure such as count or sum(sales_amount). A data cube provides a multidimensional view of data and allows the precomputation and fast access of summarized data.

1『又见矩阵，即多维度向量的应用，很亲切。』

A data cube for AllElectronics. A data cube for summarized sales data of AllElectronics is presented in Figure 1.7(a). The cube has three dimensions: address (with city values Chicago, New York, Toronto, Vancouver), time (with quarter values Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4), and item (with item type values: home entertainment, computer, phone, security). The aggregate value stored in each cell of the cube is sales_amount (in thousands). For example, the total sales for the first quarter, Q1, for the items related to security systems in Vancouver is \$400,000, as stored in cell 〈Vancouver, Q1, security〉. Additional cubes may be used to store aggregate sums over each dimension, corresponding to the aggregate values obtained using different SQL group-bys (e.g., the total sales amount per city and quarter, or per city and item, or per quarter and item, or per each individual dimension).

Figure 1.7 A multidimensional data cube, commonly used for data warehousing, (a) showing summarized data for AllElectronics and (b) showing summarized data resulting fromdrill-down and roll-up operations on the cube in (a). For improved readability, only some of the cube cell values are shown.

1『上面的 data cube 图，脑子里要能想象出来。第一张是整体数据，三个维度；第二、三张是第一张在各个维度上的扩展，一个是在时间维度上做了细分，从季度分解到月份，一个是在地区维度上做了聚合，从区域聚合到了国家。』

By providing multidimensional data views and the precomputation of summarized data, data warehouse systems can provide inherent support for OLAP. Online analytical processing operations make use of background knowledge regarding the domain of the data being studied to allow the presentation of data at different levels of abstraction. Such operations accommodate different user viewpoints. Examples of OLAP operations include drill-down and roll-up, which allow the user to view the data at differing degrees of summarization, as illustrated in Figure 1.7(b). For instance, we can drill down on sales data summarized by quarter to see data summarized by month. Similarly, we can roll up on sales data summarized by city to view data summarized by country.

Although data warehouse tools help support data analysis, additional tools for data mining are often needed for in-depth analysis. Multidimensional data mining (also called exploratory multidimensional data mining) performs data mining in multidimensional space in an OLAP style. That is, it allows the exploration of multiple combinations of dimensions at varying levels of granularity in data mining, and thus has greater potential for discovering interesting patterns representing knowledge. An overview of data warehouse and OLAP technology is provided in Chapter 4. Advanced issues regarding data cube computation and multidimensional data mining are discussed in Chapter 5.

Transactional Data. In general, each record in a transactional database captures a transaction, such as a customer's purchase, a flight booking, or a user's clicks on a web page. A transaction typically includes a unique transaction identity number (trans_ID) and a list of the items making up the transaction, such as the items purchased in the transaction. A transactional database may have additional tables, which contain other information related to the transactions, such as item description, information about the salesperson or the branch, and so on.

事物数据的概念。事务数据库的每个记录代表一个事务，如顾客的一次购物、一个航班订票或一个用户的网页点击。通常，一个事务包含一个唯一的事务标识号（trans_ID），以及个组成事务的项（如，交易中购买的商品）的列表。事务数据库可能有一些与之相关联的附加表，包含关于事务的其他信息，如商品描述、关于销售人员或部门等的信息。

A transactional database for AllElectronics. Transactions can be stored in a table, with one record per transaction. A fragment of a transactional database for AllElectronics is shown in Figure 1.8. From the relational database point of view, the sales table in the figure is a nested relation because the attribute list_of_item_IDs contains a set of items. Because most relational database systems do not support nested relational structures, the transactional database is usually either stored in a flat file in a format similar to the table in Figure 1.8 or unfolded into a standard relation in a format similar to the items_sold table in Figure 1.5.

由于大部分关系数据库系统都不支持嵌套关系结构，事务数据库通常存放在一个类似于图 1.8 中的表格式的平面文件中，或展开到类似于图 1.5 的 iems_sold 表的标准关系中。

As an analyst of AllElectronics, you may ask,「Which items sold well together?」This kind of market basket data analysis would enable you to bundle groups of items together as a strategy for boosting sales. For example, given the knowledge that printers are commonly purchased together with computers, you could offer certain printers at a steep discount (or even for free) to customers buying selected computers, in the hopes of selling more computers (which are often more expensive than printers). A traditional database system is not able to perform market basket data analysis. Fortunately, data mining on transactional data can do so by mining frequent itemsets, that is, sets of items that are frequently sold together. The mining of such frequent patterns from transactional data is discussed in Chapter 6 and Chapter 7.

1『又见「购物篮」数据分析。』

Other Kinds of Data. Besides relational database data, data warehouse data, and transaction data, there are many other kinds of data that have versatile forms and structures and rather different semantic meanings. Such kinds of data can be seen in many applications: time-related or sequence data (e.g., historical records, stock exchange data, and time-series and biological sequence data), data streams (e.g., video surveillance and sensor data, which are continuously transmitted), spatial data (e.g., maps), engineering design data (e.g., the design of buildings, system components, or integrated circuits), hypertext and multimedia data (including text, image, video, and audio data), graph and networked data (e.g., social and information networks), and the Web (a huge, widely distributed information repository made available by the Internet). These applications bring about new challenges, like how to handle data carrying special structures (e.g., sequences, trees, graphs, and networks) and specific semantics (such as ordering, image, audio and video contents, and connectivity), and how to mine patterns that carry rich structures and semantics.

除关系数据库数据、数据仓库数据和事务数据外，还有许多其他类型的数据，它们具有各种各样的形式和结构，具有很不相同的语义。这样的数据类型在许多应用中都可以看到，如时间相关或序列数据（例如历史记录、股票交易数据、时间序列和生物学序列数据）、数据流（例如视频监控和传感器数据，它们连续播送）、空间数据（如地图）、工程设计数据（如建筑数据、系统部件或集成电路）、超文本和多媒体数据（包括文本、图像、视频和音频数据）、图和网状数据（如社会和信息网络）和万维网（由 Internet 提供的巨型、广泛分布的信息存储库）。这些应用带来了新的挑战，例如，如何处理具有空间结构的数据（如序列、树、图和网络）和特殊语义（如次序、图像、音频和视频的内容、连接性），以及如何挖掘具有丰富结构和语义的模式。

Various kinds of knowledge can be mined from these kinds of data. Here, we list just a few. Regarding temporal data, for instance, we can mine banking data for changing trends, which may aid in the scheduling of bank tellers according to the volume of customer traffic. Stock exchange data can be mined to uncover trends that could help you plan investment strategies (e.g., the best time to purchase AllElectronics stock). We could mine computer network data streams to detect intrusions based on the anomaly of message flows, which may be discovered by clustering, dynamic construction of stream models or by comparing the current frequent patterns with those at a previous time. With spatial data, we may look for patterns that describe changes in metropolitan poverty rates based on city distances from major highways. The relationships among a set of spatial objects can be examined in order to discover which subsets of objects are spatially autocorrelated or associated. By mining text data, such as literature on data mining from the past ten years, we can identify the evolution of hot topics in the field. By mining user comments on products (which are often submitted as short text messages), we can assess customer sentiments and understand how well a product is embraced by a market. From multimedia data, we can mine images to identify objects and classify them by assigning semantic labels or tags. By mining video data of a hockey game, we can detect video sequences corresponding to goals. Web mining can help us learn about the distribution of information on the WWW in general, characterize and classify web pages, and uncover web dynamics and the association and other relationships among different web pages, users, communities, and web-based activities.

It is important to keep in mind that, in many applications, multiple types of data are present. For example, in web mining, there often exist text data and multimedia data (e.g., pictures and videos) on web pages, graph data like web graphs, and map data on some web sites. In bioinformatics, genomic sequences, biological networks, and 3-D spatial structures of genomes may coexist for certain biological objects. Mining multiple data sources of complex data often leads to fruitful findings due to the mutual enhancement and consolidation of such multiple sources. On the other hand, it is also challenging because of the difficulties in data cleaning and data integration, as well as the complex interactions among the multiple sources of such data.

While such data require sophisticated facilities for efficient storage, retrieval, and updating, they also provide fertile ground and raise challenging research and implementation issues for data mining. Data mining on such data is an advanced topic. The methods involved are extensions of the basic techniques presented in this book.

### 1.4. What Kinds of Patterns Can Be Mined?

We have observed various types of data and information repositories on which data mining can be performed. Let us now examine the kinds of patterns that can be mined.

There are a number of data mining functionalities. These include characterization and discrimination (Section 1.4.1); the mining of frequent patterns, associations, and correlations (Section 1.4.2); classification and regression (Section 1.4.3); clustering analysis (Section 1.4.4); and outlier analysis (Section 1.4.5). Data mining functionalities are used to specify the kinds of patterns to be found in data mining tasks. In general, such tasks can be classified into two categories: descriptive and predictive. Descriptive mining tasks characterize properties of the data in a target data set. Predictive mining tasks perform induction on the current data in order to make predictions. Data mining functionalities, and the kinds of patterns they can discover, are described below. In addition, Section 1.4.6 looks at what makes a pattern interesting. Interesting patterns represent knowledge.

1『几个经典数据挖掘算法：特征化与区分、关联与相关性分析、分类与回归、聚类、离群点分析。这几个算法又可以抽象成 2 类：描述性算法和预测性算法。』

Class/Concept Description: Characterization and Discrimination. Data entries can be associated with classes or concepts. For example, in the AllElectronics store, classes of items for sale include computers and printers, and concepts of customers include bigSpenders and budgetSpenders. It can be useful to describe individual classes and concepts in summarized, concise, and yet precise terms. Such descriptions of a class or a concept are called class/concept descriptions. These descriptions can be derived using (1) data characterization, by summarizing the data of the class under study (often called the target class) in general terms, or (2) data discrimination, by comparison of the target class with one or a set of comparative classes (often called the contrasting classes), or (3) both data characterization and discrimination.

Data characterization is a summarization of the general characteristics or features of a target class of data. The data corresponding to the user-specified class are typically collected by a query. For example, to study the characteristics of software products with sales that increased by 10% in the previous year, the data related to such products can be collected by executing an SQL query on the sales database. 

There are several methods for effective data summarization and characterization. Simple data summaries based on statistical measures and plots are described in Chapter 2. The data cube-based OLAP roll-up operation (Section 1.3.2) can be used to perform user-controlled data summarization along a specified dimension. This process is further detailed in Chapter 4 and Chapter 5, which discuss data warehousing. An attribute-oriented induction technique can be used to perform data generalization and characterization without step-by-step user interaction. This technique is also described in Chapter 4.

The output of data characterization can be presented in various forms. Examples include pie charts, bar charts, curves, multidimensional data cubes, and multidimensional tables, including crosstabs. The resulting descriptions can also be presented as generalized relations or in rule form (called characteristic rules).

Data characterization. A customer relationship manager at AllElectronics may order the following data mining task: Summarize the characteristics of customers who spend more than \$5000 a year at AllElectronics. The result is a general profile of these customers, such as that they are 40 to 50 years old, employed, and have excellent credit ratings. The data mining system should allow the customer relationship manager to drill down on any dimension, such as on occupation to view these customers according to their type of employment.

Data discrimination is a comparison of the general features of the target class data objects against the general features of objects from one or multiple contrasting classes. The target and contrasting classes can be specified by a user, and the corresponding data objects can be retrieved through database queries. For example, a user may want to compare the general features of software products with sales that increased by 10% last year against those with sales that decreased by at least 30% during the same period. The methods used for data discrimination are similar to those used for data characterization.

「How are discrimination descriptions output?」The forms of output presentation are similar to those for characteristic descriptions, although discrimination descriptions should include comparative measures that help to distinguish between the target and contrasting classes. Discrimination descriptions expressed in the form of rules are referred to as discriminant rules.

Data discrimination. A customer relationship manager at AllElectronics may want to compare two groups of customers — those who shop for computer products regularly (e.g., more than twice a month) and those who rarely shop for such products (e.g., less than three times a year). The resulting description provides a general comparative profile of these customers, such as that 80% of the customers who frequently purchase computer products are between 20 and 40 years old and have a university education, whereas 60% of the customers who infrequently buy such products are either seniors or youths, and have no university degree. Drilling down on a dimension like occupation, or adding a new dimension like income_level, may help to find even more discriminative features between the two classes.

Concept description, including characterization and discrimination, is described in Chapter 4.

Mining Frequent Patterns, Associations, and Correlations. Frequent patterns, as the name suggests, are patterns that occur frequently in data. There are many kinds of frequent patterns, including frequent itemsets, frequent subsequences (also known as sequential patterns), and frequent substructures. A frequent itemset typically refers to a set of items that often appear together in a transactional data set — for example, milk and bread, which are frequently bought together in grocery stores by many customers. A frequently occurring subsequence, such as the pattern that customers, tend to purchase first a laptop, followed by a digital camera, and then a memory card, is a (frequent) sequential pattern. A substructure can refer to different structural forms (e.g., graphs, trees, or lattices) that may be combined with itemsets or subsequences. If a substructure occurs frequently, it is called a (frequent) structured pattern. Mining frequent patterns leads to the discovery of interesting associations and correlations within data.

Association analysis. Suppose that, as a marketing manager at AllElectronics, you want to know which items are frequently purchased together (i.e., within the same transaction). An example of such a rule, mined from the AllElectronics transactional database, is

```
buys(X,“computer”) ⇒ buys(X,“software”) [support = 1%,conﬁdence = 50%]
```

where X is a variable representing a customer. A confidence, or certainty, of 50% means that if a customer buys a computer, there is a 50% chance that she will buy software as well. A 1% support means that 1% of all the transactions under analysis show that computer and software are purchased together. This association rule involves a single attribute or predicate (i.e., buys) that repeats. Association rules that contain a single predicate are referred to as single-dimensional association rules. Dropping the predicate notation, the rule can be written simply as「computer ⇒ software [1%, 50%].」

Suppose, instead, that we are given the AllElectronics relational database related to purchases. A data mining system may find association rules like:

```
age(X, “20..29”) ∧ income(X, “40K..49K”) ⇒ buys(X, “laptop”)[support = 2%, conﬁdence = 60%]

The rule indicates that of the AllElectronics customers under study, 2% are 20 to 29 years old with an income of \$40,000 to $49,000 and have purchased a laptop (computer) at AllElectronics. There is a 60% probability that a customer in this age and income group will purchase a laptop. Note that this is an association involving more than one attribute or predicate (i.e., age, income, and buys). Adopting the terminology used in multidimensional databases, where each attribute is referred to as a dimension, the above rule can be referred to as a multidimensional association rule.

Typically, association rules are discarded as uninteresting if they do not satisfy both a minimum support threshold and a minimum confidence threshold. Additional analysis can be performed to uncover interesting statistical correlations between associated attribute – value pairs.

Frequent itemset mining is a fundamental form of frequent pattern mining. The mining of frequent patterns, associations, and correlations is discussed in Chapter 6 and Chapter 7, where particular emphasis is placed on efficient algorithms for frequent itemset mining. Sequential pattern mining and structured pattern mining are considered advanced topics.

Classification and Regression for Predictive Analysis. Classification is the process of finding a model (or function) that describes and distinguishes data classes or concepts. The model are derived based on the analysis of a set of training data (i.e., data objects for which the class labels are known). The model is used to predict the class label of objects for which the the class label is unknown.

「How is the derived model presented?」The derived model may be represented in various forms, such as classification rules (i.e., IF-THEN rules), decision trees, mathematical formulae, or neural networks (Figure 1.9). A decision tree is a flowchart-like tree structure, where each node denotes a test on an attribute value, each branch represents an outcome of the test, and tree leaves represent classes or class distributions. Decision trees can easily be converted to classification rules. A neural network, when used for classification, is typically a collection of neuron-like processing units with weighted connections between the units. There are many other methods for constructing classification models, such as naïve Bayesian classification, support vector machines, and k-nearest-neighbor classification.

1『一些典型的分类模型：IF-THEN rules、决策树、神经网络、贝叶斯、support vector machines（SVM）以及 k-nearest-neighbor。』

Figure 1.9 A classification model can be represented in various forms: (a) IF-THEN rules, (b) a decision tree, or (c) a neural network.

Whereas classification predicts categorical (discrete, unordered) labels, regression models continuous-valued functions. That is, regression is used to predict missing or unavailable numerical data values rather than (discrete) class labels. The term prediction refers to both numeric prediction and class label prediction. Regression analysis is a statistical methodology that is most often used for numeric prediction, although other methods exist as well. Regression also encompasses the identification of distribution trends based on the available data.

分类预测类别（离散的、无序的）标号，而回归建立连续值函数模型。也就是说，回归用来预测缺失的或难以获得的数值数据值，而不是（离散的）类标号。术语预测可以指数值预测和类标号预测。尽管还存在其他方法，但是回归分析是一种最常使用的数值预测的统计学方法。回归也包含基于可用数据的分布趋势识別。

Classification and regression may need to be preceded by relevance analysis, which attempts to identify attributes that are significantly relevant to the classification and regression process. Such attributes will be selected for the classification and regression process. Other attributes, which are irrelevant, can then be excluded from consideration.

Classification and regression. Suppose as a sales manager of AllElectronics you want to classify a large set of items in the store, based on three kinds of responses to a sales campaign: good response, mild response and no response. You want to derive a model for each of these three classes based on the descriptive features of the items, such as price, brand, place_made, type, and category. The resulting classification should maximally distinguish each class from the others, presenting an organized picture of the data set.

Suppose that the resulting classification is expressed as a decision tree. The decision tree, for instance, may identify price as being the single factor that best distinguishes the three classes. The tree may reveal that, in addition to price, other features that help to further distinguish objects of each class from one another include brand and place_made. Such a decision tree may help you understand the impact of the given sales campaign and design a more effective campaign in the future.

Suppose instead, that rather than predicting categorical response labels for each store item, you would like to predict the amount of revenue that each item will generate during an upcoming sale at AllElectronics, based on the previous sales data. This is an example of regression analysis because the regression model constructed will predict a continuous function (or ordered value.)

Chapter 8 and Chapter 9 discuss classification in further detail. Regression analysis is beyond the scope of this book. Sources for further information are given in the bibliographic notes.

分类与回归。假设作为 Alelectronics 的销售经理，你想根据对促销活动的三种反应，对商店的商品集合分类：好的反应，中等反应和没有反应。你想根据商品的描述特性，如 price、brand、place_made 和 category，对这三类的每一种导出模型。结果分类将最大限度地区别每一类，提供有组织的数据集描述。1）假设结果分类模型用决策树的形式表示。例如，决策树可能把 price 看做最能区分三个类的因素。该树可能揭示，除了 price 之外，帮助进一步区分每类对象的其他特征包括 brand 和 place_made。这样的决策树可以帮助你理解给定促销活动的影响，并帮助你设计未来更有效的促销活动。2）假设你不是预测顾客对每种商品反应的分类标号，而是想根据先前的销售数据，预测在 Alelectronics 的未来销售中每种商品的收益。这是一个回归分析的例子，因为所构造的模型将预测一个连续函数（或有序值）。

Cluster Analysis. Unlike classification and regression, which analyze class-labeled (training) data sets, clustering analyzes data objects without consulting class labels. In many cases, class-labeled data may simply not exist at the beginning. Clustering can be used to generate class labels for a group of data. The objects are clustered or grouped based on the principle of maximizing the intraclass similarity and minimizing the interclass similarity. That is, clusters of objects are formed so that objects within a cluster have high similarity in comparison to one another, but are rather dissimilar to objects in other clusters. Each cluster so formed can be viewed as a class of objects, from which rules can be derived. Clustering can also facilitate taxonomy formation, that is, the organization of observations into a hierarchy of classes that group similar events together.

Cluster analysis. Cluster analysis can be performed on AllElectronics customer data to identify homogeneous subpopulations of customers. These clusters may represent individual target groups for marketing. Figure 1.10 shows a 2-D plot of customers with respect to customer locations in a city. Three clusters of data points are evident. Cluster analysis forms the topic of Chapter 10 and Chapter 11.

Outlier Analysis. A data set may contain objects that do not comply with the general behavior or model of the data. These data objects are outliers. Many data mining methods discard outliers as noise or exceptions. However, in some applications (e.g., fraud detection) the rare events can be more interesting than the more regularly occurring ones. The analysis of outlier data is referred to as outlier analysis or anomaly mining.

Outliers may be detected using statistical tests that assume a distribution or probability model for the data, or using distance measures where objects that are remote from any other cluster are considered outliers. Rather than using statistical or distance measures, density-based methods may identify outliers in a local region, although they look normal from a global statistical distribution view.

Outlier analysis. Outlier analysis may uncover fraudulent usage of credit cards by detecting purchases of unusually large amounts for a given account number in comparison to regular charges incurred by the same account. Outlier values may also be detected with respect to the locations and types of purchase, or the purchase frequency. Outlier analysis is discussed in Chapter 12.

Are All Patterns Interesting? A data mining system has the potential to generate thousands or even millions of patterns, or rules. You may ask,「Are all of the patterns interesting?」Typically, the answer is no — only a small fraction of the patterns potentially generated would actually be of interest to a given user. This raises some serious questions for data mining. You may wonder,「What makes a pattern interesting? Can a data mining system generate all of the interesting patterns? Or, Can the system generate only the interesting ones?」

To answer the first question, a pattern is interesting if it is (1) easily understood by humans, (2) valid on new or test data with some degree of certainty, (3) potentially useful, and (4) novel. A pattern is also interesting if it validates a hypothesis that the user sought to confirm. An interesting pattern represents knowledge.

1『数据里的 pattern 即知识。』

Several objective measures of pattern interestingness exist. These are based on the structure of discovered patterns and the statistics underlying them. An objective measure for association rules of the form is rule support, representing the percentage of transactions from a transaction database that the given rule satisfies. This is taken to be the probability , where indicates that a transaction contains both X and Y, that is, the union of itemsets X and Y. Another objective measure for association rules is confidence, which assesses the degree of certainty of the detected association. This is taken to be the conditional probability ), that is, the probability that a transaction containing X also contains Y. More formally, support and confidence are defined as:

```
support(X ⇒ Y) = P(X ∪ Y)
conﬁdence(X ⇒ Y) = P(Y | X)
```

1『 conﬁdence 置信度，support 支持度，threshold 阈值。』

In general, each interestingness measure is associated with a threshold, which may be controlled by the user. For example, rules that do not satisfy a confidence threshold of, say, 50% can be considered uninteresting. Rules below the threshold likely reflect noise, exceptions, or minority cases and are probably of less value.

Other objective interestingness measures include accuracy and coverage for classification (IF-THEN) rules. In general terms, accuracy tells us the percentage of data that are correctly classified by a rule. Coverage is similar to support, in that it tells us the percentage of data to which a rule applies. Regarding understandability, we may use simple objective measures that assess the complexity or length in bits of the patterns mined.

Although objective measures help identify interesting patterns, they are often insufficient unless combined with subjective measures that reflect a particular user's needs and interests. For example, patterns describing the characteristics of customers who shop frequently at AllElectronics should be interesting to the marketing manager, but may be of little interest to other analysts studying the same database for patterns on employee performance. Furthermore, many patterns that are interesting by objective standards may represent common sense and, therefore, are actually uninteresting.

Subjective interestingness measures are based on user beliefs in the data. These measures find patterns interesting if the patterns are unexpected (contradicting a user's belief) or offer strategic information on which the user can act. In the latter case, such patterns are referred to as actionable. For example, patterns like「a large earthquake often follows a cluster of small quakes」may be highly actionable if users can act on the information to save lives. Patterns that are expected can be interesting if they confirm a hypothesis that the user wishes to validate or they resemble a user's hunch.

The second question —「Can a data mining system generate all of the interesting patterns?」— refers to the completeness of a data mining algorithm. It is often unrealistic and inefficient for data mining systems to generate all possible patterns. Instead, user-provided constraints and interestingness measures should be used to focus the search. For some mining tasks, such as association, this is often sufficient to ensure the completeness of the algorithm. Association rule mining is an example where the use of constraints and interestingness measures can ensure the completeness of mining. The methods involved are examined in detail in Chapter 6.

Finally, the third question —「Can a data mining system generate only interesting patterns?」— is an optimization problem in data mining. It is highly desirable for data mining systems to generate only interesting patterns. This would be efficient for users and data mining systems because neither would have to search through the patterns generated to identify the truly interesting ones. Progress has been made in this direction; however, such optimization remains a challenging issue in data mining.

Measures of pattern interestingness are essential for the efficient discovery of patterns by target users. Such measures can be used after the data mining step to rank the discovered patterns according to their interestingness, filtering out the uninteresting ones. More important, such measures can be used to guide and constrain the discovery process, improving the search efficiency by pruning away subsets of the pattern space that do not satisfy prespecified interestingness constraints. Examples of such a constraint-based mining process are described in Chapter 7 (with respect to pattern discovery) and Chapter 11 (with respect to clustering).

Methods to assess pattern interestingness, and their use to improve data mining efficiency, are discussed throughout the book with respect to each kind of pattern that can be mined.

### 1.5. Which Technologies Are Used?

As a highly application-driven domain, data mining has incorporated many techniques from other domains such as statistics, machine learning, pattern recognition, database and data warehouse systems, information retrieval, visualization, algorithms, high-performance computing, and many application domains (Figure 1.11). The interdisciplinary nature of data mining research and development contributes significantly to the success of data mining and its extensive applications. In this section, we give examples of several disciplines that strongly influence the development of data mining methods.

Statistics. Statistics studies the collection, analysis, interpretation or explanation, and presentation of data. Data mining has an inherent connection with statistics. A statistical model is a set of mathematical functions that describe the behavior of the objects in a target class in terms of random variables and their associated probability distributions. Statistical models are widely used to model data and data classes. For example, in data mining tasks like data characterization and classification, statistical models of target classes can be built. In other words, such statistical models can be the outcome of a data mining task. Alternatively, data mining tasks can be built on top of statistical models. For example, we can use statistics to model noise and missing data values. Then, when mining patterns in a large data set, the data mining process can use the model to help identify and handle noisy or missing values in the data.

统计模型是一组数学函数，它们用随机变量及其概率分布刻画目标类对象的行为。统计模型广泛用于对数据和数据类建模。例如，在像数据特征化和分类这样的数据挖掘任务中可以建立目标类的统计模型。换言之，这种统计模型可以是数据挖掘任务的结果。反过来，数据挖掘任务也可以建立在统计模型之上。例如，我们可以使用统计模型对噪声和缺失的数据值建模。于是，在大数据集中挖掘模式时，数据挖掘过程可以使用该模型来帮助识别数据中的噪声和缺失值。

Statistics research develops tools for prediction and forecasting using data and statistical models. Statistical methods can be used to summarize or describe a collection of data. Basic statistical descriptions of data are introduced in Chapter 2. Statistics is useful for mining various patterns from data as well as for understanding the underlying mechanisms generating and affecting the patterns. Inferential statistics (or predictive statistics) models data in a way that accounts for randomness and uncertainty in the observations and is used to draw inferences about the process or population under investigation.

推理统计学（或预测统计学）用某种方式对数据建模，解释测中的随机性和确定性，并用来提取关于所考察的过程或总体的结论。

Statistical methods can also be used to verify data mining results. For example, after a classification or prediction model is mined, the model should be verified by statistical hypothesis testing. A statistical hypothesis test (sometimes called confirmatory data analysis) makes statistical decisions using experimental data. A result is called statistically significant if it is unlikely to have occurred by chance. If the classification or prediction model holds true, then the descriptive statistics of the model increases the soundness of the model.

统计假设检验（有时称做证实数据分析）使用实验数据进行统计判决。如果结果不大可能随机出现，则称它为统计显著的。如果分类或预测模型有效，则该模型的描述统计量将増强模型的可靠性。

Applying statistical methods in data mining is far from trivial. Often, a serious challenge is how to scale up a statistical method over a large data set. Many statistical methods have high complexity in computation. When such methods are applied on large data sets that are also distributed on multiple logical or physical sites, algorithms should be carefully designed and tuned to reduce the computational cost. This challenge becomes even tougher for online applications, such as online query suggestions in search engines, where data mining is required to continuously handle fast, real-time data streams.

一个巨大的挑战是如何把统计学方法用于大型数据集。许多统计学方法都具有很高的计算复杂度。当这些方法应用于分布在多个逻辑或物理站点上的大型数据集时，应该小心地设计和调整算法，以降低计算开销。对于联机应用而言，如 Web 搜索引擎中的联机查询建议，数据挖掘必须连续处理快速、实时的数据流，这种挑战变得更加难以应对。

1『监控视频这种数据流的特点是实时、必须连续处理快速。』

Machine Learning. Machine learning investigates how computers can learn (or improve their performance) based on data. A main research area is for computer programs to automatically learn to recognize complex patterns and make intelligent decisions based on data. For example, a typical machine learning problem is to program a computer so that it can automatically recognize handwritten postal codes on mail after learning from a set of examples. Machine learning is a fast-growing discipline. Here, we illustrate classic problems in machine learning that are highly related to data mining.

■ Supervised learning is basically a synonym for classification. The supervision in the learning comes from the labeled examples in the training data set. For example, in the postal code recognition problem, a set of handwritten postal code images and their corresponding machine-readable translations are used as the training examples, which supervise the learning of the classification model.

■ Unsupervised learning is essentially a synonym for clustering. The learning process is unsupervised since the input examples are not class labeled. Typically, we may use clustering to discover classes within the data. For example, an unsupervised learning method can take, as input, a set of images of handwritten digits. Suppose that it finds 10 clusters of data. These clusters may correspond to the 10 distinct digits of 0 to 9, respectively. However, since the training data are not labeled, the learned model cannot tell us the semantic meaning of the clusters found.

■ Semi-supervised learning is a class of machine learning techniques that make use of both labeled and unlabeled examples when learning a model. In one approach, labeled examples are used to learn class models and unlabeled examples are used to refine the boundaries between classes. For a two-class problem, we can think of the set of examples belonging to one class as the positive examples and those belonging to the other class as the negative examples. In Figure 1.12, if we do not consider the unlabeled examples, the dashed line is the decision boundary that best partitions the positive examples from the negative examples. Using the unlabeled examples, we can refine the decision boundary to the solid line. Moreover, we can detect that the two positive examples at the top right corner, though labeled, are likely noise or outliers.

在学习模型时，它使用标记的和未标记的实例。在一种方法中，标记的实例用来学习类模型，而未标记的实例用来进一步改进类边界。对于两类问题，我们可以把属于一个类的实例看做正实例，而属于另一个类的实例为负实例。在图 1.12 中，如果我们不考虑未标记的实例，则虚线是分隔正实例和负实例的最佳决策边界。使用未标记的实例，我们可以把该决策边界改进为实线边界。此外，我们能够检测出右上角的两个正实例可能是噪声或离群点，尽管它们被标记了。

■ Active learning is a machine learning approach that lets users play an active role in the learning process. An active learning approach can ask a user (e.g., a domain expert) to label an example, which may be from a set of unlabeled examples or synthesized by the learning program. The goal is to optimize the model quality by actively acquiring knowledge from human users, given a constraint on how many examples they can be asked to label.

它让用户在学习过程中扮演主动角色。主动学习方法可能要求用户（例如领域专家）对一个可能来自未标记的实例集或由学习程序合成的实例进行标记。给定可以要求标记的实例数量的约束，目的是通过主动地从用户获取知识来提高模型质量。

1『监督学习对应于分类；非监督学习对应于聚类；半监督式学习，标记的实例用来学习类模型，而未标记的实例用来进一步改进类边界；主动式学习，通过主动地从用户获取知识来提高模型质量。』

You can see there are many similarities between data mining and machine learning. For classification and clustering tasks, machine learning research often focuses on the accuracy of the model. In addition to accuracy, data mining research places strong emphasis on the efficiency and scalability of mining methods on large data sets, as well as on ways to handle complex types of data and explore new, alternative methods.

Database Systems and Data Warehouses. Database systems research focuses on the creation, maintenance, and use of databases for organizations and end-users. Particularly, database systems researchers have established highly recognized principles in data models, query languages, query processing and optimization methods, data storage, and indexing and accessing methods. Database systems are often well known for their high scalability in processing very large, relatively structured data sets.

Many data mining tasks need to handle large data sets or even real-time, fast streaming data. Therefore, data mining can make good use of scalable database technologies to achieve high efficiency and scalability on large data sets. Moreover, data mining tasks can be used to extend the capability of existing database systems to satisfy advanced users' sophisticated data analysis requirements.

Recent database systems have built systematic data analysis capabilities on database data using data warehousing and data mining facilities. A data warehouse integrates data originating from multiple sources and various timeframes. It consolidates data in multidimensional space to form partially materialized data cubes. The data cube model not only facilitates OLAP in multidimensional databases but also promotes multidimensional data mining (see Section 1.3.2).

Information Retrieval. Information retrieval (IR) is the science of searching for documents or information in documents. Documents can be text or multimedia, and may reside on the Web. The differences between traditional information retrieval and database systems are twofold: Information retrieval assumes that (1) the data under search are unstructured; and (2) the queries are formed mainly by keywords, which do not have complex structures (unlike SQL queries in database systems).

The typical approaches in information retrieval adopt probabilistic models. For example, a text document can be regarded as a bag of words, that is, a multiset of words appearing in the document. The document's language model is the probability density function that generates the bag of words in the document. The similarity between two documents can be measured by the similarity between their corresponding language models.

Furthermore, a topic in a set of text documents can be modeled as a probability distribution over the vocabulary, which is called a topic model. A text document, which may involve one or multiple topics, can be regarded as a mixture of multiple topic models. By integrating information retrieval models and data mining techniques, we can find the major topics in a collection of documents and, for each document in the collection, the major topics involved.

Increasingly large amounts of text and multimedia data have been accumulated and made available online due to the fast growth of the Web and applications such as digital libraries, digital governments, and health care information systems. Their effective search and analysis have raised many challenging issues in data mining. Therefore, text mining and multimedia data mining, integrated with information retrieval methods, have become increasingly important.

### 1.6. Which Kinds of Applications Are Targeted?

Where there are data, there are data mining applications. As a highly application-driven discipline, data mining has seen great successes in many applications. It is impossible to enumerate all applications where data mining plays a critical role. Presentations of data mining in knowledge-intensive application domains, such as bioinformatics and software engineering, require more in-depth treatment and are beyond the scope of this book. To demonstrate the importance of applications as a major dimension in data mining research and development, we briefly discuss two highly successful and popular application examples of data mining: business intelligence and search engines.

1『数据挖掘的 2 个典型应用：商业智能和搜索引擎。』

Business Intelligence. It is critical for businesses to acquire a better understanding of the commercial context of their organization, such as their customers, the market, supply and resources, and competitors. Business intelligence (BI) technologies provide historical, current, and predictive views of business operations. Examples include reporting, online analytical processing, business performance management, competitive intelligence, benchmarking, and predictive analytics.

「How important is business intelligence?」Without data mining, many businesses may not be able to perform effective market analysis, compare customer feedback on similar products, discover the strengths and weaknesses of their competitors, retain highly valuable customers, and make smart business decisions. Clearly, data mining is the core of business intelligence. Online analytical processing tools in business intelligence rely on data warehousing and multidimensional data mining. Classification and prediction techniques are the core of predictive analytics in business intelligence, for which there are many applications in analyzing markets, supplies, and sales. Moreover, clustering plays a central role in customer relationship management, which groups customers based on their similarities. Using characterization mining techniques, we can better understand features of each customer group and develop customized customer reward programs.

Web Search Engines. A Web search engine is a specialized computer server that searches for information on the Web. The search results of a user query are often returned as a list (sometimes called hits). The hits may consist of web pages, images, and other types of files. Some search engines also search and return data available in public databases or open directories. Search engines differ from web directories in that web directories are maintained by human editors whereas search engines operate algorithmically or by a mixture of algorithmic and human input.

Web search engines are essentially very large data mining applications. Various data mining techniques are used in all aspects of search engines, ranging from crawling 5 (e.g., deciding which pages should be crawled and the crawling frequencies), indexing (e.g., selecting pages to be indexed and deciding to which extent the index should be constructed), and searching (e.g., deciding how pages should be ranked, which advertisements should be added, and how the search results can be personalized or made「context aware」).

Search engines pose grand challenges to data mining. First, they have to handle a huge and ever-growing amount of data. Typically, such data cannot be processed using one or a few machines. Instead, search engines often need to use computer clouds, which consist of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of computers that collaboratively mine the huge amount of data. Scaling up data mining methods over computer clouds and large distributed data sets is an area for further research.

Second, Web search engines often have to deal with online data. A search engine may be able to afford constructing a model offline on huge data sets. To do this, it may construct a query classifier that assigns a search query to predefined categories based on the query topic (i.e., whether the search query「apple」is meant to retrieve information about a fruit or a brand of computers). Whether a model is constructed offline, the application of the model online must be fast enough to answer user queries in real time.

Another challenge is maintaining and incrementally updating a model on fast-growing data streams. For example, a query classifier may need to be incrementally maintained continuously since new queries keep emerging and predefined categories and the data distribution may change. Most of the existing model training methods are offline and static and thus cannot be used in such a scenario.

Third, Web search engines often have to deal with queries that are asked only a very small number of times. Suppose a search engine wants to provide context-aware query recommendations. That is, when a user poses a query, the search engine tries to infer the context of the query using the user's profile and his query history in order to return more customized answers within a small fraction of a second. However, although the total number of queries asked can be huge, most of the queries may be asked only once or a few times. Such severely skewed data are challenging for many data mining and machine learning methods.

### 1.7. Major Issues in Data Mining

Data mining is a dynamic and fast-expanding field with great strengths. In this section, we briefly outline the major issues in data mining research, partitioning them into five groups: mining methodology, user interaction, efficiency and scalability, diversity of data types, and data mining and society. Many of these issues have been addressed in recent data mining research and development to a certain extent and are now considered data mining requirements; others are still at the research stage. The issues continue to stimulate further investigation and improvement in data mining.

Mining Methodology. Researchers have been vigorously developing new data mining methodologies. This involves the investigation of new kinds of knowledge, mining in multidimensional space, integrating methods from other disciplines, and the consideration of semantic ties among data objects. In addition, mining methodologies should consider issues such as data uncertainty, noise, and incompleteness. Some mining methods explore how user-specified measures can be used to assess the interestingness of discovered patterns as well as guide the discovery process. Let's have a look at these various aspects of mining methodology.

■ Mining various and new kinds of knowledge: Data mining covers a wide spectrum of data analysis and knowledge discovery tasks, from data characterization and discrimination to association and correlation analysis, classification, regression, clustering, outlier analysis, sequence analysis, and trend and evolution analysis. These tasks may use the same database in different ways and require the development of numerous data mining techniques. Due to the diversity of applications, new mining tasks continue to emerge, making data mining a dynamic and fast-growing field. For example, for effective knowledge discovery in information networks, integrated clustering and ranking may lead to the discovery of high-quality clusters and object ranks in large networks.

■ Mining knowledge in multidimensional space: When searching for knowledge in large data sets, we can explore the data in multidimensional space. That is, we can search for interesting patterns among combinations of dimensions (attributes) at varying levels of abstraction. Such mining is known as (exploratory) multidimensional data mining. In many cases, data can be aggregated or viewed as a multidimensional data cube. Mining knowledge in cube space can substantially enhance the power and flexibility of data mining.

■ Data mining—an interdisciplinary effort: The power of data mining can be substantially enhanced by integrating new methods from multiple disciplines. For example, to mine data with natural language text, it makes sense to fuse data mining methods with methods of information retrieval and natural language processing. As another example, consider the mining of software bugs in large programs. This form of mining, known as bug mining, benefits from the incorporation of software engineering knowledge into the data mining process.

■ Boosting the power of discovery in a networked environment: Most data objects reside in a linked or interconnected environment, whether it be the Web, database relations, files, or documents. Semantic links across multiple data objects can be used to advantage in data mining. Knowledge derived in one set of objects can be used to boost the discovery of knowledge in a「related」or semantically linked set of objects.

■ Handling uncertainty, noise, or incompleteness of data: Data often contain noise, errors, exceptions, or uncertainty, or are incomplete. Errors and noise may confuse the data mining process, leading to the derivation of erroneous patterns. Data cleaning, data preprocessing, outlier detection and removal, and uncertainty reasoning are examples of techniques that need to be integrated with the data mining process.

■ Pattern evaluation and pattern- or constraint-guided mining: Not all the patterns generated by data mining processes are interesting. What makes a pattern interesting may vary from user to user. Therefore, techniques are needed to assess the interestingness of discovered patterns based on subjective measures. These estimate the value of patterns with respect to a given user class, based on user beliefs or expectations. Moreover, by using interestingness measures or user-specified constraints to guide the discovery process, we may generate more interesting patterns and reduce the search space.

User Interaction. The user plays an important role in the data mining process. Interesting areas of research include how to interact with a data mining system, how to incorporate a user's background knowledge in mining, and how to visualize and comprehend data mining results. We introduce each of these here.

■ Interactive mining: The data mining process should be highly interactive. Thus, it is important to build flexible user interfaces and an exploratory mining environment, facilitating the user's interaction with the system. A user may like to first sample a set of data, explore general characteristics of the data, and estimate potential mining results. Interactive mining should allow users to dynamically change the focus of a search, to refine mining requests based on returned results, and to drill, dice, and pivot through the data and knowledge space interactively, dynamically exploring「cube space」while mining.

■ Incorporation of background knowledge: Background knowledge, constraints, rules, and other information regarding the domain under study should be incorporated into the knowledge discovery process. Such knowledge can be used for pattern evaluation as well as to guide the search toward interesting patterns.

■ Ad hoc data mining and data mining query languages: Query languages (e.g., SQL) have played an important role in flexible searching because they allow users to pose ad hoc queries. Similarly, high-level data mining query languages or other high-level flexible user interfaces will give users the freedom to define ad hoc data mining tasks. This should facilitate specification of the relevant sets of data for analysis, the domain knowledge, the kinds of knowledge to be mined, and the conditions and constraints to be enforced on the discovered patterns. Optimization of the processing of such flexible mining requests is another promising area of study.

■ Presentation and visualization of data mining results: How can a data mining system present data mining results, vividly and flexibly, so that the discovered knowledge can be easily understood and directly usable by humans? This is especially crucial if the data mining process is interactive. It requires the system to adopt expressive knowledge representations, user-friendly interfaces, and visualization techniques.

Efficiency and Scalability. Efficiency and scalability are always considered when comparing data mining algorithms. As data amounts continue to multiply, these two factors are especially critical.

■ Efficiency and scalability of data mining algorithms: Data mining algorithms must be efficient and scalable in order to effectively extract information from huge amounts of data in many data repositories or in dynamic data streams. In other words, the running time of a data mining algorithm must be predictable, short, and acceptable by applications. Efficiency, scalability, performance, optimization, and the ability to execute in real time are key criteria that drive the development of many new data mining algorithms.

■ Parallel, distributed, and incremental mining algorithms: The humongous size of many data sets, the wide distribution of data, and the computational complexity of some data mining methods are factors that motivate the development ofparallel and distributed data-intensive mining algorithms. Such algorithms first partition the data into「pieces.」Each piece is processed, in parallel, by searching for patterns. The parallel processes may interact with one another. The patterns from each partition are eventually merged.

Cloud computing and cluster computing, which use computers in a distributed and collaborative way to tackle very large-scale computational tasks, are also active research themes in parallel data mining. In addition, the high cost of some data mining processes and the incremental nature of input promote incremental data mining, which incorporates new data updates without having to mine the entire data「from scratch.」Such methods perform knowledge modification incrementally to amend and strengthen what was previously discovered.

Diversity of Database Types. The wide diversity of database types brings about challenges to data mining. These include:

■ Handling complex types of data: Diverse applications generate a wide spectrum of new data types, from structured data such as relational and data warehouse data to semi-structured and unstructured data; from stable data repositories to dynamic data streams; from simple data objects to temporal data, biological sequences, sensor data, spatial data, hypertext data, multimedia data, software program code, Web data, and social network data. It is unrealistic to expect one data mining system to mine all kinds of data, given the diversity of data types and the different goals of data mining. Domain- or application-dedicated data mining systems are being constructed for in-depth mining of specific kinds of data. The construction of effective and efficient data mining tools for diverse applications remains a challenging and active area of research.

■ Mining dynamic, networked, and global data repositories: Multiple sources of data are connected by the Internet and various kinds of networks, forming gigantic, distributed, and heterogeneous global information systems and networks. The discovery of knowledge from different sources of structured, semi-structured, or unstructured yet interconnected data with diverse data semantics poses great challenges to data mining. Mining such gigantic, interconnected information networks may help disclose many more patterns and knowledge in heterogeneous data sets than can be discovered from a small set of isolated data repositories. Web mining, multisource data mining, and information network mining have become challenging and fast-evolving data mining fields.

Data Mining and Society. How does data mining impact society? What steps can data mining take to preserve the privacy of individuals? Do we use data mining in our daily lives without even knowing that we do? These questions raise the following issues:

■ Social impacts of data mining: With data mining penetrating our everyday lives, it is important to study the impact of data mining on society. How can we use data mining technology to benefit society? How can we guard against its misuse? The improper disclosure or use of data and the potential violation of individual privacy and data protection rights are areas of concern that need to be addressed.

■ Privacy-preserving data mining: Data mining will help scientific discovery, business management, economy recovery, and security protection (e.g., the real-time discovery of intruders and cyberattacks). However, it poses the risk of disclosing an individual's personal information. Studies on privacy-preserving data publishing and data mining are ongoing. The philosophy is to observe data sensitivity and preserve people's privacy while performing successful data mining.

■ Invisible data mining: We cannot expect everyone in society to learn and master data mining techniques. More and more systems should have data mining functions built within so that people can perform data mining or use data mining results simply by mouse clicking, without any knowledge of data mining algorithms. Intelligent search engines and Internet-based stores perform such invisible data mining by incorporating data mining into their components to improve their functionality and performance. This is done often unbeknownst to the user. For example, when purchasing items online, users may be unaware that the store is likely collecting data on the buying patterns of its customers, which may be used to recommend other items for purchase in the future.

These issues and many additional ones relating to the research, development, and application of data mining are discussed throughout the book.
