1001 Changing direction

It's September 2014 and I'm at the Art Workers' Guild in London, that remarkable organization I described in Chapter 1 . We're about to begin an all-day event I've called ‘Thread Management'. I've brought together a group of experts who all work with threads. Several of them, like me, are surgeons. One's a vascular consultant who operates on arteries and veins. Another is a cardiac surgeon who specializes in repairing diseased heart valves, rather than replacing them. A third's a paediatric surgeon, used to working on babies and children. Another is a scrub nurse, a key part of any surgical team.

Alongside the surgeons we've got experts from outside medicine. I've invited three puppeteers, who use threads to bring their marionettes to life. There's a fisherman, who uses lines for casting and tying flies for catching trout. There's one of the UK's leading experts in experimental knitting and textile design. And there are a couple of engineers from Imperial, who are analysing threads mathematically to create computer models.

We're all here because of Fleur Oakes, the three-dimensional embroiderer whose ideas of ‘wrongness' came up in Chapter 9 . Fleur had come to a surgical simulation I led that had demonstrated how surgeons join segments of intestine using sutures. For me, the focus had been on showing how the team created an anastomosis in gut or blood vessels, something I'd done countless times as a trauma surgeon. But when Fleur saw that simulation, she wasn't interested in anatomy, or the nuances of injury or disease. What she saw was how the surgical team used sutures and needles. She called it ‘thread management'.

Fleur's never been to medical school. Instead, she studied fine art, fashion design and embroidery. She's an expert maker, and an expert teacher too. When I asked her what she meant by ‘thread management', she said, ‘I noticed you'd got all these threads floating around during that operation. That's what happens with my students too. The first thing I have to teach them is how not to get their threads tangled up. I tell them that a thread should never be longer than the distance from your fingers to your elbow; that you have to pay constant attention to each thread's tension; that you have to make sure the thread doesn't twist up in a spiral like an old-fashioned telephone cable if you're sewing along a curve.'

I wish someone had said that to me when I was training in surgery. As an assistant, I lost count of the number of times I allowed a thread to get snarled up in a retractor while I was ‘following' my boss as she completed a difficult anastomosis. As a surgeon myself, I often got frustrated by the way fine suture material twisted up in a spiral when I was sewing along a curve.

I'd learned my sewing from the surgeons I worked for. I never thought that an embroiderer might be able to help, because I never thought about professional embroiderers at all. At the time I hardly knew they existed. Years later, when Fleur made her comment about thread management, I realized she'd seen something in surgery that had been there all the time but I'd never noticed. She saw thread as a focal point. So we decided to explore this idea with other experts.

That day at the Art Workers' Guild took Fleur's work and mine in new directions. We'd asked all the participants to bring examples of their work and the materials they use. The surgeons and scrub nurse brought instruments, sutures and models of arteries. The fisherman had his rod and line; the puppeteers brought a bag full of marionettes; the textile artist had her spinning wheel; and the mathematicians brought a computer with their modelling software. Seeing these experts demonstrate their skills showed me that looking outside my own field could shine new light on what I thought I knew. Since then, cross-disciplinary exploration has become the focus of my research.

Thread Management transformed things for Fleur too, opening up a new phase in her career. At that event at the Art Workers' Guild, she found herself sitting next to Colin Bicknell, a consultant vascular surgeon. Fleur and Colin hit it off at once. Fleur had brought an embroidery frame and Colin had brought a simulated aorta made of silicon. When Colin demonstrated how he replaced a diseased aortic segment, inserting a Dacron graft with tiny stitches, Fleur immediately felt at home. Her own work with stitches seemed weirdly similar, even though the purpose was completely different.

Colin invited Fleur into his theatre to watch him operate on real patients, and she's never looked back. For over three years, she's been the embroiderer-in-residence in Colin's vascular surgery unit, a role that is probably unique. She's spent countless hours watching Colin and his team, figuring out how to use her skills to help trainee surgeons with theirs. She's watched the surgeons deal with everything you can imagine, from blocked leg arteries to ruptured aortic aneurysms that can kill in minutes. But she hasn't just confined their work to Colin's world. She's invited him and his students to her studio in north London, teaching them how to look, to draw and to sew like artists. She's designed a training programme for helping surgeons build their skills, starting with simple exercises in knotting and embroidery before progressing to complex procedures on fragile vintage fabrics which fall to pieces at a touch. It's uncannily like operating on sick patients whose arteries are as soft as butter or as brittle as clay pipes.

Fleur makes sense of what she sees in Colin's operating theatre because she's already an expert. Let's explore what's happening here in terms of the path in this book.

Fleur has been through all the stages I've described so far. She spent years at art school, studying to become a dressmaker as well as a fashion designer – doing time and learning to use her senses. She set up her own fashion house, designing and producing garments for other people. She got things wrong and had to put them right. In her fashion house she learned to recognize what her customers wanted, creating designs that matched their needs. Like the other experts in this book, she had to make the transition to ‘it's not about you' and she developed her voice.

The 2008 economic crash demolished Fleur's business, so for a while she morphed into a bespoke corset maker, creating a niche which brought together her talents as a designer and as a maker. She didn't abandon the skills she had learned, but turned them into something else. In terms of the previous chapter, she improvised . But although she was good at corset-making, she realized she wasn't cut out for it. She wanted a challenge that made full use of her dexterity and imagination. So, inspired by historic costumes in London's Victoria and Albert Museum, she became fascinated with three-dimensional embroidery. She spent hours recreating Jacobean stumpwork, working at a microscopic scale to create embroidered shapes based on the natural world. Now she's one of the leading experts in this unusual field.

By this time, Fleur was becoming well known, and highly respected as a craftsman and a teacher. She could have gone on doing that for the rest of her career. But in becoming the embroiderer-in-residence at Colin Bicknell's vascular surgery unit, Fleur has taken a new direction. Instead of carrying on as she was in the field she trained in, she's redefining it.

Not many experts do this. Most continue along the path they chose at the beginning. Having gone through the Apprentice phase in someone else's workshop, then honing and refining their expertise as Journeymen, they become Masters. They focus on passing on their knowledge to those who are following the path they themselves trod. This is vital work, not only for the learners who come up through the system, but for the survival of the system itself.

Experts like these continue their work in the way they have learned it. Clinicians look after patients in much the same way as their teachers, even though they take on new techniques. Magicians do magic shows, staying within a well-established way of working while developing new tricks or routines. Bespoke tailors continue making suits based on patterns and blocks that have been handed down through generations.

But some experts strike out in a different direction. These people challenge the nature of their field. Some, like Fleur, find inspiration in an unfamiliar setting that prompts them to think in new ways and from unexpected perspectives. Others, like John Wickham the keyhole surgery pioneer, revolutionize their whole field. These are the ones we'll explore in this chapter. I'll start with Mr Wickham.

2014 年 9 月，我在伦敦的艺术工作者行会，也就是我在第 1 章提到过的那个杰出的组织。我们即将开展一个全天的活动，我称之为「线条管理研讨会」。我邀请了一批与「线」一起工作的专家。有几个人和我一样，是外科医生。有一个血管外科顾问医师，从事动脉、静脉的手术工作。还有一个心外科医生，专攻修复病变心脏瓣膜，而不是替换瓣膜。有 1/3 的人是儿科医生，擅长婴儿、儿童工作。还有一名洗手护士，他们在任何外科团队中都是关键的组成部分。

除了外科医生，还有一些来自医学领域以外的专家。我邀请了三位木偶师，他们能用线给木偶带去生命。还有一名渔夫，他会给鱼线系上鱼饵，再抛投出去捕捉鳟鱼。我们还邀请了一位实验性编织与纺织品设计领域的顶尖专家。还有几名帝国理工学院的工程师，他们在用数学方法分析各种线程，以创建计算机模型。我们都是因为弗勒尔·奥克斯才聚集到这里来的。弗勒尔是一名三维刺绣师，第 9 章提到过她说的「错误意识」。弗勒尔参加过我开展的一次外科模拟活动，该活动演示了外科医生如何用缝合线缝合肠子。对我来说，这次活动的重点是展示外科团队如何对肠子或血管做吻合术，这是我在做创伤外科医生时做过无数次的工作。但当弗勒尔看到这种模拟展示时，她对解剖学、创伤或疾病中的细微之处并不感兴趣。她看到的是外科团队如何使用缝合线和穿刺针。她将这个过程称为「线条管理」。弗勒尔从没上过医学院。她学的是美术、时装设计与刺绣。她是一个专业的制造者，也是一个专业的教师。我问她「线条管理」是什么意思，她说：「我注意到，在手术中到处都是线。我的学生也会遇到这样的情况。我要教他们的第一件事，就是如何不让这些线缠在一起。我跟他们说，一根线的长度绝对不应该超过你手指到肘部的距离；你必须持续留意每条线上的张力；如果你在沿着曲线缝纫的话，就必须确保线不要像老式电话线那样拧成螺旋状。」

我真希望在我接受外科训练时有人能告诉我这些。在做手术助手时，我已经记不清有多少次，当上司做困难的吻合术时，我拿着牵开器「跟着」她，却让缝合线缠住了牵开器。在做外科医生时，当我沿着曲线缝合时，经常因为纤细的缝合材料拧成螺旋状而感到沮丧。

我跟着带我的外科医生学会了缝合。我从没想过刺绣师也能在这方面帮上忙，因为我从没有想过专业刺绣师。当时我几乎不知道他们的存在。多年以后，当弗勒尔谈论「线条管理」时，我意识到她在外科手术中看到了某些一直存在，但我却从未注意到的东西。她把线看作焦点。于是我们决定邀请其他专家一起探讨这个理念。

在艺术工作者行会举办活动的那天，弗勒尔和我的工作走上了新的方向。我们邀请所有参与者把他们工作中的例子和他们使用的材料带来。外科医生和洗手护士带来了手术器械、缝合线和动脉模型。渔夫带来了钓竿和鱼线，木偶师带来了满满一袋提线木偶，纺织品艺术家带来了她的纺车，数学家则带来了电脑和他们的建模软件。看到这些专家展示他们的技能，让我明白了，多看看自己领域以外的东西能让我对自己的知识产生新的理解。从那以后，跨学科的探索就成了我的研究重点。「线条管理研讨会」也改变了弗勒尔的工作，为她的职业生涯开辟了一个新阶段。在艺术工作者行会的那次活动中，她坐在血管外科顾问医师科林·比克内尔（ColinBicknell）旁边。

弗勒尔和科林一见如故。弗勒尔带来了一个绷子，而科林带来了一个硅胶制成的主动脉模型。科林演示了如何用细小的针线插入人工血管，替换主动脉的病变部分，弗勒尔立刻产生了一种无比熟悉的感觉。尽管目的完全不同，她自己用针线的手法却与科林出奇地相似。

科林邀请弗勒尔到手术室里看他为真正的患者做手术，她便对此着了迷。三年多来，她成了科林的血管外科的「住院刺绣师」，这个身份可能是独一无二的。她不知道花了多少时间观察科林和他的团队，思考如何用她的技能来帮助外科实习医生和实习刺绣师。她观摩了外科医生处理一切你能想到的事情 —— 从腿部动脉阻塞到能几分钟内置人于死地的动脉瘤破裂。

但是，他们的合作不仅局限于观摩科林的工作。她也邀请了科林和他的学生到她位于伦敦北部的工作室，教他们如何像艺术家一样观察、绘画和缝纫。她设计了一个培训项目，帮助外科医生提高技能，从最简单的打结与刺绣练习开始，然后再在脆弱的老式纺织品上进行复杂的操作 —— 这些纺织品一碰就会裂开。这就像给拥有像黄油一样柔软，或像陶土烟杆一样脆的动脉的患者做手术。

弗勒尔能够理解她在科林的手术室里看到的东西，因为她已经是专家了。我们从本书里讲的「成为专家之路」的角度来看看这件事。

弗勒尔已经经历了我目前讲过的所有阶段。她在艺术学校里待了许多年，学习如何做一名女装裁缝和时装设计师 —— 积累经验并学习运用感官。她开了自己的时装店，为别人设计和制作服装。她犯过错，也曾不得不纠错。在自己的时装店里，她学会了弄清顾客的需求，按照他们的需求设计服装。就像本书里的其他专家一样，她必须做出「重点不在于你」的转变，并找到自己的「声音」。

2008 年的经济危机极大地打击了弗勒尔的生意，所以她在一段时期内转型做了束身胸衣定制裁缝，开辟了一个小市场，同时发挥她设计与裁缝的能力。她没有放弃自己所学的技能，而是将其变成了别的东西。用上一章的话来说，她在随机应变。尽管她善于制作束身胸衣，但她意识到自己并不完全适合这项工作。她需要一个能充分发挥她灵巧手艺和丰富想象力的挑战。于是，在伦敦维多利亚与艾尔伯特博物馆里历史服装的启发下，她迷上了三维刺绣。她花了许多个小时重制詹姆士一世时期的立体刺绣，根据自然界创作微观刺绣图形。现在她成了这个不同寻常领域里的重要专家之一。

那时，弗勒尔已经很出名了，她在手工艺和教学领域备受尊敬。她本可以在接下来的职业生涯里继续做这些，但在科林·比克内尔的血管外科做「住院刺绣师」的经历，让弗勒尔有了新的方向。她没有按照她在刺绣领域所受的训练继续工作，而是重新定义了工作。

没有多少专家会这样做。大多数人会继续走他们当初选择的道路。在别人的「工坊」里经历学徒阶段，然后作为「熟练工」磨炼并完善自己的专业技能，他们最后成了大师。他们专注于把自己的知识传递给那些与他们走上同一条道路的人。这是一项重要的工作，不仅对于在该专业系统里不断进步的学习者来说很重要，对于这个系统本身的存活来说也是如此。

这样的专家会按照自己所学的方式继续工作。医生照顾患者的方式差不多和他们的老师一样，即使他们采用了更新的技术。

表演魔术的魔术师既延续了既定的工作方式，也开发了新的把戏或套路。定制裁缝会根据代代相传的样板与原型来制作西装。但有些专家却另辟蹊径。这些人挑战了他们领域的基本特点。有些人像弗勒尔一样，在陌生的环境中找到了灵感，让他们从意想不到的角度，以新的方式思考。还有些人像约翰·威克姆一样，彻底改变了他们的整个领域。我们在本章要讨论的就是后者。我会从威克姆先生开始讲起。

### 10.1 锁孔手术的先驱

Pioneers of keyhole surgery

If you have your gallbladder removed these days, it will almost certainly be done by keyhole surgery. You'll have a couple of tiny incisions in your abdomen, be out of hospital the same day and back to work soon after. But it wasn't always like that. When I was training as a surgeon in the 1980s, patients would be in hospital for weeks after elective surgery for gallstones. They'd have large painful wounds that took ages to heal. The procedure I was taught had been standard practice for decades. An educational film from the 1920s shows an operation almost identical to the one I learned as a surgical registrar. Then, almost overnight, everything changed.

The introduction of keyhole surgery in the late 1980s didn't tinker round the edges of what was already there. It was a revolution which turned surgery on its head, and a key figure in that revolution was Mr John Wickham. John died in October 2017 at the age of eighty-nine. He was one of the world's leading surgical pioneers, and a lifelong innovator.

After pioneering minimally invasive (‘keyhole') surgery in the 1980s, he continued to disrupt the medical world. He invented countless new technologies, including one of the first robot-assisted systems for removing the prostate. His ideas reverberate to this day, though until recently his contribution has been unjustly overlooked. I got to know John and his colleagues in the years before he died, and came to realize just how influential this gentle, soft-spoken man was.

John was a urologist. He specialized in treating patients with kidney stones. Like all the experts in this book, he went through the stages of Apprentice, Journeyman and Master. As a young trainee surgeon he gained a wide range of experience, including a spell in neurosurgery. For the first few years after he became a consultant, he performed operations which were standard at the time, making large incisions to expose the kidney and take out urinary tract stones.

He could have spent the rest of his career within this field. But John was restless, impatient with the status quo, and constantly searching for better ways to treat his patients. At first, his innovations took place within his specialty. He designed new instruments, including the Wickham retractor for open surgery which is still in use today. John was passionate about the quality of his work. In the operating theatre he tried to be as delicate with kidneys as neurosurgeons were with brains. He had a deep respect for human tissues and he carried out research into ways of operating on the kidney which minimized damage.

But John's vision went further than that. He told me that when he went to see his patients the day after their surgery, they would be in a lot of pain. An incision the length of a runner bean stretched around their side. John would hold up something the size of a lentil and say, ‘We've got your stone, Mr Smith.' The size of the incision seemed out of all proportion to the tiny stone. To John, this simply didn't make sense. He began to question the need for large incisions, challenging the orthodoxies of the time. Later, he wrote, ‘We still have far too many surgeons who believe that unless you cut a hole big enough to get your head in, you cannot see well enough to perform a proper operation.'

Bringing about change is never easy, and John's vision of a different kind of surgery made him unpopular with some of his colleagues. Surgery in the 1980s was very hierarchical. I know, because I was a trainee at the time and I was on the receiving end. Shit flowed downhill and I was at the bottom. But John Wickham didn't believe in hierarchies, and he wasn't interested in power or status. He wanted to create the best possible experience for the patients under his care, and he built a most unusual team. Decades later, I came to know many of them myself, when I began to research the early days of keyhole surgery.

John was in his eighties by then and many of his colleagues had also retired, but they all vividly remember that time. Toni Raybould (scrub nurse), Mike Kellett (interventional radiologist), Chris Russell (surgeon) and Stuart Greengrass (engineer and surgical instrument designer) talk about how John brought them together to find ways of minimizing the trauma inflicted by surgery. His ideas of teamwork broke new ground.

It was a heady time in surgery. Technology was moving at breakneck speed, and imaging techniques such as ultrasound and CT scanning were revolutionizing how doctors saw internal organs. Fibre-optics and miniaturization made it possible to pass tiny telescopes into body cavities. Lasers were opening up new possibilities for using energy to cure disease. The list seemed endless. With John's encouragement to take risks and be inventive, his research fellows came up with a host of new ideas. Some of these ideas turned out not to be feasible and petered out. Others, like flexible cystoscopy (using a narrow fibre-optic tube to look inside the bladder), have become standard practice.

One day, John Wickham and Mike Kellett made a breakthrough. First, Kellett manoeuvred a fine wire into their patient's kidney under X-ray control, then used dilators to create a tract big enough for a miniature telescope (a ‘laparoscope') to pass. Guiding his laparoscope along the tract, John made a small incision in the kidney, grasped the stone and pulled it out. As he did so, the team burst into a spontaneous round of applause – something seldom heard in operating theatres. The patient went home after a couple of days, instead of needing weeks in hospital to recover. The team had performed the UK's first percutaneous nephrolithotomy, removing a lentil-sized kidney stone through a lentil-sized incision. It was a pivotal moment.

From then on, things moved quickly. In the years that followed, Wickham and his team shaped a field which was evolving internationally. Kellett, already renowned for his ability to visualize anatomy in three dimensions, became increasingly skilled at placing wires and tubes in apparently inaccessible parts of the body. Greengrass came up with engineering solutions to the clinical problems Wickham was facing, such as how to get the best view through a laparoscope, how to zoom in and out, and how to design instruments along ergonomic principles. Raybould integrated these new technologies into the rhythms of the operating theatre.

But John wasn't content to revolutionize his specialist field of urology. After coining the term ‘minimally invasive surgery' (later popularized as ‘keyhole surgery'), he realized that this approach had huge implications for surgery as a whole, though it would be several more years before it became widespread. In a prescient editorial in the British Medical Journal in 1987, he wrote: ‘it seems extraordinary that general surgeons have not yet seized upon the potential of the laparoscope'. Only a couple of years later, the general surgeons did seize on that potential, changing the landscape of surgery forever. Since then, operation after operation has been transformed by keyhole surgery, and John's dream has become a reality.

现在，如果你要切除胆囊，几乎可以肯定你会接受锁孔手术。你的腹部会有几个小切口，当天就能出院，很快就能回到工作岗位，但事情并非一向如此。20 世纪 80 年代，在我还是外科医生的时候，患者因胆结石而接受选择性手术后，要住院好几个星期。他们的伤口很大、很痛苦，需要很长时间才能愈合。我学习的这个手术流程，在几十年来一直是标准操作。有一部 20 世纪 20 年代的教学影片展示过一个手术，几乎和我在做外科住院医生时学到的一模一样。然后，几乎在一夜之间，一切都改变了。

20 世纪 80 年代末，锁孔手术的出现并非对已有方法的小修小补。这是一场彻底改变外科手术的革命，这场革命的关键人物就是约翰·威克姆先生。约翰于 2017 年 10 月去世，享年 89 岁。他是世界上顶尖的外科先驱者之一，也是一个终生的革新者。

在 20 世纪 80 年代开创了微创（锁孔）手术之后，他不断地在医学界掀起波澜。他发明了无数新技术，包括最早的机器人辅助前列腺切除系统之一。他的思想至今仍有影响，不过他的贡献到最近才得到公正的承认。在约翰去世的几年前，我认识了他和他的同事，并逐渐意识到这个性情温和、轻声细语的人是多么有影响力。

约翰是泌尿科医生。他专门治疗肾结石患者。就像本书中的所有专家一样，他经历了学徒、熟练工和大师的阶段。在他还是年轻的外科实习医生时，他在许多领域里都积累了经验，在神经外科也待了一段时间。在成为顾问医师的最初几年里，他曾按照当时的标准做手术，即切开大切口，露出肾脏，取出尿路结石。

他本可以在这个领域按部就班地度过余下的职业生涯。但是约翰有闯劲，不安于现状，总在寻找更好的治疗方法。最初，他的创新就发生在自己的专业领域内。他设计了新的手术器械，包括用于开放手术的威克姆牵开器，至今仍在使用。约翰对于提高自己的工作质量充满热情。在手术室里，他努力像神经外科医生对待大脑那样小心地对待肾脏。他对人体组织怀有很深的敬意，对肾脏手术的方法进行了研究，以尽量减少对肾脏的损害。

但是约翰并不满足于此。他告诉我，他在术后第二天去看望患者时，患者仍然承受着巨大的痛苦。他们身体侧面有一条像荷包豆一样长的切口。约翰会拿着一个小扁豆大小的东西说：「史密斯先生，我们把你的结石取出来了。」

切口的大小与这块小小的结石似乎不成比例。在约翰看来，这根本不合理。他开始质疑做这种大切口的必要性，挑战当时的正统观念。他后来

写道：「仍有太多的外科医生认为，如果你不切一个大口子，大到足以把脑袋塞进去，你就看不清患处，不能好好做手术。」

引领变革从来都不是一件容易的事，约翰对于手术的另类想法，让他在一些同事中不受欢迎。20 世纪 80 年代的外科有着森严的等级制度。我知道这一点，是因为我当时在做实习医生，处在金字塔的底端。「屎往低处滚」，而我在最低处。但是约翰·威克姆不相信等级制度，他对权力和地位也不感兴趣。

他想为他治疗的患者带来最好的体验，于是组建了一个不同寻常的团队。几十年后，当我开始研究锁孔手术早期历史的时候，我自己也认识了这个团队中的许多人。

那时约翰已经 80 多岁了，他的许多同事也退休了，但他们都清晰地记得当时的情况。托尼·雷布尔德（Toni Raybould，洗手护士）、麦克·凯利特（ Mike Kellett，入放射科医生）、克里斯·拉塞尔（Chris Russell，外科医生）和斯图尔特·格林格拉斯（Stuart Greengrass，工程师、手术器械设计师）都讲述过约翰如何把他们聚集在一起，寻找减少手术造成的创伤的方法。他的团队合作理念开创了新的局面。

在外科领域，那是个令人振奋的时期。科技正以惊人的速度发展，超声波和 CT 扫描等成像技术正在改变医生观察内脏器官的方式。光纤和小型化技术让医生可以把微型窥镜放入人体腔室。激光开辟了利用能量来治疗疾病的可能性。这些例子无穷无尽。在约翰的鼓励下，他的科研同事冒着风险提出了许多新想法。有些想法后来被证明是不可行的，于是逐渐消失了。还有些想法，比如软性膀胱镜检查（用细光纤来观察膀胱内部），已经成了标准操作。

有一天，约翰·威克姆和麦克·凯利特取得了突破。首先，凯利特借助 X 光将一根细导线插入患者的肾脏，然后用扩张器撑开一个足够大的通道，让微型窥镜（「腹腔镜」）通过。约翰沿着这条通道操纵腹腔镜，在肾脏上切开了一个小口，夹住结石，把它取了出来。与此同时，手术团队里爆发出一阵掌声 —— 这是手术室里很少听到的声音。患者几天后就回家了，不需要在医院里待上几周才能康复。这个手术团队完成了英国首例经皮肾镜取石术，也就是通过一个小扁豆大小的切口，取出一块小扁豆大小的肾结石。这是一个重要的时刻。

从那以后，事情发展得很快。在接下来的几年里，威克姆和他的团队开创了一个在国际上不断发展的领域。凯利特之前就因为能够想象三维的解剖结构而闻名，他变得越来越擅长把导线和导管放置到难以触及的人体部位。格林格拉斯用工程学方法解决了威克姆面临的临床问题，比如如何用腹腔镜获得最理想的视角，如何放大和缩小画面，以及如何根据人体工程学原理设计手术器械。雷布尔德将这些新技术融入了手术室的工作流程里。

但是约翰并不满足于革新自己的泌尿科专业。在创造「微创手术」（后来常被称为「锁孔手术」）一词后，他意识到这种方法对整个外科领域都有巨大的影响，不过几年之后这种方法才被广泛采用。1987 年，他在《英国医学杂志》上一篇富有远见的社论中写道：「普通外科医生还没有意识到腹腔镜的潜力，这似乎是不可思议的。」仅仅几年后，普通外科医生确实意识到了这种潜力，永远地改变了外科手术。从那以后，锁孔手术技术改变了一台又一台的手术，约翰的梦想成了现实。

### 10.2 创新的大师

Masters of innovation

Not many people can claim to have revolutionized their field in the way that John Wickham and his colleagues revolutionized mine. But many of the experts in this book have taken a similar turn away from the orthodox world they trained in. David Owen, a magician with a parallel career as a barrister, had the idea of using the skills of performing magic to help young people with disabilities. With the support of a hospital charity led by Yvonne Farquharson, David and Richard McDougall (whom we met in Chapter 7 ) became founding members of Breathe Arts Magic. They created two-week summer camps for children and young people with hemiplegia, a one-sided weakness of the body usually caused by birth trauma affecting the brain. Many of these young people were unable to do up their buttons or use a zip, because of their inability to coordinate basic movements. Often, they felt socially isolated, struggling at school and seen as different by their peers.

David and Richard collaborated with occupational therapists to design magic tricks that these young people would want to practise, but which would also help their coordination and build their confidence. The programme was a runaway success. The young people became hooked on magic, practising for hours after every session. As well as making coins vanish and rubber bands hop mysteriously through the air, these young performers developed confidence and social skills through engaging with an audience, using eye contact to direct the attention of those watching. As I discovered when I visited one of the summer sessions, seeing these young people performing a magic trick, then opening a bag of crisps by themselves for the first time in their lives, was an unforgettable experience.

One of the magicians in David Owen's group is Will Houstoun. He, too, has redefined his field. Although Will has been fascinated by magic for as long as he can remember, he only became a professional magician after completing a master's degree in mechanical engineering. When we met Will in Chapter 7 , he was already highly successful. A winner of the European Magic Championships, he had become Magic Circle Close-up Magician of the Year 2015. He had perfected an eight-minute act, performing two shows a night, six nights a week. He had created an experience that audiences loved, making coins and playing cards wink in and out of existence. He told me he was doing what a magician was supposed to do, what other magicians wanted to see being done, and what those other magicians had decided magic ought to be. But despite having become a consummate performer, he wasn't satisfied by magic shows alone. He wanted to create his own form of magic.

At that time, Will was just completing his PhD in the history of Victorian magic. He wanted to challenge his audiences into thinking more widely, and was interested in the relationship between truth and deception. So he developed a new form of magic show, telling stories about magicians from the past. In it, he brings these magicians to life, performing their tricks himself; but as an added twist, Will playfully calls into question the truth of the historical stories themselves.

Will described his purpose like this: ‘This performance may not follow the traditional pattern of a magic show, but in making structural changes I've developed the kind of show I would want to see, one which says the things about magic which I'd like to say.' Will is not conforming to what other magicians do, but reframing what it means to be a magician.

Recently, Will and I have been exploring how the skills of magic can help students of science and medicine think of their work as performance. As magician-in-residence at the Centre for Performance Science, which I lead, Will is exploring how the skills of capturing and shaping attention can help clinicians and musicians in their own professions.

Back to Fleur in Colin's operating theatre. Fleur isn't just teaching surgeons how to sew; she's showing them how to look. By spending so much time with surgical teams, she's noticed things that the surgeons themselves are unaware of. Her artist's eye registers the colour, texture and consistency of the organs she sees. She notices how team members develop awareness of one another's bodies, coordinating their movements around each other and the patient on the table. She sees how some surgeons have an instinctive sympathy with anatomical planes, organs and structures, separating them without causing damage – and others haven't. She notices how surgeons are able to recognize instantly when something ‘isn't right'.

But Fleur doesn't spend all her time with surgeons. Much of her work is with colleagues in the world of textiles, with other lacemakers and embroiderers, and with her students. She wants to talk to them about her surgical projects but she doesn't want to freak them out with talk of blood and guts. In her latest work, she has communicated her insights into medicine through the language she's most fluent in: textiles.

One of Fleur's innovations is her Textile Body. Although it doesn't look anything like a human from the outside, inside its wooden box are layers which are uncannily surgical. Fleur invites people to explore these in the way an operating team would work, separating structures and holding them out of the way with gentleness and care. For the Textile Body, Fleur has chosen textiles that look or feel like human tissues. Vintage lace evokes the skin of an elderly patient. Undoing some buttons reveals knobbly yellow knitting: the abdominal fat. Then come more layers, filmy fabric membranes suggesting the planes of the abdominal cavity. Mysterious structures make you think of nerves and important blood vessels. The idea is not to identify these structures anatomically but to negotiate them without causing damage. The final task is to place a stitch with pinpoint accuracy into a fragile lace structure deep within the Textile Body. To reach it, you must work like a surgeon, separating layers with delicacy and precision. Just as in real surgery, you can't bring that structure to the surface where it's convenient to work on. You have to go to it.

Working on the Textile Body requires surgical skills and surgical sensitivities, but no surgical knowledge. By bringing surgery and textiles together, Fleur has merged two conceptual frameworks, two ways of looking at the world. She has combined the thinking of art and medicine to create something nobody has thought of before. She has broken through the boundaries of her field and taken it in a new direction.

Fleur wouldn't have been able to do that if she hadn't spent years becoming an expert herself. Yet just going through those stages wouldn't have been enough. In order to make her conceptual leap, Fleur needed the opportunity to move outside her field and the insight to imagine how these worlds could be connected.

没有多少人能像约翰·威克姆和他的同事那样，敢说他们彻底地改变了自己的领域。但是，本书中的许多专家都同样偏离了他们所接受的正统训练。大卫·欧文（David Owen）是一名魔术师，也是一名律师。他想到了利用魔术表演的技巧来帮助残疾的年轻人。在伊冯娜·法夸尔森（Yvonne Farquharson）的医院慈善机构的支持下，大卫与理查德·麦克杜格尔（我们在第 7 章提到过他）成了「呼吸艺术魔术协会」（Breathe Arts Magic）的创始人。他们为偏瘫的儿童和年轻人举办了为期两周的夏令营。偏瘫，即身体单侧无力，通常是由出生创伤影响大脑所引起的。这些年轻人中的许多人都不会系扣子、拉拉链，因为他们无法协调地完成基本动作。他们经常感到社交孤立，在学校里困难重重，是同龄人眼中的异类。

大卫和理查德与职业治疗师合作设计了这些年轻人想要学习的魔术，这些魔术还能帮助他们增强身体的协调能力，增强信心。这个项目取得了巨大的成功。这些年轻人迷上了魔术，每次都要练习好几个小时。除了让硬币消失、让橡皮筋在空中神奇地跳跃以外，这些年轻的表演者还通过与观众互动、用眼神交流吸引观众的注意力，培养了自信心和社交技能。在参观一节暑期课程时，我发现，看到这些年轻人表演魔术，然后有生以来第一次独立打开一袋薯片，是一次让我难忘的经历。

威尔·胡斯顿是大卫·欧文团队中的一名魔术师。他也改变了自己的领域。尽管威尔从记事起就对魔术着迷，但他在获得机械工程学硕士学位之后才成为专业魔术师。我们在第 7 章讲到过威尔，他那时已经非常成功了。他是欧洲魔术锦标赛的冠军，在 2015 年成为魔术圈的年度近景魔术师。他能完美地完成八分钟的表演，能一周六天、每天晚上演两场。他创造了观众喜闻乐见的体验，让硬币和扑克出现或消失。他对我说，他所做的是魔术师应该做的，是其他魔术师想看到的，也是其他魔术师认为魔术应该做到的。虽然他已经成为一名完美的表演者，但他并不满足于魔术表演。他想要创造属于自己的魔术。

当时，威尔刚刚获得维多利亚时代魔术史的博士学位。他想挑战自己的观众，让他们拓宽思路，对真相与欺骗之间的关系感兴趣。于是他发明了一种新的魔术表演形式，讲述过去的魔术师的故事。在表演中，他让这些魔术师活了过来，亲自表演他们的魔术；威尔还增添了一丝悬念，半开玩笑地质疑了历史故事本身的真实性。

威尔是这样描述他的目的的：「这种表演可能不会遵循传统魔术表演的模式，但通过结构上的改变，我创造出了我想看到的那种表演，这种表演体现了我对魔术的看法。」威尔不遵循其他魔术师的做法，而是重新定义了什么是魔术师。

近来，威尔和我一直在探讨如何用魔术的技巧来帮助理学、医学专业的学生把自己的工作当成表演。作为我的表现科学中心的常驻魔术师，威尔正在探索如何利用吸引和引导注意力的技巧来帮助医生和音乐家的工作。

再谈一谈科林的手术室里的弗勒尔。弗勒尔不仅要教外科医生如何缝纫，还要教他们如何观察。她花了很多时间和外科团队在一起，她注意到了一些外科医生自己都没意识到的事情。

她艺术家的眼睛能看到器官的颜色、质地和坚实程度。她能注意到团队成员如何形成对彼此身体的意识，如何根据彼此和手术台上的患者调整自己的动作。她能看到有些外科医生对解剖面、器官、组织结构有着本能的同情心，能将它们分开而不造成伤害 —— 另一些人则不是如此。她注意到外科医生能立即发现事情「不对劲」。

但是弗勒尔并没有把所有时间放在与外科医生一起工作上。她工作的很大一部分都是与纺织业的同事、其他花边纺织工和刺绣师，以及她的学生一起完成的。她想和他们讨论她在手术室的见闻，但她不想让血液和内脏吓到他们。她在最新的作品里表达了对医学的见解，她用的是自己最熟练的语言：纺织品。

弗勒尔最新的作品之一就是她的「纺织人体」（TextileBody）。虽然这件作品从外部看起来一点儿也不像人，但在它的木质盒子里，有着极其精确的解剖层次。弗勒尔邀请大家用手术团队的工作方式探索这些层次，将各组织结构分开，轻柔、小心地把它们拨到一边。弗勒尔为「纺织人体」选择了一些看起来或摸起来很像人体组织的纺织品。复古的网眼花边让人想起老年患者的皮肤。解开一些扣子，就会露出有疙瘩的黄色编织物：这就是腹部脂肪。里面还有更多的层次，薄膜代表了腹腔内的面。有些奇怪的结构会让你想到神经和重要的血管。弗勒尔的创作理念不是要让人从解剖学上识别这些结构，而是要在不造成损害的情况下摸索它们。体验者最后要做的一项任务，就是把针精确地扎进「纺织人体」深处的一个脆弱的网眼花边结构里。要找到这个结构，你必须像外科医生一样工作，仔细而准确地分开各层结构。就像在真正的外科手术中一样，你不能把那个结构拿到外面来 —— 当然在外面操作更为方便。你必须向内去找它。

在「纺织人体」上操作，需要外科的技能与敏感性，但不需要外科知识。通过将外科与纺织品结合在一起，弗勒尔将两种概念框架、两种看待世界的方式融合在了一起。她把艺术和医学的思维方式结合在了一起，创造出了以前没有人想到过的东西。她打破了自己领域的界限，将该领域带向了新的方向。

如果没有花费多年时间成为专家，弗勒尔是不可能做到这一点的。然而仅仅经历那些阶段是不够的。要实现概念上的飞跃，弗勒尔需要走出自己领域的机会，并且拥有足够的洞察力去想象这些不同的世界能够如何联系在一起。

### 10.3 池塘里的涟漪

Ripples on the pond

The Thread Management event in 2014 was like throwing a stone into a pond and watching the ripples. Though many of the participants were medical, the focus wasn't medicine – it was threads. Because the Art Workers' Guild is not a clinical setting, surgical suturing became just one instance of expert threadwork.

Many people in that room were much more skilled with threads than me. They had a wider awareness, experience and understanding of how threads behave. That's only natural, since handling threads is a small part of a surgeon's work but a major one for textile artists or puppeteers. And once the focal point was redefined, traditional hierarchies no longer held. We were not discussing whether operating on sick children was more or less ‘important' than fishing or puppetry. Like John Wickham and his team of innovators, everyone contributed something different, yet of equal value.

You have to become an expert before you can change direction like Fleur, John Wickham and Will. There are no shortcuts here. You have to go through those years of hard graft and cope with the ups and downs that make you the expert you've become. You have to earn your spurs. But once you've experienced this process from the inside, you have the skills you need to bring about change. Then it's a question of imagination, of stepping back from the how of being expert to the why ; to the meaning and purpose of your work. It makes you question what being an expert means, why it matters to you and how you can pass your knowledge on. That's what the next chapter is about.

2014 年的「线条管理研讨会」就像我们往池塘里扔了一块石头，然后看着水面泛起阵阵涟漪。虽然很多参与者都是医学工作者，但这次活动的重点不是医学 —— 而是线。因为艺术工作者行会不是一个医疗机构，外科缝合只是专家用线的一个例子。

那个房间里的许多人都比我擅长用线。他们对线的运作方式有着更多的认识、经验和理解。这是很自然的事情，处理缝合线只是外科医生工作中的一小部分，但却是纺织艺术家或木偶师的主要工作。一旦重新确定了活动的焦点，传统的贵贱之分就不复存在了。我们不是在讨论给生病的孩子做手术与钓鱼、木偶戏相比孰轻孰重。就像约翰·威克姆和他的创新团队一样，每个人都做了不同的贡献，但价值是相同的。

你必须首先成为一个专家，然后才能像弗勒尔、约翰·威克姆和威尔那样改变方向。这条道路没有捷径。你必须付出多年的艰苦努力，应对起伏成败。正是这些经历让你成为现在这样的专家。你必须证明自己的能力。但是，只要你的内心深处经历了这个过程，你就拥有了做出改变所需的技能。接下来就是想象力的问题了，从如何成为专家回到为什么成为专家的问题上，去寻找你工作的意义与目的。这会让你质疑作为专家的意义，为什么这件事对你很重要，以及你将如何把自己的知识传递下去。这就是下一章的主题。

## 1101. 传承技艺

1101 Passing it on

I'm teaching a group of GPs how to do simple surgical procedures, and I'm having a problem with Michael. It's the early 1990s, I've recently changed from surgery to general practice, and I'm running the first of a series of educational courses. Michael is an experienced GP, but he just doesn't seem to get what I'm showing him. I'm explaining how to hold instruments and tie knots. He seems clumsy, and I can't understand why he can't do what I ask. It's not as if I'm trying to teach him anything complicated – just obvious things that any doctor should know.

Soon after I joined my partnership I started teaching family doctors to carry out ‘minor surgery'. At that time, GPs were being encouraged by the government to do this kind of work. Most of it involved seemingly straightforward procedures, like excising lumps and bumps under local anaesthetic. But often the GPs had little or no surgical experience, so not surprisingly things didn't always go well. Sometimes they didn't send the lumps they removed for laboratory analysis, and skin cancers were missed. Sometimes they made large incisions and struggled to close them, resulting in unsightly scars. Sometimes they chose an inappropriate treatment altogether. Because of my surgical experience, I was invited to develop a training programme for the UK, funded by the government and supported by the Royal Colleges of Surgeons and General Practitioners. Working with the simulation company Limbs & Things, we developed latex models of those lumps and bumps, so the GPs could practise procedures without damaging real people. I also designed a three-day course and took it to centres around the UK.

Like Michael, many of the doctors on those courses really struggled. Though most of them knew far more than I did about general practice, they couldn't seem to do the simplest things with their hands. They used the wrong instrument to hold a suture needle. They struggled to tie a secure knot in a piece of thread. They couldn't use dissecting forceps without causing damage. At first I couldn't understand it. I knew that it wasn't because they were clumsy or stupid or uninterested – far from it.

Then I realized that it was because nobody had ever taught them these apparently straightforward skills. The surgeons they had watched as medical students or junior doctors were so expert they made everything look easy. It dawned on me that there was a kind of knowledge that experts assumed everyone had, but non-experts didn't know existed. Michael wasn't grappling with something simple at all. It only seemed simple to me because I knew how to do it. To him it wasn't like that. There was a huge gap between my understanding and his.

我正在教一群全科医生如何做简单的外科手术，我和迈克尔遇到了一些问题。当时是 20 世纪 90 年代初，我刚从外科转行到全科，并开办了最初的系列教学课程。迈克尔是一个经验丰富的全科医生，但他似乎不明白我给他展示的东西。我在给他讲解用手术器械打结的方法。他看上去有些笨拙，我不明白他为什么做不到我要他做的事情。我又不是在教他做什么复杂的事情 —— 不过是任何医生都应该会的小事。

在我与人合伙开全科诊所不久之后，我开始教家庭医生做「小手术」。当时，政府鼓励全科医生去做这种工作。这些手术大多数看起来都很简单，比如在局部麻醉下切除肿块和结节。但是全科医生通常少有或根本没有手术经验，所以事情并不总是顺利的。有时，他们没把切除的肿块送到实验室做分析，导致皮肤癌被漏诊。有时他们的切口很大，难以缝合，造成难堪的疤痕。有时他们会选择完全不合适的治疗方法。由于我有外太恐民小的大第 11 章传承技艺 219

科经验，所以我被人邀请为英国开发一个由政府资助的培训项目，这个项目也得到了英国皇家外科与全科医学院的支持。我们与医疗模拟产品公司 Limbs ＆ Things 合作，共同开发了这种肿块与结节的乳胶模型，这样全科医生就能在不伤害真人的情况下练习这种手术了。我还设计了一门为期三天的课程，在英国各地的教学中心授课。

像迈克尔一样，很多参加这些课程的医生都遇到了困难。尽管他们中的大多数人都比我了解全科医学，但他们似乎连最简单的动手操作都不会。他们会用错误的器械来持缝合针。他们很难用线打一个牢固的结。他们不会在不造成损伤的情况下使用解剖钳。起初我不能理解这种情况。我知道这并不是因为他们很笨拙、愚蠢或不感兴趣 —— 远非如此。

后来我意识到，这是因为从没有人教过他们这些看似简单的技能。他们在上学或做实习医生时见过的外科医生都非常专业，让一切看上去都很简单。我突然意识到，有一种知识，专家以为人人都懂，但不是专家的人却不知道这种知识的存在。迈克尔根本不是在为简单的问题苦苦挣扎。这件事对我来说很简单，只是因为我知道该怎么做。对他来说并非如此。我和他的理解之间有着很大的差距。

### 11.1 穿越「隐篱」

Crossing the ha-ha

I'll use a metaphor from landscape gardening to illustrate the gap that can stretch between teacher and student. In many eighteenth-century country estates, the large house and garden are set in extensive parkland stocked with animals. The curiously named ‘ha-ha' is a deep ditch between the garden and the surrounding park. Cattle and deer appear to come right up to the flowerbeds, creating an illusion that the house is in the midst of untamed nature. But the animals never eat the flowers – because they can't reach them. Viewed from the park, the sheer, brick-faced vertical wall of the ditch is obvious and unscalable. But viewed from the house, the ha-ha is invisible.

As experts, we are in the house, viewing an unbroken landscape that stretches across the park. When we see a novice some distance away, there seems no reason why they should not just walk a bit further and join us. But the novice is in the park, and from there the gulf to the house is impassable. When I was teaching Michael how to tie a surgical knot, he was in the park and I was in the house.

At this point on the path to becoming expert, you've made the transition from Journeyman to Master. You have passed through all the stages and reached the top of your field. You've become an expert, and now you want to pass on the knowledge you've gained. But it's often much more difficult than you expect. You have to make another transition, this time from doing things yourself to helping other people do them. This is something all teachers grapple with. In my case the subject was surgical techniques, but it's the same when it's a new computer program, a sport or a language. How can you bridge that ha-ha?

Thinking about Michael, help came from an unlikely quarter – the world of music. One day, between those minor surgery courses, I was having a harpsichord lesson with Sophie Yates. I've been learning with Sophie for over twenty years and she's an expert in every sense. She's a distinguished performer who gives concerts all over the world. She's a recording artist with a long list of credits. She often appears on the radio to discuss her passion for early music. And she's an expert teacher.

On this occasion, I was grappling with ornaments in a suite by François Couperin, the French baroque composer. Couperin's writing is all about detail and precision, about the placing of trills and the spacing of notes. Sophie's teaching, too, is all about detail – not vague instructions to ‘make it more expressive' or ‘loosen the rhythm', but specifics I can work with. She shows me tiny changes to timing, touch and finger position that make all the difference.

At the keyboard, I played the passage I'd been struggling with. Sophie listened, then asked me to play the first few bars again. She could tell what the problem was, but I couldn't, so she tried several approaches. She described what she wanted to hear, but I couldn't grasp what she meant. Then she demonstrated by playing the bar herself – now I could see her point and hear the difference, but I still couldn't do it myself. After trying a few approaches without success, Sophie put her hand over mine, made a minute adjustment to the angle of my wrist and suddenly things fell into place – a physical solution that couldn't be put into words.

Sophie had found a way to unlock my difficulty, to identify my problem and help me fix it. To me, this is the essence of ‘passing it on'. Passing it on is a conversation, a dialogue; not a one-way process. Sophie was building on her decades of experience to pinpoint what was relevant to me at that moment. She had to know how to play that passage herself, of course, but also how to convey it to me, how to find a point of connection. It wasn't about her demonstrating something she could do and I couldn't. That wouldn't help me learn. It was about me, her pupil, stuck at an earlier stage along the path. I realized that what I was trying to do as a teacher with the GPs was what Sophie was doing with me as a pupil. Sophie and I had both become experts in our fields, and now we were finding ways of passing it on.

For a long time, I'd seen music as an antidote to work, and it never occurred to me that there might be similarities between learning music and learning surgery. Yet if how you learn, rather than what you learn, becomes the focus, these examples become instances of the same thing – an expert teacher finding ways to help a learner to understand and to do. This communication cannot happen through books alone, or even through images. It takes place at the intersection between your body, another person's body and the physical world around you both. An expert teacher reveals unsayable things by demonstrating, and by highlighting whatever is crucial for you at that moment. A teacher must identify the problem which they and their student are trying to address.

I tried to work out Sophie's secret. Of course, she's gone through the same process as all the experts in this book. She's done her time, carried out her share of boring repetitive work. She's spent years practising scales, learning music theory, perfecting her performance technique, mastering repertoire and researching the history of her field.

In her teaching, Sophie starts by identifying one thing her student finds difficult, and working on that. Her ability to nail the problem is uncanny. Sometimes it's to do with understanding the structure of the music. Sometimes it's a technical issue, like a tiny change to the angle of one hand, a detail of fingering, or even just sitting closer to the keyboard. Sometimes it's something wider, such as needing to choose a different piece of music altogether.

Above all, Sophie listens. Then she translates her listening into action. In our lessons, she notices what I'm playing in a way that I can't, because I'm too close. She registers the details of articulation and phrasing which I miss, because I'm struggling with the mechanics of performance. My focus is on pressing the right keys in the right order at the right time. But Sophie doesn't only hear the notes I play. She notices the spaces between, the places where the music needs to breathe. She pinpoints what I'm grappling with and puts her finger on problems I haven't spotted. Her expert ears hear things I'm not aware of.

Dealing with technical issues is Sophie's starting point with me, because that's what I've framed as my problem and that's where I think I need help. But Sophie has a wider picture in her sights. She notices things that go beyond technical difficulty – things about my confidence and my approach to practice and performance. She guides me across terrain she has travelled but which I haven't yet encountered. I know that she has spent years in the stages I've described in this book, and now she's using that experience to help me.

Alan Spivey, one of my colleagues at Imperial, is professor of synthetic chemistry. He does something similar with the students on his course. They spend a lot of time learning facts and theories. They also learn laboratory skills and techniques by attending ‘practicals'. They have to be meticulous, noticing and documenting what they do in minute detail. Tiny changes can be the difference between success and failure when you're developing a new reaction. But technical accuracy is only part of the picture. As the students become more experienced, they design and carry out their own experiments to create and test novel compounds.

For Alan, being a synthetic chemist is about connecting practical work with an understanding of molecular structure and reactivity. He can zoom in on these structural details, then zoom out to their implications for experimental design. Not everyone can do this. Alan says his students don't always integrate their work in the lab with their theoretical knowledge. He tries to get them to think in the way he does – to think ‘like a chemist' as they move towards becoming research scientists themselves. It's a long process, and not all students get there. Many get stuck along the way.

我要用一个来自园艺领域的比喻来说明教师和学生之间的差距。在许多 18 世纪的乡村庄园里，大房子和花园都建在开阔的草地上，其间还有许多动物。「隐篱」这个奇怪的词，指的是花园与周围草地之间的一条深沟。牛群和鹿群似乎就在花圃旁边，制造了一种房子就建在野外的错觉。但是动物绝不会吃到花朵 —— 因为它们够不着。从周围的绿地看来，深沟垂直而陡峭的砖墙是显而易见、无法攀爬的；但从房屋那边来看，隐篱却是看不见的。

作为专家，我们就在屋子里，观赏着草地一览无余的美景。当我们看到一个远处的新手时，会觉得他们似乎没有任何理由不能再走近一点，到我们身边来。但是新手在草地上，从那里到房子之间有着不可逾越的鸿沟。在我教迈克尔如何打外科结时，他就在草地上，而我在屋子里。

在成为专家之路上走到这里，你已经完成了熟练工到大师的转变。你已经经历了所有的阶段，到达了你领域的巅峰。你已经成为专家，现在你想把你学到的知识传递下去，但这往往比你想象的难得多。你必须做出另一个转变，这次你要从自己动手做事转变为帮助别人做事。这是所有教师都在努力去做的事。我教的学科是外科技术，但对于教授新计算机程序、运动或语言来说，也是如此。你怎样才能在隐篱上搭建桥梁呢？

对于迈克尔，他从意想不到的地方得到了帮助 —— 音乐的世界。一天，在那些小手术课程的间隙里，我跟着索菲·耶茨（Sophie Yates）上了一节羽管键琴课。我向索菲学习已经有 20 多年了，从各种意义上看，她都是一个不折不扣的专家。她是一位杰出的演奏家，在世界各地举办音乐会。她是个唱片艺术家，发布了许许多多的作品。她经常在广播电台上谈论她对早期音乐的热爱。她还是一个专家级的教师。

这次与她上课的时候，我在努力练习法国巴洛克作曲家弗朗索瓦·库普兰（Francois Couperin）的一首组曲里的装饰音。库普兰的作品非常注重细节与准确性，注重颤音的位置和音符的间隔。索菲的教学也很注重细节 —— 而不是像「增强表现力」或「舒缓节拍」这样的模糊指示，而是我可以做的具体事项。她向我展示了弹奏的时机、细节与手指位置的细微变化，这些变化能产生巨大的影响。

在琴键前，我弹奏了那一段我一直不得要领的旋律。索菲听完后，让我再弹一遍前几小节。她能听出问题出在哪里，但我听不出来，于是她试了几种方法。她描述了她想听到的音乐，但我不明白她的意思。然后她自己演示了一遍那个小节 —— 现在我能明白她的意思了，也听出了其中的区别，但我自己还是弹不出来。索菲试了几种方法，都没有成功，她把手放在我手上，对我手腕的角度做了轻微的调整，突然一切都变得非常顺利了 —— 这是一种无法用语言表达的、身体上的解决方案。

索菲找到了一种方法来消除我的困难，找到我的问题，并帮助我解决问题。在我看来，这就是「传承技艺」的精髓。传承技艺是一种交流、一段对话，不是单向的过程。索菲用她几十年的经验找到了当时对我来说最重要的东西。当然，她必须知道如何弹奏这一段音乐，但也要知道如何把方法传达给我，如何找到达成理解的关键点。这件事的重点不在于她向我展示一些她能做而我不能做的事。那对我的学习没有帮助。这件事的重点是，我 —— 她的学生，在学习的早期阶段遇到了困难。我意识到，我作为全科医生的教师时所做的事情，正是索菲对作为学生的我所做的事情。索菲和我都已经成为我们各自领域的专家，而我们现在都在设法传承技艺。

很长一段时间以来，我把音乐看作对工作的调剂，从没想过学习音乐和学习外科之间有什么相似之处。然而，如果你把学习的方式（而不是学习的内容）作为焦点，这些不同的例子就成了一回事 —— 专家级的教师在设法帮助学习者去理解、去做事。这种交流不能仅通过书籍甚至图像来实现。这种交流发生在你与另一个人的身体，以及周围的物质世界之间。专家级的教师会通过示范、强调当时对你来说至关重要的事情，来揭示那些难以言喻的事情。教师必须找出他们和学生试图解决的问题。

我曾试图揭开索菲的秘密。当然，她和本书中所有的专家一样，都经历了相同的过程。她也曾积累经验，做过枯燥的重复性工作。她花了多年时间练习音阶、学习乐理、完善演奏技巧，掌握各种乐曲，研究自己领域的历史。

在教学的时候，索菲会首先找出一件学生觉得困难的事情，然后着手解决这个问题。她解决问题的能力是不可思议的。有时学生的问题在于难以理解音乐的结构，有时则是技术问题，如一只手的角度、手指的细节需要细微的调整，有时甚至只是需要坐得离琴键更近一些。有时问题则更宽泛，如需要另外选择不同的音乐。

最重要的是，索菲会倾听。然后她会把倾听转化为行动。在我们的课上，她会用一种独特的方式关注我的演奏，这种方式是我做不到的，因为我「当局者迷」。她能注意我弹错的音韵和分句的细节，因为我还在纠结于演奏的技术层面。我关注的重点是在正确的时间以正确的顺序按下正确的琴键。索菲不只听到了我弹奏的音符。她还听到了音符之间的间隙，音乐需要呼吸的地方。她会发现我有困难的地方，并指出我没有发现的问题。她专家级的耳朵能听到我没觉察到的东西。

处理技术问题是索菲和我的出发点，因为我认为那是我的问题所在，也是我认为我需要帮助的地方，但索菲的视野比我更宽广。她能注意到一些超越技术困难的东西 —— 我的自信、练习和演奏的方法。她引领我穿过她曾走过的，但我还没去过的地方。我知道她用了多年时间经历我在本书中描述的那些阶段，现在她在用那种经验来帮助我。

阿兰·斯皮维（Alan Spivey）是一名合成化学教授，他是我在帝国理工学院的一位同事。他也是这样教他课上的学生的。他们会花很多时间学习事实与理论。他们也会通过「实践课」来学习实验技能与技术。他们必须一丝不苟，详尽无遗地注意并记录他们做的每一件事。在学习新的化学反应时，细微的改变可能决定成败。但是，技术上的正确只是问题的一部分。随着学生越来越有经验，他们会设计并进行自己的实验，来制造和测试新的化合物。

对阿兰来说，一名合成化学家要把实际工作与对分子结构和反应性的理解结合在一起。他可以着眼于分子结构上的细节，也可以放眼于实验设计的影响。不是人人都能做到这一点。阿兰说，他的学生并不总是能把实验室里学到的东西与他们的理论知识结合起来。他会试着让学生按照他的方式来思考 —— 在他们成为科研工作者的过程中「像化学家」一样思考。这是一个漫长的过程，并不是所有学生都能做到。许多人在这个过程中都会陷入困境。

### 11.2 摆脱困境

Getting unstuck

‘Threshold concepts' are a useful way to think about this process. According to this theory, learning is not smooth but moves through stages, each a threshold to a deeper understanding. It requires a periodic reframing of your existing knowledge and culminates in thinking like an expert musician, scientist, doctor or craftsman, not just doing the things they do. But before that, there is a time when you struggle with ‘troublesome knowledge' – the sort of information that you might understand piecemeal, but can't put together into a coherent whole. Sometimes you might find yourself in a ‘stuck place'.

Some people can stay in a stuck place almost indefinitely. That's what had happened to my family doctor when I was starting out at medical school, who could never remember the names of all those little buggers in the neck. It's what happened to me when I tried to juggle with five balls, as I described in Chapter 3 . Both of us knew what we were trying to do. With juggling, I understood the physics; I knew where my hands were meant to be. But I hadn't mastered the doing. I'm still in that stuck place now, where I understand the elements but they haven't come together. I believe it's far more common than we realize, because people can perform at a high level without full comprehension. Being unable to remember the little buggers in the neck didn't undermine my doctor's ability to care for his patients, but it was a blind spot he had to work around. It's in circumstances like these, when a pupil already has some competence but can't slot things together, that a teacher is invaluable.

For Adrian, juggling with five balls was as easy as three balls eventually became for me. But for some reason I couldn't make the transition he'd made. Partly, this was my own fault. I didn't put in the time that would allow me to coordinate my body. However, Adrian might never have experienced that stuck place himself, and was therefore unable to identify my troublesome knowledge and help me past it. This was what I had found with Michael on the GP minor surgery course. I couldn't understand why he couldn't do what I was showing him, so I couldn't formulate a solution.

Jan Meyer and Ray Land, who developed the idea of threshold concepts, talk about the difficulty of integrating elements which don't yet hang together. Once you cross a threshold and move forward, things fall into place and you experience a different way of knowing – until you reach the next threshold. To do this you need help, and that's where teachers come in. Interestingly, the discomfort of coming to a new way of knowing rapidly disappears after you cross a threshold. That's why some teachers don't seem to understand why their students find things so difficult. The teachers are no longer struggling with what their students are struggling with.

Now that Joshua the tailor has become an expert, he can look back at his teachers and see what worked and what didn't – and then apply that experience to his interactions with his own apprentices. Ron the making tailor, Joshua's first master, was technically excellent but not a skilled teacher. He insisted on mimicry, making Joshua copy exactly what he did without explaining why. Ron had little tolerance for questioning, and took it as a personal affront if Joshua asked him why he did things in a particular way. He was critical without offering support. Though criticality is important, Ron's unwillingness to unpack his reasons meant that Joshua spent a lot of time not knowing what he was doing wrong.

Joshua's second master was Arthur, the cutting tailor. Arthur was completely different. He had a curious mind, and he wanted Joshua to develop one too. Generous with his time, he taught Joshua the foundations of his craft, allowing him to become free and independent. Arthur believed in graduated responsibility, and he only criticized when he thought it would help. Most of the time, he pointed out the positive aspects of Joshua's work. When he did give negative criticism, Joshua knew it was deserved. Above all, Arthur taught Joshua the principles of design and construction, and gave him the confidence to spread his wings.

Sharing your expertise with people less experienced than you is another shift from you to them, though this time the ‘them' refers to learners rather than audiences, customers or patients. Sometimes it's about teaching techniques or procedures, and tackling difficulties that block progress. Sometimes it's about encouraging learners to persevere during those dark times we all encounter along the way. Sometimes it's about helping them cope with the unexpected, recover from mistakes, build self-confidence or decide on a career path. This ability to teach, to coach and to inspire is easy to recognize but hard to define.

Back in my minor surgery courses, I struggled to explain to the GPs what I knew but couldn't seem to put into words. I tried giving lectures, where I described instruments and techniques in words. But that didn't work. Even a demonstration didn't solve the problem. With people like Michael, it was only in the practical sessions that things fell into place. There, I could see what each person was having difficulty with, and figure out how to help. I tried different ways of telling and showing. Often it took a few attempts before I hit upon something that worked.

Many of these doctors had chosen a career in general practice because they hadn't enjoyed surgery as a student or a junior doctor. Perhaps because of this, the surgeons they did work for hadn't ensured their learners understood the basics of operative surgery. Those more senior doctors had already crossed a ha-ha and no longer remembered how confusing an array of surgical instruments – such as needle-holders and artery forceps – can be. These instruments look similar, but they work completely differently. If you pick up a suture needle with artery forceps, the needle swivels round in parallel grooves in the instrument's jaws and you can't get a firm grip or place an accurate stitch. If you pick up a bleeding artery with a needle-holder, you crush the tissue and cause serious damage. Nobody tells you that. They just assume you know. But how can you, if you've never been shown?

In my minor surgery courses, I hadn't been able to convey the knowledge those learners needed. As a result, both they and I started to feel frustrated. Then I tried Sophie's approach. When I saw someone struggling to tie a knot or control a needle, I'd put my hand over theirs and show them how a tiny shift in the angle of their wrist could make all the difference. Once they felt it, things started to make sense.

「门槛概念」是思考这个过程的有效方法。根据这种理论，学习不是一帆风顺的，而要经历不同的阶段，每一阶段都有一个加深理解的门槛。这就需要你定期重构自己现有的知识，学会像专家级的音乐家、科学家、医生或工匠一样思考，而不仅仅是做他们所做的事情。但在此之前，你会在一段时间内纠结于「困难的知识」—— 你可能对这些信息有些零散的理解，但不能将这些理解组成一个连贯的整体。有时你可能会觉得自己陷入了「困境」。

有些人可能会一直待在困境里。在我刚上医学院的时候，当时我的家庭医生就是如此，他总是记不住脖子里的那些小东西的名称。我在第 3 章说过，我曾试图抛接五个球，当时我也遇到了这样的事情。我们俩都知道我们要做什么。玩杂要时，我懂得其中的物理原理，知道手应该放在哪里，但我没有掌握做的方法。我现在依然没摆脱那个困境：我了解各种要素，但各要素无法结合在一起。我认为这种现象比我们意识到的要普遍得多，因为大家可以在没有充分理解的情况下表现出很高的专业水平。记不住脖子里的小东西，并不会影响我那位医生照顾患者的能力，但那是一个需要他绕开的盲点。一个学生已经有了一些能力，但还不能把各种知识融会贯通，在这种情况下，教师是无价的。

对阿德里安来说，抛接五个球就像我后来抛接三个球一样简单。但不知什么原因，我无法完成他经历的那种转变。这在一定程度上是我的原因。我没有投入足够的时间，来协调自己的身体。然而，阿德里安自己可能从没有经历过那种困境，因此不能指出那些让我感到困难的知识，帮助我摆脱困境。这就是我在全科医生的小手术课程中给迈克尔授课时遇到的困难。

我不明白他为什么做不到我演示的东西，所以我想不出解决方案。简·迈耶（Jan Meyer）和雷·兰德（Ray Land）提出了「门槛概念」，他们谈到过整合尚未联系在一起的元素有多困难。

一旦你跨过一道门槛，继续前进，一切都会变得井然有序，你也会体验到一种不同的认知方式 —— 直到你遇到下一个门槛为止。你需要帮助才能做到这一点，这就是教师的作用。有趣的是，一旦你跨过门槛，那种新的认知方式带来的不适感就会迅速消失。这就是为什么有些教师似乎不能理解学生的困难。这些教师已经不再为学生所面临的困境而苦恼了。

裁缝约书亚已经成了一位专家，所以他可以回过头来看看他的老师，看看哪些做法有用，哪些没用 —— 然后将这种经验应用到他与学徒的互动中。制作裁缝罗恩是约书亚的第一任师父，他技术精湛，但不是一个高明的教师。他坚持模仿教学法，让约书亚模仿他做的每件事，却不解释为什么。罗恩很难容忍别人提问，如果约书亚问他为什么要用某种特定方式做事，他就会受到冒犯。他总是批评而不给予支持。虽然批评很重要，但罗恩不愿解释自己的理由，这意味着约书亚在很长时间里都不知道自己做错了什么。

约书亚的第二任师父是剪裁裁缝亚瑟。亚瑟与罗恩完全不同。他有一颗好奇的心，希望约书亚也能如此。他不吝惜自己的时间，把自己的手艺基础倾囊相授，让约书亚变得自由、独立。亚瑟相信循序渐进地赋予责任，才更有利于学生的进步。

他只在他认为对学生有帮助的时候才会批评。大多数情况下，他会指出约书亚作品里的积极方面。在他真的提出负面批评时，约书亚就会意识到他批评到了点上。最重要的是，亚瑟把设计与制衣的原则教给了约书亚，并给了他展翅高飞的信心。

与经验不如你的人分享你的专业知识，是另一种「从你到他们」的转变，不过这种转变中的「他们」，指的是学习者而不是观众、顾客或患者。有时这个过程的重点在于教学技巧或流程，以及解决阻碍进步的困难。有时重点在于鼓励学习者在人人都会遇到的困难时期坚持下去。还有时候，重点在于帮助他们应对意想不到的事情、纠正错误、培养自信或决定职业道路。

我们很容易看到这种教育、辅导和激励他人的能力，但很难给出定义。

回到我的小手术课程上。我当时在努力向全科医生解释一些我知道但难以用语言表达的东西。我试图讲解，用文字描述器械与技术，但那不管用。即使做演示也不能解决问题。对于像迈克尔这样的人来说，只有在实践课中，问题才会得到解决。

在这种课上，我可以看到每个人遇到的困难，并想出如何帮助他们。我尝试了几种不同的讲述和演示方法。我通常需要试过几次才能找到有用的方法。

这些医生中的许多人选择做全科医生，是因为他们在上学或做实习医生的时候不喜欢外科。也许正因为如此，指导他们的外科医生没有确保他们掌握外科手术的基本知识。那些更加资深的医生已经跨过了「隐篱」，不再记得那些乱七八糟的手术器械（如持针器、动脉钳）有多让人困惑。这些器械看起来很相似，但用法完全不同。如果你用动脉钳去持缝合针，针就会在动脉钳的凹槽里旋转，你既夹不紧针，也不能做精准的缝合。如果你用持针器去夹流血的动脉，你就会夹碎血管组织，造成严重的损伤。没有人会告诉你这些。他们只会觉得你应该知道。可是如果从没有人给你讲过这些，你怎么会知道呢？

在我讲授小手术课程的时候，我没能传达那些学习者需要的知识。因此，他们和我都开始感到沮丧。然后我试了试索菲的办法。当我看到有人不会打结或难以控制缝合针时，我就会把手放在他们的手上，向他们展示手腕角度的微小变化如何带来巨大的改变。一旦感觉到了不同，他们就明白了。

### 11.3 两匹斑马招惹了我的猫

‘Two Zebras Buggered My Cat'

Having gone through the stages of becoming an expert doesn't mean you can remember what it was like at the time. Being an expert yourself doesn't necessarily mean you can teach other people. You can't pass on your experience to someone else before they've completed at least some of the steps themselves. And it takes insight, imagination, empathy and humility to put yourself back on the other side of the ha-ha.

I experienced this at the start of my career when I became an anatomy demonstrator at the University of Manchester, where I'd been a medical student. Nobody explained the teaching part of being a demonstrator, so I had to learn on the job. By that time I'd qualified as a doctor and had spent a year in a hospital as a houseman, working flat out to look after the patients on my ward. The prospect of teaching anatomy came as a welcome change. For one thing, I wouldn't be looking after patients, which meant a whole year without being on call. No more getting bleeped throughout the night to re-site drips and unblock catheters.

But demonstrating anatomy was a steep learning curve. The academics in the department assumed I'd ‘just know' how to teach. But I didn't. Every week I'd take four different groups through the same part of the body. Each group of ten students had their own cadaver, and they would spend the morning or afternoon dissecting. Though my own focus was on the surgical exams I was preparing for, I knew that my main role in the department was to teach those first-year undergraduates. Much of what I was going to be tested on in my surgical exams wasn't relevant to them and I had to avoid cluttering up their minds with excessive detail. My job was to ‘demonstrate', to show them what they would need to know as doctors, to be a guide.

Becoming a guide wasn't just about conveying anatomical knowledge or the techniques of dissection. It was about understanding what the students were struggling with. In the process, I developed my voice as a teacher of anatomy. I tried to put myself back in their position. That wasn't too difficult, as I was only one step ahead of them with my anatomical knowledge. So I shared things I'd found helpful, like the colourful mnemonics I'd learned when I was a student. Some of these have stayed with me ever since, like a burr in a hiking sock. Although I'd struggle now to remember the five terminal branches of the facial nerve in isolation (temporal, zygomatic, buccal, marginal mandibular, cervical), Two Zebras Buggered My Cat has never left me.

I found that one of the biggest challenges as a teacher is deciding what not to point out. It's easy to swamp a learner with long lists, but less is often more. The art of teaching is to find one or two things which need to be improved upon – and which the learner can do something about – then leave the rest for another day. That's what Sophie does in her harpsichord lessons. She doesn't focus on obvious things like fumbled scale passages or wrong notes, because she knows they can be fixed later. Instead, she points out things I haven't noticed.

That's what Arthur the cutting tailor was teaching Joshua too. He wasn't concerned about small-scale glitches, or things that could be easily remedied. His focus was on Joshua's grasp of tailoring principles.

Each of these experienced teachers homed in on a single thing at a time that could be done better. Each of them did it in a way that helped their student move forward and build their confidence. Each of them was demonstrating care.

Much later, I became familiar with the work of Lev Vygotsky, the Soviet psychologist whose theories have had a profound impact on my own approach to learning. Vygotsky died in 1934, and for decades his work remained relatively unknown in the West, but over the years his ideas about social constructivism have become increasingly influential. One of his concepts is the ‘zone of proximal development' or ZPD. The idea here is that any learner comes with things they can already do. At the same time, there are whole areas that are completely out of reach. In between are things they can achieve with expert help but cannot do on their own. That's the ZPD. Here the role of a teacher is pivotal, giving people support when they need it, and having the sensitivity to back off when they are no longer required. Nobody wants someone breathing down their neck while they are practising something they're getting the hang of but which just needs more work. A skilful teacher provides temporary scaffolding, like a skyscraper under construction. As soon as the building is strong enough to take its own weight, the scaffolding can be dismantled.

Sophie was working with me in my ZPD when she was adjusting the position of my hand at the keyboard; she gave me a new insight which I could work on by myself. I was joining my students in their ZPD when I was an anatomy demonstrator, and again when teaching GPs to do minor surgery. Clive, my wise tutor, did something similar when the other doctors and I were watching one another's video consultations in Chapter 8 . Whatever your area of work, having someone who can support you in your own ZPD is essential. And becoming skilled in recognizing the boundaries of a learner's ZPD is part of passing it on.

When Arthur the cutting tailor was nearing retirement, he encouraged Joshua to take on more responsibility. One day, he said, ‘The next new customer who comes in, you can have.' After an initial meeting with this new customer, Joshua arranged an appointment for the next fitting. But then the man came in to explain that he needed his suit to be made very quickly, for an important family occasion. At that point, Joshua expected Arthur to take over. But he didn't. Instead, he said, ‘Well, you'll have to work fast then, won't you,' and left Joshua to get on with it. By gauging the extent of Joshua's ZPD, Arthur gave him the confidence he needed to work under pressure. Arthur was able to let go.

As a teacher, you can't be in control forever. At a certain point you have to hand over; constantly standing over someone doesn't help. You can't keep telling people how to do things, and you can't force them to do things your way. You have to allow your students or the people in your team to get things wrong, to take responsibility for their mistakes. That's how they'll learn. Passing it on requires you to be there when you're needed, and to fade into the background when you're not.

经历过成为专家的各个阶段，并不意味着你能记起当时的情况。成为一个专家并不意味着你可以做别人的老师。如果他们自己没有完成其中的一些步骤，你就没法把自己的经验传递给他们。要让自己回到「隐篱」的另一边，还需要洞察力、想象力、共情能力以及谦卑。

在我职业生涯刚刚开始的时候，我在母校曼彻斯特大学当过解剖学助教，当时我就有过这种体会。没有人向我解释作为助教应该如何教学，所以我必须在工作中学习。当时我已经取得了医师资格，并且在医院里当了一年实习医生，为照顾病房里的患者忙得不可开交。教授解剖学算是一个不错的改变。其一，我不用照顾患者，这意味着不用一整年随叫随到。其二，我再也不用半夜被呼机吵醒，去重新插静脉滴注套管、疏通导尿管。

但是学做解剖学助教很难。系里的学者认为我「只知道」如何教书，但其实我连这都不懂。我每周都要带领四组学生学习人体的同一个部位。每组学生都有自己要解剖的尸体，他们会利用上午或下午的时间解剖尸体。虽然我自己的关注重点是我正在复习的外科考试，但我知道我在系里的主要任务是给一年级的本科生教学。我的外科考试中要考的大部分内容都与他们无关，我必须避免用过多的细节把他们搞糊涂。我的任务是「展示」，向他们展示作为医生需要知道的东西，做一个向导。做向导并不仅仅是传授解剖学知识或解剖技术，还要理解学生的问题。在这个过程中，我找到了我作为解剖学教师的「声音」。我试着站在他们的角度思考问题。这并不难，因为我的解剖学知识只比他们强一点。于是我分享了一些我觉得有用的东西，比如我在学生时代学到的有趣的记忆法。有些记忆法一直留在我的脑海里，就像登山袜里残留的刺果一样。虽然我现在很难单独回忆起面神经的五个末梢分支 —— 颞支（temporal）、 颧支（zygomatic）、颊支（buccal）、下颌缘支（marginal mandi-bular）、颈支（cervical），但我从没忘记它们的首字母组合在一起的顺口溜「两匹斑马招惹了我的猫」（Two Zebras Buggered My Cat）.

我发现，作为一名教师，最大的挑战之一就是决定不指出哪些错误。喋喋不休很容易让学习者不知所措，所以说得越少越好。教学的艺术在于找到一两个需要改进的地方 —— 学习者可以努力的地方，然后剩下的问题改天再说。索菲在她的羽管键琴课上就是这样做的。她从不关注显而易见的事情，如不熟练的音阶或者弹错的音符，因为她知道这些问题可以以后改善。相反，她会指出一些我没有注意到的问题。

剪裁裁缝亚瑟就是这样教约书亚的。他不关心小问题，也不关心能轻易改正的错误。他关注的是约书亚对剪裁原则的掌握。

每个有经验的教师每次都会专注于一件可以改善的事情。他们每个人做这件事的方式，都既能帮助学生进步，也能帮助他们建立信心。他们每个人都表现出了关心。

很久以后，我开始熟悉列夫·维果茨基（Lev Vygotsky）的著作。这位苏联心理学家的理论对我的学习方法产生了深远的影响。维果茨基于 1934 年去世。几十年来，他的著作在西方的影响相对较小，但在后来的许多年里，他关于社会建构主义的思想越来越有影响力。「最近发展区」就是他提出的概念之一。这个理论认为，任何学习者来学习的时候，都有已经会做的事情。与此同时，还有些领域是他们完全不会的。在这两种事情之间，还有些事情是他们可以在专家的帮助下做到，但无法独立完成的。这就是最近发展区。此时教师的角色是至关重要的，即在他人需要的时候给予支持，在他们不需要支持时懂得后退一步。在练习某些已经掌握了窍门、只需要更多练习的事情时，没有人喜欢别人一直在旁边盯着他们。老练的教师会提供临时的「脚手架」，就像在修建摩天大楼一样。一旦建筑物足够坚固，能够承受自身重量，脚手架就可以拆除了。

当索菲调整我的手在琴键上的位置时，就是在我的最近发展区内教学。她给了我一种新的见解，让我可以自行理解。在我做解剖学助教时，以及后来教全科医生做小手术的时候，都是在最近发展区内与学生相会。当我和其他医生观看彼此的问诊录像时（第 8 章），我智慧的导师克莱夫也做了类似的事情。

无论你在哪个领域内学习，有人在你的最近发展区内提供支持是至关重要的。学会认清学习者最近发展区的边界，也是传承技艺的一部分。

在剪裁裁缝亚瑟即将退休的时候，他鼓励约书亚承担更多的责任。有一天，他说：「下一个新顾客来的时候，就由你来负责。」在与这位新顾客初次见面后，约书亚就为下次试穿约好了时间。但到了那个时候，这个人进店就说，他需要尽快做好这套西装，因为他准备穿这套衣服参加一个重要的家庭活动。这时，约书亚希望亚瑟能把这单任务接过去，但亚瑟没有这样做。

相反，他说：「既然这样，你最好加把劲儿，不是吗？」说完，就让约书亚去干活了。亚瑟估计了约书亚最近发展区的大小，给了他在压力下工作所需的信心。亚瑟懂得如何放手。

作为教师，你不可能永远掌控一切。到了某个时间，你就必须放手；一直手把手地监控别人是帮不了他的。你不能一直告诉别人该怎么做，你不能强迫他们按照你的方式做事。你必须允许你的学生或团队成员犯错，允许他们为自己的错误承担责任。这是他们学习的方式。传承技艺需要你在别人需要的时候出现，不需要的时候退到一旁。

### 11.4 地图与向导

Maps and guides

So what does ‘passing it on' entail? What is this final step on the journey to becoming expert, when you become a Master and take responsibility for the learning of others? To me, it's a combination of being a guide, a mentor and a coach. To explain this, I'll use the metaphor of a map.

Throughout your progression towards becoming expert, you need help in finding the way. In the early stages of doing time you need instruction in specific tasks. That's how things work when you're an Apprentice. This is like using the satnav on your mobile phone when you're delivering a parcel in a city. You have to get from where you are to where you're going, and the system tells you how to do that. It doesn't ask you to think, but expects you to follow its directions. A voice in your ear says, ‘In two hundred yards, turn left.' If you follow the instructions closely enough, you will almost certainly get to the right place. But you'll have no idea of how your route fits into the wider landscape. At this point, that doesn't matter – provided you do what you're told, you'll have done what's expected of you.

When Joshua was making pocket flaps, when Fabrice was sweeping hair from the salon floor and when I was doing the bloods, we were all following instructions. We were all using our satnav. Nobody was interested in whether we grasped the bigger picture. They just wanted us to do the tasks they had given us. Our masters would check that we were doing the tasks they specified, but that was all.

Later, as you start to understand more about the work, satnav instructions aren't enough. You need a map. You're developing a sense of where to go, and you realize there are different ways to get there. With a physical journey, you might start with a road atlas that marks out routes schematically. That helps you pick a route as you go from one part of the country to another. These are the sort of maps I encountered as a medical student, setting out the canon I needed to memorize and refer to. But that detailed information about anatomy, physiology, diseases and their treatments seemed out of context at first, unrelated to anything I'd encountered in real life. It was the same with Joshua, whose pocket flaps didn't make much sense until they became part of a jacket.

At first it seemed a morass of information and I couldn't pick out what was important from what wasn't. That's where lecturers, tutors and anatomy demonstrators come in. You need help to check that your route makes sense.

Once you set out, it's helpful to see the terrain in more detail. You move from a road atlas to an Ordnance Survey (OS) map. OS maps show hills, rivers, buildings and fields, as well as roads and footpaths. But although you can plan where you're going, even an OS map doesn't tell you what you'll find when you get there. You'll be dealing with all kinds of things that aren't on the map at all – recent buildings, or changes to stiles and fences. You'll grapple with bad weather, getting lost, becoming tired, and all the other challenges of a cross-country trip. And you'll have to interpret all that as you go, integrating the knowledge from the map with what you find when you get there.

People who make maps are not always the ones who use them, and they don't always give you the information you need. An experienced walker who knows a region well needs much less in the way of contextual detail than a newcomer to the area. That leads to those infuriating sketches that only make sense if you're in the head of the person who has drawn them. If you miss a gate or a stile or take a wrong turning, you're off the map, without the information you need in order to recognize where you are and get back on track.

Guidebooks or instruction manuals can be useful here, but people writing guidebooks often make assumptions about what a reader will know. I read one recently that said ‘cross the next field, heading towards a piebald horse under a beech tree'. The author must have lapsed into an assumption that the landscape he saw that day was fixed and static.

Thinking that other people will know what is in your mind is a mistake that's surprisingly easy to make. It's like those teachers who get exasperated because a learner doesn't seem able to grasp the point. In fact, it is the responsibility of the teacher to recognize and adjust to the level of knowledge and understanding a learner comes with, rather than starting with what the teacher wants to teach. Here, you need more than a map or a guidebook. You need a human guide.

As you move along your path you'll often find that your maps don't work. When I became a GP, most of mine turned out to be useless. As a surgeon, I'd spent years treating patients who had been sorted by someone else and whose problems had been defined as ‘surgical'. Suddenly, as a GP, I was the first port of call. Not only did I have to remember things I'd learned at medical school a decade earlier and promptly forgotten, but I had to find my way in a new landscape.

Sometimes my patients would have a serious condition that needed immediate action. Then I felt on firm ground. More often, though, they had common, self-limiting problems that weren't particularly serious and would settle down on their own. At first it was difficult to tell the difference, and often I overreacted. I mistook straightforward things I hadn't encountered before for problems that needed referral. But a lot of the time I couldn't pigeonhole my patients at all. They'd say things like, ‘I don't know what it is, Doctor, but I just don't feel right', or the classic ‘I feel tired all the time'. I didn't know what the problem was, and neither did they. I struggled to distinguish between diagnostic signal and noise. The maps I'd come with didn't make sense. I needed a guide.

A guide has travelled the route you're on and knows what to expect. They can tell you if you're drifting off the path, and show you how to get back. As a surgeon, my guides were the consultants I worked for, the doctors in my community of practice, and the nurses and other professionals who helped me learn. But although a guide has responsibility for making sure you reach where you've said you want to go, that's where their responsibility ends. Provided you get to your destination safely, their job is over. Deciding what to do when you get there, or where to go next, is not their concern. For that, you need more than a guide. You need a mentor, perhaps even a coach.

So far I've talked about journeys as if the destination is already decided. But as you become independent, moving from Apprentice to Journeyman to Master, you have to make a lot of decisions. As well as moving ‘from you to them' and developing your voice, you have to choose where to go. It's here that you need someone who cares for you as a person. A mentor does exactly that.

That's what I was fortunate to have when I became a GP trainee, and again with Clive, my trainer. That's what Joshua experienced with Arthur, his inspirational cutting tailor. That's what I hear from all the experts I've met. Passing it on goes far beyond providing training in techniques or procedures. Passing it on means nurturing and supporting someone as they move along a path that you yourself have followed.

But maps are never neutral. They present what the map-maker wants to show you, which isn't necessarily what you need to know. A good mentor will teach you to be sceptical about maps and to use your judgement in interpreting them. In his 1977 book A Guide for the Perplexed , the economist E. F. Schumacher describes his experience with maps during the time of the Cold War:

On a visit to Leningrad some years ago, I consulted a map to find out where I was, but I could not make it out. From where I stood, I could see several enormous churches, yet there was no trace of them on my map. When finally an interpreter came to help me, he said: ‘We don't show churches on our maps.' Contradicting him, I pointed to one that was very clearly marked. ‘That is a museum,' he said, ‘not what we call a "living church". It is only the "living churches" that we don't show.'

It then occurred to me that this was not the first time I had been given a map that failed to show many things I could see right in front of my eyes. All through school and university I had been given maps of life and knowledge on which there was hardly a trace of many of the things that I most cared about and that seemed to me to be of the greatest possible importance for the conduct of my life. I remembered that for many years my perplexity had been complete; and no interpreter had come along to help me. It remained complete until I ceased to suspect the sanity of my perceptions and began, instead, to suspect the soundness of the maps.

那么「传承技艺」意味着什么？在你成为大师之后，开始人为其他人的学习负责的时候，成为专家之路的最后一步又是什么？在我看来，这最后一步就是成为向导、导师和教练的结合体。我会用地图的比喻来解释这一点。

在你成为专家的过程中，你需要一些帮助才能找到方向。在积累的早期阶段，你需要在具体任务上得到指导。这就是你在做学徒时的情况。这就好像你在城市里派送包裹，需要使用手机上的卫星导航系统一样。你要从你现在的位置前往目的地，而这个系统会告诉你怎么走。它不会要求你思考，而是要求你按照它的指示去做。你的耳机里会有个声音说：「两百米后左转。」如果你严格按照指示前进，就几乎肯定会到达正确的地方。但是，你不知道你的前进路线与更广阔的环境之间的关系。此时，这并不重要 —— 只要你做了别人要你做的事，你就达到了别人对你的期待。

约书亚在做袋盖的时候，法布里斯在清扫美发店地板上的头发时，以及我在采血的时候，我们都在按照指示行事。我们都在使用自己的卫星导航系统。没有人在乎我们是否了解全局。他们只想让我们完成他们交给我们的任务。我们的师父会检查我们是否在做他们指定的任务，但仅此而已。

后来，当你更了解工作的时候，卫星导航的指示就不够了。你需要一幅地图。你意识到了自己要去哪里，你意识到有不同的路线都可以通向那里。对于现实中的旅行，你可能会先看看道路地图，然后大致标出路线。当你在国内旅行的时候，这样可以帮你选择路线。我在学医时见到的都是这样的「地图」，其中列出了我需要记忆和参考的标准信息。但是书中那些关于解剖学、生理学、疾病及其治疗方法的详细信息，起初似乎有些不着边际，与我在现实生活中遇到的任何东西都没有关系。约书亚也有同感，直到他做的袋盖成为西装上衣的一部分之后，才有了意义。

起初，我接触的信息像是乱糟糟的沼泽，我分不清哪些是重要的，哪些不是。这就是讲师、导师和解剖学助教的工作了。你需要一些帮助来检查你的前进路线是否正确。一旦你踏上旅程，更详细地观察地形地貌是很有帮助的。

你需要放下道路地图，参考地形测量图。地形测量图标出了丘陵、河流、建筑物和田野，以及道路和小径。你要应对各种没在地图上标出来的东西 —— 新修的建筑、改变的阶梯和栅栏。

你要与坏天气、迷路、疲惫和其他越野旅行的挑战作斗争。你必须一边走一边应付这一切，把地图上的知识和你在路上发现的东西结合起来。

制作地图的人并不一定是使用地图的人，他们并非总能给你需要的信息。熟悉一个地区的、有经验的旅行者需要的环境细节信息比新来的人少得多。这就导致他们画的草图非常令人恼火，只有了解这些绘图人是怎么想的，这些地图才有意义。

如果你错过了一扇门、一道阶梯，或者拐错了一个弯，你就脱离了地图的指引，缺乏必要的信息帮助你辨别方位，找到正轨。

此时，指南或操作手册可能很有帮助，但撰写这些指南的人经常对读者的知识怀有一些假设。我最近读到的一本旅行指南说：「穿过下一片田野，走向一棵山毛榉树下的花斑马。」作者一定误以为他那天看到的景色是固定不变的。

以为别人知道你脑子里的东西，是一个人们很容易犯的错误。那些因为学生不得要领而恼火的老师就是这样的。事实上，了解并适应学习者的知识和理解水平是教师的责任，教师不能从自己想教的东西开始教起。在这种情况下，学生需要的不只是一幅地图或一本旅行指南。你需要一个做向导的人。

当你沿着道路前进的时候，你会经常发现手上的地图不管用。在我成为全科医生的过程中，我的大部分「地图」都是没用的。作为一名外科医生，我花了多年时间治疗那些被别人分好类的患者，他们的问题都被定义为「外科问题」。突然间，我成了全科医生，成了患者的第一个求助对象。我不仅要回想起十年前在医学院学过，但很快就忘记的东西，还要在新的领域里找到自己的方向。

有时我的患者病得很重，需要立即接受治疗。那时，我心里反而感到很踏实。但在更多的时候，他们有一些常见的、自限性疾病，这些问题并不严重，会自行好转。一开始我很难分辨两种疾病的区别，而且常常反应过度。我会把我从没见过的简单问题当作需要转介的疾病。然而在许多情况下，我完全不知道怎么给我的患者分类。他们会说「医生，我不知道是怎么回事，只是觉得不舒服」或者「我总是觉得很累」这样的老生常谈。我不知道问题出在哪里，他们也不知道。我很难分辨诊断信号与噪声。我带来的地图没有任何借鉴意义。我需要一个向导。

向导已经走过了你所走的道路，他们知道会发生什么。如果你偏离了正确的方向，他们会提醒你，并告诉你如何返回。做外科医生时，我的向导就是我的上级顾问医师、我实践社群里的医生，以及帮助我学习的护士和其他专业人士。但是，尽管向导有责任确保你到达你说过你想去的地方，但他们的责任也仅限于此。只要你安全地到达目的地，他们的任务就结束了。到达目的地之后你决定做什么，或者接下来去哪里，都不是他们关心的问题。对于这些问题，你需要的不只是一个向导。你需要一个导师，甚至是一个教练。

到目前为止，我一直在谈论旅行，就好像目的地已经确定了一样。但随着你独立自主，从学徒变为熟练工，再变为大师，你必须做出很多决定。除了做出「从你到他们」的转变，找到自己的「声音」，你还必须选择去往哪里。此时你需要一个关心你的人。导师正是这样的人。在我成为一名全科医生培训师的时候，我很幸运能有这样的导师，也很幸运能遇上我的培训师克莱夫。这就是约书亚师从亚瑟 —— 鼓舞他的剪裁裁缝时所体验到的感受。我见过的所有专家都讲到过这样的经历。传承技艺远不止是提供技术或操作流程方面的培训。传承技艺意味着在学生走上你曾走过的道路时，给予他们照顾与支持。

然而地图从来不是中立客观的，它们呈现的是制图者想要告诉你的东西，而不一定是你需要知道的东西。好的导师会教你对地图保持怀疑的态度，用自己的判断来解读地图。经济学家 E. F. 舒马赫（E.F.Schumacher）在他 1977 年出版的《解惑：心智模式决定你的一生》（A Guide for the Perplexed）一书中讲述了他在冷战时期使用地图的经历：

几年前来列宁格勒的时候，我查了查地图，想知道我在哪儿，但我却查不出来。从我站立的地方，我能看见几座巨大的教堂，然而我在地图上却找不到它们的踪影。终于有一位翻译来帮我了，他说：「我们不把教堂标在地图上。」我指着一个明显的标记，对他的说法提出异议。「那是一座博物馆，」他说，「不是我们所说的‘活教堂'。只有‘活教堂'不会被标出来。」

然后我想到，曾经有人给过我一张地图，上面没有显示我眼前看到的许多东西，这种事不是第一次发生了。在中学和大学里，我一直得到的都是生活和知识的地图。在这些地图上，几乎找不到我最关心的、对我的人生来说可能是最重要的东西。我记得许多年来，我一直百思不得其解，却从来没有翻译前来帮我。

直到我不再怀疑我的感知，转而开始怀疑地图的可靠性，我的困惑才开始消解。

### 11.4 出乎意料

Going off-piste

Back with Michael on the minor surgery course, he suddenly sees what I'm getting at. He moves his hand a fraction, and something falls into place. Now he can tie that knot, get that suture tension just right. But he's still finding it more difficult than I expected. During a coffee break I ask him what he thinks the problem is.

He tells me that ever since childhood he's struggled with being clumsy, but he thought it was just how he was. It's only recently that he's had some tests which show he's got mild dyspraxia, a developmental disorder of coordination. It never occurred to me that there might be an underlying physical reason for Michael's problems with handling instruments and tying knots. I realize that passing it on isn't just about telling people things you know, or showing them things you can do. It's about putting yourself in their position and walking beside them on their path to becoming expert. Passing it on is not about me as a teacher, but about Michael and what he needs.

In the final chapter, I'll ask why experts matter to all of us.

回到迈克尔的小手术课上。他突然明白了我的意思。他的手稍稍动了一下，事情就恢复了正常。现在他会打结了，能够让缝合部位保持恰到好处的张力，但他还是觉得这比我想象中的难。在一次喝咖啡的休息时间里，我问他觉得问题出在哪里。

他告诉我，他从小就笨手笨脚，但他认为他就是这个样子。·直到最近，他才做了一些测试，结果表明他有轻度的运动障碍（一种发育性协调障碍）。我根本没想到，迈克尔在使用器械和打结方面的问题可能有潜在的身体原因。我意识到，传承技艺不仅是告诉别人你知道的事情，或者向他们展示你能做的事情，而是要设身处地为他们着想，在他们成为专家的旅途中与他们同行。传承技艺的重点不在于我这个老师，而在于迈克尔和他的需求。

在最后一章，我会提出这个问题：为什么专家对于我们所有人都很重要？

## 1201. 专家的重要性

1201 Why experts matter

When I noticed damp in my house, I called Richard, an expert recommended by a friend. Richard listened as I described the problem, then walked around my basement and peered at the walls and the floor. He got out a meter and took some readings. After collecting his thoughts, he outlined what he saw as the issue, suggested some possible approaches, and recommended the option he thought best. Rather to my surprise, it turned out to be one of the less expensive ones.

I asked Richard how he'd decided what to advise. He explained that he'd been in the business for almost forty years, and had worked in a lot of houses like mine. He'd seen similar problems many times and tried all kinds of solutions. Although some new materials and technologies had recently become available, he felt that a conservative approach would work best in my case. He believed that what he suggested would fix the problem, though he didn't know for certain. If it didn't, there were other avenues we could explore. We agreed to go ahead on that basis.

At that point, I had no direct evidence of Richard's technical skills, though my friend had said they were excellent. My relationship was with Richard as a person – as an expert in his field. Richard had started by identifying my problem. He wasn't thinking only of meter readings, and he wasn't out for a short-term profit. Instead, he used his experience to suggest a way forward that made sense to us both. I trusted him and what he said, because I believed he was an expert. Richard did what I do as a clinician, what Joshua does as a tailor, and what the other experts in this book are so good at.

我发现我的房子受潮了，于是打电话给理查德，他是一个朋友推荐给我的专家。理查德听我讲完我的问题，然后在地下室里走来走去，检查墙壁和地板。他掏出一个仪表，测量了一下读数。整理好思路后，他概述了他认为的问题，提出了一些可能的解决方法，并推荐了他认为最好的选择。让我颇为惊讶的是，这种选择竟然是比较便宜的一种。

我问理查德，他是如何决定该提什么建议的。他解释说，他在这一行干了将近 40 年，维修过许多像我家这样的房子。类似的问题他见过许多次，尝试过各种各样的解决办法。虽然近来出现了一些新的材料和技术，但他觉得保守的方法对我的问题来说是最好的。虽然不能确定，但他相信自己的建议能解决问题。如果问题没有解决，我们还可以探索其他途径。我们决定就这么办。

尽管我朋友说理查德非常优秀，但当时我没有直接的证据证明他的技术水平。我和理查德的关系是人与人的关系 —— 他是他领域里的一个专家。理查德先是发现了我的问题。接下来他并没有只考虑仪表读数，也没有追求短期利益。相反，他运用了自己的经验，提出了一种我们俩都赞同的方法。我相信他和他说的话。理查德做的事，就是我作为医生、约书亚作为裁缝所做的事，以及本书其他专家所擅长的事。

### 12.1 专家说的话

What the experts say

We all need experts like Richard because we rely on what they do; when we have problems, we need experts to fix them. When we are ill, we need doctors. When we fly, we need pilots. When we have a problem in our basement, we need specialists in treating damp. Yet the talk today about experts often leaves me angry. In this final chapter, I'll explain why.

I often hear experts dismissed as irrelevant – no longer of value in a rapidly changing world. I hear them written off as a useless elite. Yet nothing could be further from the truth, as we all realize when we are sick, or on an aeroplane, or find damp in our house.

But the services which experts provide are only part of their importance. Becoming expert is at the core of being human. It doesn't matter if we end up as an expert, recognized by our peers and the wider world – what matters is that we become better at whatever we strive to achieve. Whatever our interests, devoting years to something worthwhile meets a deep need: to immerse ourselves in something bigger than we are.

In this book, I've tracked the internal processes of becoming expert. These processes are less often written about than the declarative knowledge or component skills of ‘expertise'. Partly that's because knowledge and skill are easier to demonstrate and test. But it's also because, as an insider, it's easy to lose sight of the stages you went through as you became expert. Soon that experience of becoming disappears from view, however tough you found it at the time. But it's that very experience that's so important and so worthwhile. Becoming expert is about channelling our energies into something that has purpose and meaning. It's about making use of the potential we all have, to achieve something that goes beyond humdrum everyday life.

Becoming an expert of this kind involves a shift in who you are, not just in how much you know and what you can do. In this book, I distinguish between the knowing that focuses on process – the skills and procedural knowledge of a plumber, a tailor or a surgeon – and the transformations that go on underneath. Becoming expert is about your relationship with your work and the people you do it for and with. It allows you to work with thin materials on the verge of collapse, to judge when to act and when to hold back, to let someone else go ahead and make mistakes because you know they have to learn.

I believe that we all have the capacity to become expert, whether we recognize it or not. Of course, not everyone can become an international concert pianist, a surgical pioneer, a famous sculptor or a Nobel Prize–winning scientist. Most people wouldn't want to – becoming a Nobel Prize–winning scientist is to live your whole life for science. But we're all on a path, we all do things we care about, and we can all get better at doing them. The ideas in this book will resonate with anyone who joins a basketball club, gives presentations to colleagues at work, learns a foreign language, goes to a pottery class or designs spreadsheets. Becoming expert is about recognizing our potential and letting it grow. Like a deep ocean current, becoming expert may not be visible on the surface, but its effects are profound.

While it's clear that we need experts, we often think of them as a species apart. We overlook the fact that we can all become expert ourselves, or at least move in that direction. Though the taxidermists, tailors and magicians in this book might seem exotic, we can all aspire to do what they do, though to a different extent and in our own area of interest. But we often fail to see the parallels between what such experts have gone through and what we are experiencing ourselves. We don't recognize them as examples of what we can become.

All the experts in this book have something in common: what they do is central to who they are. This doesn't mean that becoming expert is restricted to your main occupation. Your passion may be dismissively described by others as a ‘hobby'. But many people are more expert at their hobby than their ‘proper' job.

Becoming expert does not depend on how society gauges the value of your work, for society is fickle and inconstant. And it's not about fame or money either. Instead, it's about the path you take. If you are going through the stages in this book, as I believe we all are, you are on your way to becoming expert, whether you're a plumber, a pilot or a Sunday painter.

I've tried to give a realistic sense of what this path is like. It's not a steady climb upwards; it's more like a difficult mountain pass. You might have to descend to get around some obstacle before you can continue. You'll go through bleak times when you feel you're standing still or going backwards. It takes belief and perseverance to stick with it, to realize that the path is going upwards overall. Becoming expert takes time – lots of time.

I hope this book has helped to counter the argument that you can do everything in a rush. I am aware that there are courses on the internet that claim to teach you to speak a language, play a musical instrument or become an investment banker in just one month. But these short, snipped-up experiences aren't satisfying alternatives to a long-term commitment. You can't master the guitar in a month, because there isn't an end point to mastering the guitar. You can start, but you never finish. That's the fascination of becoming expert.

Even in a fast-moving society like ours, some things remain constant. We need experts to move us around the world, treat us when we're sick, fix things when they go wrong, create beauty and inspire us. The specifics do change, of course. Things that were taken for granted become obsolete. For the most part we no longer develop photographs in darkrooms, use manual typewriters or send telegrams, so we no longer need experts in those areas. Now we have different approaches to creating images, communicating at distance and writing text. Soon, these too will change. Yet the developments of the future will require experts as much as the past ever did – more so, as the complexity of our world increases. Robotics, artificial intelligence, new forms of energy, the responsible stewardship of resources – all these will depend on experts. And those experts of the future must apply themselves to their craft with the same sense of purpose as Derek the taxidermist, Andrew the wood engraver and Joshua the tailor do today. Although their fields may be very different, the process will remain the same.

我们都需要理查德这样的专家，因为我们依赖他们的工作。当我们遇到问题的时候，我们需要专家来解决问题。我们生病时，需要医生。我们乘飞机时，需要飞行员。我们的地下室有问题，就需要专家来处理潮湿的问题。然而，现在有关专家的论调常常让我生气。在最后一章里，我会解释为什么。

我经常听说有人认为专家无关紧要 —— 他们在瞬息万变的世界里不再有价值了。我听说专家被认为是无用的精英。然而事实远非如此。在生病时、乘飞机时、屋子受潮时，我们都会意识到这一点。

然而专家提供的服务只是他们重要性的一部分。成为专家是做人的核心。我们最终是否成为专家，是否能得到同行和更广阔的世界的认可，这并不重要 —— 重要的是，无论我们努力实现什么目标，我们都要精益求精。不管我们的兴趣是什么，花上多年时间去做一些有价值的事情，能够满足我们的一种深层需求：让自己沉浸在比自身更伟大的事情里。

在本书中，我记录了成为专家的内在过程。比起「专长」的陈述性知识或者子技能，很少有人写到这些内在过程。这在一定程度上是因为知识和技能更容易被展示和测试。然而，这也是因为，专业人士很容易忘记自己在成为专家的过程中经历的阶段。不管当时有多艰难，那种「成为」专家的过程很快就会消失在视野中。但是这种经历却无比重要，弥足珍贵。成为专家就是要把我们的精力输送到有目的、有意义的事情上；就是要发挥我们所有人都有的潜能，做出一些超越平凡人的日常生活的事情。

成为这样的专家，需要你改变自己，这种改变不仅在于你有多少知识，能做什么事情。在本书中，我区分了专注于过程的知识（管道工、裁缝或外科医生的技能和程序性知识）与内在的转变。成为专家涉及你与自己的工作、你工作的受众及所接触的人之间的关系。成为专家让你能够处理濒临崩溃的脆弱工作对象，判断什么时候应该行动；什么时候应该克制自己，允许别人放手做事、犯错，因为你知道他们必须吸取教训。

我相信我们都有能力成为专家，不管我们承认与否。当然，不是每个人都会成为在全球演出的钢琴家、外科的先驱者、著名雕塑家或者获得诺贝尔奖的科学家。大多数不想成为这样的人 —— 做一个诺贝尔奖得主，就要把一生奉献给科学。但是我们都走在同一条路上，都在做我们关心的事情，而且我们都可以做得更好。对于任何加入篮球俱乐部、给同事做报告、学习外语、参加陶艺班或制作电子表格的人来说，他们都能与本书中的观念产生共鸣。成为专家就是要认识到自己的潜能，并让它成长壮大。就像深海洋流一样，成为专家可能不会表现在外表上，但这个过程的影响是深远的。

虽然很明显我们需要专家，但我们经常认为他们与我们完全不同。我们忽略了这样一个事实：我们每个人都可以成为专家，或至少朝这个方向前进。虽然书中的标本剥制师、裁缝和魔术师看起来有些不同寻常，但我们都可以在自己感兴趣的领域，力求做到他们所做到的事情 —— 尽管我们达到的造诣深浅不同。然而我们往往看不到这些专家的经历与我们自身的体验有何相似之处。我们不认为他们是我们可以成为的榜样。

本书中的所有专家都有一个共同点：他们所做的事情对于他们的身份来说至关重要。这不意味着你只能在自己的主要工作领域里成为专家。你所热爱的东西可能会被别人不屑地称为一种「爱好」，但许多人在爱好上比在工作上更专业。

成为专家并不取决于社会如何衡量你工作的价值，因为社会是变幻无常的。这也不是名誉或金钱的问题。相反，重要的是你选择的道路。如果你正在经历本书中写的这些阶段（我相信我们都是如此），那么你就在成为专家，无论你是管道工、飞行员还是业余画家。

我已经尝试让大家对这条道路产生一种真实的感觉。这不是一个稳步上升的过程，更像是一条艰难的山路。你可能要向下走一段路，绕开一些障碍，然后才能继续向上。当你觉得自己停滞不前或倒退的时候，你会经历惨淡的时期。坚持下去需要信念与毅力，你要意识到这条路的大方向是向上的。成为专家需要时间 —— 许多时间。

我希望这本书有助于反驳这种观点：所有事都可以一蹴而就。我知道，网上有些课程声称能在一个月内教会你说一门语言、弹奏一种乐器或成为一名投资银行家，但这些短暂、浅尝辄止的经历不能代替长期的投入。你不可能在一个月内掌握吉他，因为掌握没有终点。你可以开始，但你永远不会走到终点。

这就是成为专家的魅力所在。

即使在我们这样一个快速变化的社会里，有些东西仍然是不变的。我们需要专家带我们去世界各地，在我们生病时治疗我们，在我们出错时解决问题，创造美好的事物并激励我们。

当然，具体的事物会发生变化。我们认为理所应当的事物会过时。在今天的大部分情况下，我们不再在暗房里冲洗照片，不再用手动打字机，不再发电报，所以我们不再需要这些领域的专家了。现在我们有不同的方式生成图像、远距离交流、书写文本。很快，这些也会改变。然而，未来的发展会像过去一样需要专家 —— 随着世界越来越错综复杂，情况更是如此。机器人、人工智能、新能源、资源的负责任管理 —— 所有这些都将依赖于专家。这些专家必须像今天的标本剥制师德里克、木版雕刻师安德鲁和裁缝约书亚一样，怀着同样的使命感专注于自己的技艺。尽管他们的领域可能大不相同，但这个过程会保持不变。

### 12.2 毒素与养分

Toxins and nutrients

The opportunity to become expert should be one of our inalienable rights. It's how we fulfil our potential as human beings. Yet the slow process required is at odds with demands for instant gratification. There's a growing sense that anyone can learn to do anything – and quickly. But that's not the case. Becoming expert involves sticking at something for much longer than you normally would. Of course, just persevering doesn't automatically turn you into an expert, and there are plenty of people who keep doing the same thing and don't get much better – like me with my juggling.

Like any organic process, becoming expert needs nutrients. These include guidance and encouragement, exposure to mistakes, opportunities for spending time with your materials and the people you work with, and allowing your personality to unfold. I've described this path as if you started when you become an Apprentice. I've told the stories of people in specialized fields where it can seem that their careers only began when they joined their workshop, studio or salon. But there is always a background. Throughout our childhood we are immersed in a world of the senses, experiencing the world and the people around us. At home and at school, we stock our internal library of sensations, knowledge and skills which we build on later. We need to experience what it is to look, hear, touch, sniff and taste; to work with other people; to share space and to negotiate our wishes around theirs. Becoming expert is part of a story which begins when we are born.

Yet in many parts of the world, including the United Kingdom, conditions for becoming expert are under threat. These threats include a relentless pressure to speed everything up, a narrowing of school curriculums, and a neoliberal mindset that sees everything in terms of the bottom line and places short-term profit over long-term value. More pressure comes from reduced social contact and dwindling opportunities for engaging physically with the material world. Paradoxically, as we are becoming more connected globally, local isolation is getting worse. Opportunities for shared doing are becoming scarcer.

Concentration and focus are being nibbled away at by the demands of email and social media. The urgent takes precedence over the important, and pressures for an immediate response can be overwhelming. Gradual processes are under attack, whether in food, reading or craftsmanship. Slow learning is being squeezed by political pressure to achieve qualifications faster, with less effort and fewer resources. Qualifications themselves are skewed by an obsession with assessment. But quantifying what students learn at the expense of how they learn it is dangerously short-sighted.

Young people are being deprived of the opportunities they need to make the most of their potential. When newcomers start in an expert field, we expect them to have basic skills of reading, writing, arithmetic and using a computer, to have an understanding of the world around them. We expect a basic fluency in the physical world, an understanding that is built through years of exposure at home and at school. We expect people to relate to others they work alongside, to behave responsibly and to look out for one another's safety. If we can no longer take that fluency for granted, we must do something to redress it, or make allowances for the time it will take to build up later. We know the conditions that becoming expert requires, yet we are allowing them to be destroyed.

I've noticed this at the university where I work. Until recently, you could assume that first-year students would arrive with a range of basic skills they'd learned at home and school through working with their hands. Cutting with scissors and paper, sticking things together with glue, writing with a pen, tying knots in shoelaces and string – all skills which should develop throughout childhood. Some people are more dextrous or confident than others, of course, but there was a baseline you could rely on, a shared experience of having done stuff. Young people had also learned to do things in front of others, through music, drama and dance. Even if they weren't good performers in a conventional sense, they had gained vital experience.

In recent years, my colleagues and I have found that we can no longer make these assumptions. Young people entering science and medicine at our university have excellent academic results, but many struggle to tie a firm knot, cut out a shape with scissors, or speak in front of other people. Though a glance at the UK state secondary school curriculum gives a clue as to why this is, my students come from all over the world, which makes me think the problem is global.

Art, design, music, dance, cooking and other subjects that involve dexterity and performance are being eradicated from the curriculum. Even science subjects are taught in an abstracted way, with few opportunities to work in a laboratory and carry out experiments for yourself. Pupils in science lessons have their chemicals measured out for them in advance, to save teachers' time and make sure that the practicals ‘work'. Opportunities for error are being eliminated by an institutional aversion to risk. Young people no longer experience what it feels like to get things wrong and have to put them right.

There is also a pernicious tendency to divide and categorize our lives. ‘Doing' is relegated to the art room, yet art rooms are being abolished. Performance is confined to music or drama, yet music and drama are being cut out. This is a tragedy and a disgrace. We are stripping people of their birthright – their confidence to work with the material world around them. Talking to a head teacher at a north London school, I was horrified to learn that some pupils are unable to hold a pen or use a pair of scissors because they have never had the opportunity to try. This is not for lack of will on the part of the school. Quite the opposite. It comes from a combination of decades of inadequate resourcing and a lack of insight into how people become expert. This is not just a problem for young people coming into the system now. It's a problem for us all.

The push for quick results is having an especially baneful effect. A preoccupation with visual, screen-based information is making the problem more evident. Young people learn about chemistry experiments by watching scientists online, not by doing the work themselves. The sounds and smells of science are being sanitized. People are becoming spectators, not participants. Sensory richness is being flattened by technologies which privilege sight over the other senses.

As you'll have seen so far, I'm all in favour of technology. I'm writing this book on a laptop computer. I have worked throughout my career with people who operate at the cutting edge of technological innovation, and I am excited that each new generation will be expert in things that I can't yet conceive of. My point is that we should use technological advances and social change to enrich our experiences, not impoverish them.

We are in a perilous place at the moment. We risk losing skills without even noticing that they're disappearing, like habitat loss elsewhere in the world. The statistics are alarming. In the United Kingdom, school exam entries in creative subjects have fallen by over 20 per cent since 2010, and entries in design and technology have fallen by 57 per cent. The skills of doing are being wrenched out of curriculums. There is an insidious assumption that science is more productive than the arts, and that there is no place for art within science. This is short-sighted to the point of madness.

Myopic initiatives to ‘streamline' systems which have evolved over many years are hollowing out the expertise of communities. That mixture of ‘newcomers and old-timers', as Lave and Wenger put it, is disappearing. Becoming expert is seen as individual, not collective. Yet all the stories in this book show how much we depend on one another, on communities of practice, as we move along our own path to becoming expert.

This is not a nostalgic yearning for an imaginary golden age. There are plenty of bad things about the old-fashioned apprenticeship system. It encouraged bullying and exploitation. It expected inhuman levels of work. It put a system ahead of those within it. Often, it stultified initiative and prevented people from realizing their potential, keeping them in dead-end roles long after they should have progressed, or not allowing them to participate at all.

It's not all doom and gloom, however. Domains of practice may come and go, but reports of the death of experts have been much exaggerated. Becoming expert remains a basic human need, and the opportunity to pursue that path should be there for every one of us. The threats are real, but they can be countered. The people in this book are living proof of that. They exemplify the principles I've outlined: paying close attention for a long time to something worthwhile that requires and repays sustained commitment; subordinating your desires to the needs of other people; and becoming as good as you can be, even if your area of interest falls outside the mainstream.

As I said earlier, the ecosystem of expertise depends on nutrients which we have a responsibility to deliver. These nutrients include a supportive environment, having basic material needs provided for, and becoming part of a group of like-minded people. A nutrient-rich environment should provide opportunities to gain physical skill, factual knowledge and a sensitivity to materials and people.

Perhaps the biggest threat of all is impatience. We are losing sight of the need for slow learning. Learners need time and support. Experts only emerge through a long process of growth and maturation, like trees growing in a forest. Like trees, experts need to develop without being uprooted and transplanted. Uprooting and transplanting wastes energy on new rooting that would be far better spent on growing upwards.

When it happens as it should, travelling the path to becoming expert is like a personal relationship. It has the potential to sustain and enrich. It offers great satisfaction and invites lifelong contribution in return. Like other long-term relationships, it doesn't have a clear-cut end. Large enough and flexible enough to contain your growth and evolution, it grows and evolves with you.

成为专家的机会应当是我们不可剥夺的权利之一。这样我们才能发挥我们生而为人的潜能。然而，这种缓慢的过程与即时满足的需求是格格不入的。越来越多的人认为，任何人可以学做任何事 —— 而且很快就能学会，但事实并非如此。要成为专家，就需要在一件事上投入远比平常更多的时间。当然，仅靠坚持不懈不会自动让你成为专家，很多人一直在做同样的事情，但并没有进步 —— 就像我学杂耍一样。

就像任何有机的过程一样，成为专家需要养分。这包括指导和鼓励，犯错，花时间与你的工作对象、工作时接触的人在一起，允许自己的个性逐渐展现出来。我已经讲述过你成为学徒、走上这条路时的情形。我也讲过一些专业领域里的人的故事，他们的职业生涯似乎是在进入他们的工坊、工作室或美发店后才开始的。但是大背景无处不在。整个童年，我们一直沉浸在感官的世界里，体验着世界和周围的人。无论是在家还是在学校，我们都在内在的信息库里积累大量感觉、知识和技能，我们日后会在这个基础上不断发展进步。我们需要体验视觉、听觉、触觉、嗅觉和味觉；需要和其他人一起工作；需要与他人共处一个空间，在自我和他人的意愿之间找到平衡。成为专家是我们人生故事的一部分，这个故事从我们出生时就开始了。

然而，在世界上的许多地方，包括英国在内，成为专家的条件受到了威胁。这些威胁包括使一切加速的无情压力、学校课程的缩减，以及从成本、收益的角度看待一切、将短期利益置于长远价值之上的新自由主义思维。更多的压力来自社会接触的减少，亲身接触物质世界的机会的减少。矛盾的是，随着我们在全球范围内的联系越来越紧密，地区的孤立却越发严重。共同工作的机会越来越少了。

注意力和专注力正在被电子邮件和社交媒体蚕食。紧急的事情优先于重要的事情，立即做出反应的压力可能会让人不堪重负。无论是在美食、阅读还是手工艺方面，循序渐进的过程都受到了冲击。缓慢的学习过程受到了环境压力的打压 —— 这种压力要求学生用更少的努力和资源，更快地获取资质。对于评估的痴迷已经扭曲了资质本身。但是，以牺牲学习质量的代价来量化学生的学习内容，是一种危险的短视。

年轻人失去了充分发挥自身潜能所需要的机会。新人进入一个专业领域的时候，我们希望他们具备阅读、写作、算术和使用电脑的基本技能，了解周围的世界。我们希望他们对物质世界有基本的了解，这种了解是通过多年在家、在学校的经历建立起来的。我们希望他们能与工作中的他人建立良好的关系，为自己的行为负责，照看彼此的安全。如果我们不再把具备这些基本能力看作理所应当，我们就必须做些事情来纠正这一点，或者为这些能力的培养预留出一些时间。我们知道成为专家所需要的条件，但我们却放任这些条件受到破坏。

我在大学工作时就发现了这一点。直到最近，你可能还以为，一年级学生在入学时，应当掌握一系列他们在家和在学校里通过动手学习到的基本技能。用剪刀剪纸、用胶水粘东西、用笔写字、系鞋带、给绳子打结 —— 所有这些技能都应该是在童年期培养的。当然，有些人比其他人更手巧、更自信，但学生群体本应该有一个基础的水平，一种做过这些事情的共同经历。年轻人还应该通过音乐、戏剧和舞蹈学会在别人面前做事。

即使他们不是传统意义上的优秀表演者，但他们也会因此获得重要的经验。

近年来，同事和我发现，我们不能再如此想当然了。在我们的大学里，进入理学和医学领域的年轻人成绩优异，但许多人连打绳结、用剪刀剪裁图形、在他人面前讲话都会遇到困难。虽然看一眼英国公立中学的课程就知道这是为什么，但我的学生来自世界各地，所以我认为这是一个全球性的问题。

艺术、设计、音乐、舞蹈、烹饪，以及其他涉及技巧与表演的学科都从课程表里消失了。甚至连科学的学科也在以抽象的方式讲授，学生很少有机会在实验室里学习，凭自己的兴趣做实验。在科学课程上，为了节省老师的时间，确保实际操作「正确无误」，学生要用的化学物质都已经为他们称好了。由于我们的制度厌恶风险，犯错的机会正在消失。年轻人不会再体验到犯错、必须纠正错误的感觉。

我们还有一种将生活分门别类的有害倾向。「动手」被归为艺术教室里的事情，而艺术教室正在被废除。表演则仅限于音乐或戏剧，而音乐和戏剧课则正在被削减。这是一场悲剧和耻辱。我们正在剥夺学生与生俱来的权利 —— 他们与周围的物质世界打交道的信心。在与伦敦北部一所学校的校长交流时，我大吃一惊：有些学生不会握笔，或者不会使用剪刀，因为他们从没有尝试的机会。这不是因为学校缺乏意愿。恰恰相反。这是由于他们几十年来的资源不足，以及不了解人是如何成为专家的。这不仅仅是年轻人进入社会面临的问题。这是我们所有人的问题。

这种快速追求成果的做法，产生了极为有害的影响。视觉的、电子设备屏幕上的信息占据了人的大部分注意力，因此这个问题变得更加明显。年轻人通过在线观看科学家的实验来学习化学实验，而不是自己动手做实验。科学的声音和气味正在消失。大家成了旁观者，而不是参与者。丰富的感觉信息被重视视觉、忽视其他感觉的技术所消除了。

如你所见，我完全支持技术进步。我正在笔记本电脑上写作本书。在我的职业生涯里，我一直在与那些在技术创新前沿工作的人合作，每一代年轻人都将在我无法想象的事情上成为专家，这让我感到很兴奋。我想说的是，我们应该利用技术进步和社会变革来丰富我们的体验，而不是让体验变得贫乏。

我们正处于一个危险的境地。我们可能会失去许多技能，却没有意识到它们正在消失，就像世界其他地方的生物栖息地逐渐消失一样。相关的统计数据让人担忧。在英国，自 2010 年起，创意类学科的入学考试参加人数下降了 20％以上，设计类和技术类专业的入学人数下降了 57％。动手技能的教学正在从课程设置中消失。有一种隐秘而危险的假设认为，科学比艺术更有价值，科学中没有艺术的一席之地。这种目光已经短浅到了疯狂的程度。

这种「精简」的弊政经过多年的发展，已经掏空了实践社群的专业精神。如莱夫和温格所说的「新人与老手的交流」正在迅速消失。成为专家被看作是个人的事情，而不需要集体的力量。然而，本书中的所有故事都表明，在我们成为专家的路上，我们多么依赖彼此，依赖实践社群。

这不是一种对假想的黄金时代的怀旧渴望。传统的学徒制有很多不好的地方。那种制度鼓励霸凌与剥削，要求不人道的工作量；它将一套规则摆在处于这种制度下的人的面前。这种学徒制往往会抑制人的主动性，妨碍他们发挥自己的潜能，让他们在本应取得进步的很长一段时间后，依然困在毫无意义的工作里，或者根本不允许他们参与到工作中来。

然而，现实情况可能不全是糟糕的。不同的实践领域可能出现又消失，但「专家已死」的说法实在有些夸张。成为专家依然是人类的基本需求，在这条道路上探索的机会应该为我们每个人所有。这些威胁都是真实存在的，但它们是可以被应对的。本书中的这些人就是活生生的例子。他们践行了我概述的原则：长期专注于有价值的事情 —— 这些事情需要持续的投入，而这种投入能带来奖赏；让自己的欲求从属于他人的需要；即使自己的领域不在主流之内，也要精益求精。

我之前说过，专长的生态系统依赖于我们有责任提供的养分。这些养分包括提供支持性的环境，满足基本的物质需求，成为志同道合的群体中的一员。一个给养丰富的环境应该提供机会，让人获得身体技能、事实性知识，以及对待工作对象和他人的敏感性。

也许最大的威胁就是缺乏耐心。我们正在忽视缓慢学习的必要性。学习者需要时间和支持。专家必须经过漫长的成长和成熟过程，就像树木在森林中成长一样。就像树木一样，专家需要发展，而不是被连根拔起、移植。拔起和移植浪费了重新生根的能量，而这些能量本可以更好地用于向上生长。

当成为专家的过程恰如其分地发生时，它就像一种人与人的关系。它具有经久不衰和丰富充盈的潜力。它能为人提供极大的满足感，让人为之奉献终生。就像其他的长期关系一样，这个过程没有明确的终点。这个过程足够宏大、足够灵活，能容纳你的成长和进化，它也会随着你一起成长和进化。

### 12.3 终点？

The end?

So what is being expert? How do you know when you've become one? The truth is, you never really get there. The path to becoming expert doesn't have an end. So I'll finish with some thoughts about writing this book, using it as a mirror for the ideas it contains.

This is the first book I've written on my own, so I'm not an expert author. Yet it's not the first time I've written anything, so it's a point along my path to becoming expert. That process started at primary school, when I learned the letters of the alphabet and put them together to make simple words. Over the years I've done a lot of writing, from student exams and GP referral letters to essays and scientific papers. But it wasn't until I started writing this book that these stages I've gone through became coherent.

As I was doing time with all that writing, I was using my senses, responding to what other people had written, and sharpening my ideas about what worked and what didn't. I developed a feel for the kind of writer I wanted to become. I got a sense of thin materials on the verge of collapse, of how much I could squeeze a sentence before it lost its meaning or how far I could stretch it before it snapped. I tried things out, got them wrong and had to put them right.

At first my focus was on myself and how I wanted to say things. But then I had to make the transition ‘from you to them'. I had to shift from what I wanted to write to what other people would find interesting to read. I had to think how my work would land. I began to develop my voice, my style, my individuality. Now I'm working on how to combine all that to express ideas I've been struggling to articulate for decades, and how to move my field in a different direction.

For each step forward there have been two steps back. I've had to improvise, to respond to the contexts I work in and the people I meet. I've kept reframing my ideas and thinking of new ways to express them. But now I have to stop. I know this book will never be as good as it could be. But sooner or later you need to perform what you've been practising, share it with other people and move on. Echoing Paul Valéry the poet, my editor put it like this: you never finish a book; you just decide when to abandon it.

For me, that sense of never quite being finished lies at the heart of becoming expert. It's an unending process with an elusive goal, but it meets a need in all of us. It's what Andrew Davidson in Chapter 4 meant when he said, ‘For more than forty years I've been trying to make the perfect print from a woodblock. I never have, and I know I never will. But I'll never stop trying.' It's what Joshua Byrne meant when he said that he knows there's no such thing as a perfect suit, but he'll always keep trying to make one. It's what I feel about being a doctor, too. There's no perfect operation and no perfect consultation. But we should never stop trying. It's what the path to becoming expert is all about.

成为专家意味着什么？你怎么知道自己什么时候成了专家？事实上，你永远不会真的达成这个目标。成为专家的道路没有终点。因此，我将以一些写作本书时想到的东西作为结尾，将这些想法当作一面镜子，反映本书中所包含的思想。

这是我独立写作的第一本书，所以我不是一个专家级的作者。但这不是我第一次写东西，所以这是我在成为专家之路上的一站。这一过程始于小学，那时我学会了字母表，并把字母组合起来，构成简单的单词。多年以来，我写了许多东西，从学生时代的考试到全科医生的转诊信，再到文章和科研论文。

但是，直到我开始写作本书的时候，我经历的所有这些阶段才变成了一个连贯的整体。

在我为写作积累经验的时候，我运用了自己的感官，品鉴了其他人所写的东西，对哪些文字好、哪些不好有了清晰的想法。对于自己想成为哪种作者，我产生了一种感觉。我曾感受过脆弱的工作对象处于崩溃边缘的感觉，我了解了我能在一个句子失去意义之前将其缩减到什么程度，以及它在变味儿之前能延长到什么长度。我尝试过，犯过错，也曾不得不改正。

一开始，我关注的只有我自己和我想说的话，但我后来不得不做出「从你到他们」的转变。我必须从写自己想写的东西，转变到写他人愿意读的东西。我必须考虑别人对我的作品有何感受。我逐渐找到了自己的「声音」、风格、个性。现在，我在努力把所有这些结合起来，表达我几十年来一直想表达的想法，思考如何带领我的领域走向一个不同的方向。

我每前进一步，就会倒退两步。我必须随机应变，对我工作的环境和遇见的人做出反应。我不断地整理自己的想法，思考新的表达方式。但现在我必须停下来。我知道这本书永远达不到理想的水平。你迟早都要把你一直在练习的东西拿出来表演，与他人分享，然后继续前进。我的编辑说了一句话，与诗人保罗·瓦莱里（Paul Valéry）的话有异曲同工之妙：你永远写不完一本书，你只需要决定在什么时候放下它。

对我来说，那种永远无法完成的感觉就是成为专家的核心。这是一个永无止境的过程，其目标是难以捉摸的，但它满足了我们所有人都有的一种需求。安德鲁·戴维森在第 4 章所说的那句话就表达了这个意思：「40 多年来，我一直在尝试用木板制作出完美的版画。我从来没做到过，我知道我永远也做不到，但我决不会停止努力。」约书亚·伯恩说他知道没有完美的西装，但他会一直努力去做。他表达的也是这个意思。这也是我做医生的感觉。没有完美的手术，也没有完美的问诊，但是我们不应停止尝试。这就是成为专家之路的重中之重。
