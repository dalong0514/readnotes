### 0101. 主题卡 —— 结构决定性质

This chapter begins your training toward understanding the relationship between structure and properties by reviewing the fundamentals of the Lewis approach to molecular structure and bonding and describes the various graphical ways molecular structures are presented. Principles of acid–base chemistry — emphasized in a quantitative way in introductory chemistry courses — are revisited qualitatively as a tool for introducing the effect of structure on properties. This structure/property relationship is what makes organic chemistry important. The same atom (carbon) is common to many structural types, countless compounds with different properties, and much variation in the degree to which a particular property is expressed. What is equally remarkable is the degree to which a relatively small group of principles suffice to connect the structure of a substance to its properties.

### 0601. 数据信息卡 —— 演化的关键时间节点

An emerging field of study called「Big History」is nothing if not ambitious. It could also be called「The History of Everything」and covers the period from when the universe was formed in a「Big Bang」13 billion years ago until the present. During the first few seconds of time, protons and electrons combined to give hydrogen and helium atoms. Then, some 4.7 billion years ago, local gravitational forces caused the region of the universe around a particular star to assume that unique feature we call our solar system. Earth was located at the proper distance from the sun to allow the spontaneous formation of molecules, assemblies of molecules, replication of molecular assemblies, and so on. The earliest living things appeared about 4 billion years ago, the earliest ape-like animals 10 million years ago, and modern humans less than 100,000 years ago.

### 0701. 任意卡 —— 物理、化学、生物的关系

A Neanderthal looking at the lights in the night sky, for example, is not science. But it can lead to science — an organized body of knowledge based on theory and experiment. Astronomy is regarded as the oldest science but was limited to studying the night sky until the telescope was invented in 1608 and pointed skyward by Galileo a year later. Chemists, however, like to call their own discipline「The Central Science」because of its relationship to physics on one side and biology on the other. In the same way, among the various subdisciplines of chemistry, organic chemistry can be said to be central. It adapts the physical principles that underlie the content of general chemistry courses to the relationships between structure and properties of compounds based on carbon — the most versatile of all the elements.
