## 0101. A Network Point of View on the World

Networks are present in the everyday life of many people. On a typical day, we check emails, update social network profiles, make mobile phone calls, use public transportation, take planes, transfer money and goods, or start new personal and professional relations…In all these cases — consciously or not — we are using networks and their properties. Similarly, networks appear in important global phenomena. Financial crises generate domino effects in the web of connections between banks and companies. Pandemics — like avian flu, SARS, or swine flu — spread in the airport network. Climate change can alter the network of relations between species in ecosystems. Terrorism and war target the infrastructure grids of a country. Large-scale blackouts take place in power grids. Computer viruses diffuse in the Internet. Governments and companies can track people’s identity through their social networks and other digital communication tools. Finally, the various applications of genetics depend on the knowledge of the genetic regulatory networks that operate within the cell.

In all these situations we deal with a large set of different elements (individuals, companies, airports, species, power stations, computers, genes …), connected through a disordered pattern of many different interactions: that is, they all have an underlying network structure. Often, this hidden network is the key to understanding those situations. 

A good example is the collapse of cod population in the north-western Atlantic in the eighties. At the time, the shortage of cod generated a massive economic crisis in the Canadian fishery industry. Canadian stakeholders asked for more expeditions to hunt seals, maintaining that controlling these predators of cod would help stop the collapse. Many seals were killed during the nineties, but the cod population did not recover. In the meantime, ecologists studied the different food chains that connected cod and seals. By the end of the decade, they drew a complete map (Figure 1) where a lot of different chains were fou give rise to of the are notnd to connect the two species. In the light of this intricate picture, hunting for predators of cod does not necessarily help the fish. For example, seals predate about 150 species, and several of them are predators of cod: thus, reducing the population of seals can end up increasing the pressure of other predators on cod.

Ecosystems are complex webs of species: it is crucial to take into account this underlying network structure if we want to understand and manage them. Similar caution must be taken with several other systems, all based on a networked architecture. For example, the development of an infectious disease like AIDS is strongly influenced by the pattern of nonprotected sexual relations within a population. Similarly, liquidity shocks depend on the interwoven network of money exchange between banks.

All the examples above are instances of the so-called emergent phenomena. That is some collective behaviour that cannot be predicted by looking at the single elements forming the system. Usually, systems that display these phenomena are dubbed complex systems. For example, a single ant is a relatively awkward animal, but many ants together are capable of activities as complex as building large anthills or storing large quantities of food. In human societies, social order arises from the combination of autonomous individuals, often with conflicting interests, that still end up performing tasks that nobody could do on their own. Similarly, a living organism arises from the interaction of its parts; and the extraordinary resilience of the Internet to errors, attacks, and traffic peaks is a performance of the network as a whole rather than the result of the action of individual machines.

Networks, with their emphasis on the interactions, are the key to understanding many of these phenomena. Imagine two football teams whose players have very similar skills, and yet the two teams perform very differently: probably this difference depends on how good or bad the interactions are between the players on the pitch. Similarly, a single player can be good in his league team and bad in his national team because of the different positions he has with respect to the other players in the two groups. The performance of a team is a kind of emergent phenomenon, one that does depends not only on the quality of the single players or on the sum of their individual skills, but also on the network of interactions between them. Many emergent phenomena rely crucially on the structure of the underlying networks.

从网络的观点看世界

The network approach focuses all the attention on the global structure of the interactions within a system. The detailed properties of each element on its own are simply ignored. Consequently, systems as different as a computer network, an ecosystem, or a social group are all described by the same tool: a graph, that is, a bare architecture of nodes bounded by connections. This approach was originally developed in mathematics by Leonard Euler and later spread to a wide range of disciplines, including sociology, which has deployed it widely, and more recently physics, engineering, computer science, biology, and many others.

Representing widely different systems with the same tool can only be done by a high level of abstraction. What is lost in the specific description of the details is gained in the form of universality  — that is, thinking about very different systems as if they were different realizations of the same theoretical structure. In this respect, the spread of a computer virus can be similar to flu; hacking a router can have the same effect as the extinction of a species in an ecosystem; and the growth of the World Wide Web (WWW) can be set alongside the increase in scientific literature.

This line of reasoning provides many insights. For instance, representing a system as a graph allows us to perceive large-scale structures that encompass apparently unrelated elements. In 2003, a trivial accident in the Swiss electric grid triggered a large-scale blackout affecting Sicily, 1,000 kilometres away. Focusing on the network structure allows us to see that faraway elements end up being strongly connected, through incredibly short paths of relation or communication. The current observation that two individuals geographically and socially apart — such as a rainforest inhabitant and a manager in the City of London — are connected by only「six degrees of separation」is not far from reality, and it can be explained in terms of the network structure of social relations.

The network approach also sheds light on another important feature: the fact that certain systems that grow without external control are still capable of spontaneously developing an internal order. Cells or ecosystems are not「designed」but nevertheless work in a robust way. Similarly, social groups and trends arise from an immense variety of different pressures and motivations but still display clear and definite shapes. The Internet and the WWW boomed without the presence of any regulating authority and were promoted by an enormous variety of unrelated agents: however, they usually work in a coherent and efficient way. All these are self-organized processes, i.e. phenomena in which order and organization are not the result of an external intervention or global blueprint but the outcome of local mechanisms or tendencies, iterated along thousands of interactions. Network models are able to describe in a clear and natural way how self-organization arises in many systems. As well, networks allow us to better understand dynamical processes such as the rapid spread of computer viruses, the large scale of pandemics, the sudden collapse of infrastructures, and the bursts of social phobias or music trends.

In the study of complex, emergent, and self-organized systems (the modern science of complexity), networks are becoming increasingly important as a universal mathematical framework, especially when massive amounts of data are involved. This is typically the case of individuals accumulating queries in search engines, updates in social websites.

从网络的观点看世界

网络存在于许多人的日常生活之中。通常的一天里，我们都会查收电子邮件，更新社交网络上的个人资料，打移动电话，使用公共交通工具，乘坐飞机，转移货币和货物，或者开始新的私人和业务关系等等。我们在所有这些情况中 一一 有意或无意地 一一 都会涉及网络及其特性。同样地，网络也会出现在重要的全球现象中。金融危机会在银行和公司的联系网络中产生多米诺效应。流行病，比如禽流感、非典型肺炎或者猪流感，则在机场网络之间蔓延。气候化能够改变生态系統内部不同物种之间的关系网络，恐怖主义和战争则瞄准了一国之中的基础设施网络。电网内会发生大规模停电，计算机病毒在互联网中传播，政府和企业则会通过人们的社交网络和其他数字通信工具来追踪他们的身份信息。最后，遗传学的各种应用取決于人们对在细胞内部起作用的基因调控网络知识的掌握。

在所有这些情況中，我们都会处理大量不同元素（个人、公司、机场、物种、发电站、计算机、基因......）的集合，它们通过无序的多种相互作用模式而彼此关联，即它们都有着某种潜在的网络结构。通常，这种隐含的网络结构是理解前述重要现象的 1 关键所在。其中ー个很好的例子便是上世纪 80 年代大西洋西北海域鳕鱼种群的衰竭。当时，鳕鱼的短缺给加拿大水产业造成了巨大的经済危机。加拿大境内的利益相关者吁求更多地猎捕海豹，他们认为控制鳕鱼捕食者的数量有助于阻止鳕鱼种群的衰竭。大量的海豹在上世纪 90 年代遭到猎杀，但鳕鱼种群并未恢复。与此同时，生态学家们则对关联鳕鱼和海豹的不同食物链进行了研究。到上世纪 90 年代末期，他们已经为研究发现的关联这两个物种的大量不同食物链条绘制了一幅详尽的网络图（图 1）。根据这个复杂的网络图，捕杀鳕鱼捕食者并不必然有助于鳕鱼种群的恢复。比如，海豹捕食大约 150 种猎物，其中也包括鳕鱼的其他捕食者。因此海豹种群数量的减少便增加了其他鳕鱼捕食者对其种群数量所造成的压力。

生态系统乃复杂的物种网络：如果我们想要理解并管理这些物种，将这种底层的网络结构纳入考虑范围则至关重要。我们对其他一些基于网络结构的系统也必须采取类似的谨慎态度。例如，像艾滋病之类的传染病的蔓延就受到某些人群内部无保护性关系模式的强烈影响。同样，流动性冲击则取決于银行间货币交换网络的相互交织。

上述所有例子都是所谓涌现现象的例子。此种现象乃无法通过观察构成系统的单个元素而进行预测的集体行为。通常，呈现这些现象的系统被称为复杂系统。比如，单个的蚂蚁是相对笨批的昆虫，但众多蚂蚁一起则能够进行如修建蚁或者储存大量食物这样复杂的活动。而在人类社会中，社会秩序产生于自主个体的结合，尽管他们的利益往往相互沖突，但最终仍然合力执行凭一己之力无法完成的任务。类似地，某个鲜活有机体的生命力来自其不同组分的相互作用；互联网应对错误、攻击和信息量高峰的非凡弹性是网络作为整体的性能，而非单个机器运行的结果。

1『原书里这张生物链图，超级震撼。（2021-01-05）』

网络及其所强调的互动，乃理解诸多此类现象的关键。设想两支足球队的球员水准十分相近，最终表现却差异甚远。这种差异很可能取于球员们在场上相互配合的好坏程度。类似地，单个球员可能在联盟球队中表现尚好，而在国家队中却表现欠佳，因为该球员在两个团队中的相对位置有所不同。团队的表现是某种涌现现象，它不仅取決于单个参与者的才能或个体技艺的总和，而且还取決于参与者之间所形成的互动网络。许多涌现现象都严重依赖于其底层的网络结构。

网络方法将所有注意力都集中在了单个系统内相互作用的全局结构之上，而每个组成部分的具体属性均被忽略。结果，像计算机网络、生态系统或者社会群体等十分不同的系统都用同一种工具来描绘，那就是图（graph），即由多种关联所结成的一种单一的节点架构。这个方法最初由昂哈德·欧拉在数学领域发展起来，之后扩展至广泛的学科领域，包括大量使用这种方法的社会学，以及最近的物理学、工程学、计算机科学、生物学和其他诸多学科领域。

使用同一种工具来表现差异显著的不同系统只能以某种高度抽象的方式完成。系统细节描述的缺失在普适形式中得到弥补，即将十分不同的系统视作相同理论结构的不同实现形式而加以考虑。由此观之，计算机病毒的传播可能与流感类似；劫持一个路由器可能与某个物种在生态系统中的灭绝有着相同的影响；而万维网的增长则能与科学文献的增长放在一起比较。

这条推理线索提供了诸多洞见。比如，把系统呈现为图能让我们察觉到那些将明显不相关元素囊括在内的大规模结构。2003 年，瑞士电网中的一个小事故角触发了一场大规模停电事件，其影响波及 1000 公里之外的西西里岛。专注网络结构让我们看到，遥远事物之间最终可能通过难以置信的关系或传播短路径而强烈地关联着。地理和社会上相互隔离的两个个体 —— 比如某个热帯雨林中的居民和伦敦金融城中的某位经理 —— 仅通过六度分隔（six degrees of separation）就能相互关联，这个最近的观察与现实相去不远。并且，这种现象可用社会关系的网络结构加以解释。

网络方法还揭示出系统的另一个重要特征，即某些不受外部控制而发展起来的系统仍然能够随机发展出某种内部秩序。细胞或生态系统并非「设计」而成，但仍以某种牢固的方式起作用。类似地，社会群体及社会趋势源于大量不同的压力和动机，但仍然展现出清晰和确定的图景。而互联网和万维网则在缺乏任何监管机构的情况下兴盛起来，并由大量不相关的因素所推动，但它们通常还是按照一致且有效的方式运转。所有这些现象都是自组织过程，即系统内部秩序和组织并非外部干预或整体设计的结果，而是局部机制或倾向在成千上万次相互作用中迭代产生的现象。网络模型能够以清楚和自然的方式描述自组织在诸多系统中是如何产生的。同样，网络让我们能够更好地理解诸如计算机病毒的快速传、大规模流行病、基础设施的突然崩溃，以及社交恐惧症或音乐流行之爆发等各种动态过程。

在复杂、涌现以及自组织系统的研究领域（即关于复杂性的现代科学）中，网络作为通用的数学框架而变得愈发重要，涉及大量数据时尤其如此。这通常体现于个人在搜索引擎中的累积查询、社交网站的更新、在线支付、信用卡数据、金融交易、移动电话中的 GPS（全球定位系）位置等情况中在所有这些情形下，网络对于整理和组织这些数据，进而将个人、产品和新闻等相互关联而言是重要的工具。类似地，分子生物学则越来越依赖计算策略以便在其自身产生的大量数据中找到秩序。科学、技术、健康、环境和社会等许多其他领域也是如此。在所有 6 这些情况中，网络正成为掲示复杂性之隐藏结构的典范。

## 0201. A Fruitful Approach

富有成效的方法

### 2.1 Crossing Euler's bridges

In the Russian city of Kaliningrad, the island of Kneiphof stands in the Pregel River. Three centuries ago, the city was in Prussia, it was called Königsberg, and at that time seven bridges connected the island with the rest of the city (Figure 2 top). A riddle was popular in the town: was it possible to walk across the seven bridges, without crossing any of them twice? Nobody had ever been able to do this successfully. On the other hand, no formal proof was available about the feasibility of such a walk. The solution came from one of the most famous mathematicians of all times. In 1736, Leonard Euler drew a map of Königsberg in an unusual fashion. He represented the portions of mainland and the island as dots, and the bridges as lines, connecting the dots with each other (Figure 2 bottom).

When we cast the problem in this form, things become easier. By showing the network out of the city, Euler proved that the walk was impossible. His explanation is based on the following observation: for such a walk to be feasible, all the dots along the path must have an even number of connections. This is because every time one enters any part of the city via a bridge, one must leave via a different bridge. In general, each area must have an even number of bridges, e.g. 2, 4, 6. Only the start points and end points of the walk can have an odd number of links: at the start point, there can be only one bridge; and the same holds for the end point. Unfortunately, the graph of Königsberg has all the vertices with an odd number of links. Therefore it is impossible to walk only once over all the bridges.

2『哥尼斯堡七桥之谜的洞见，做一张信息数据卡片。（2021-02-09）』

Such a simpilified mathematical map of Königsberg is the first example of a graph. Mathematicians call the dots and lines forming it (respectively) vertices and edges. Nowadays, Euler is credited for having started a whole branch of mathematics, built on graph analysis. His intuition can be considered the first, foundational moment of network science. After him, many mathematicians studied the formal properties of networks, while scientists applied them to a wide range of problems: electrical circuits by G. R. Kirchhoff in 1845, isomers of organic components by A. Cayley in 1857, the mathematical concept known as the Hamiltonian cycle by W. R. Hamilton in 1858, etc. One famous application is the map colouring problem, proposed in the mid-19th century. At that time, geographers were sorting out the minimum number of colours needed to draw maps, where adjacent countries have different colours. This was more than a theoretical problem: given the large number of countries and the reduced quantity of different inks available in the print industry, it was essential to be able to use the minimum number of colours. Empirically, three colours were not enough while four seemed to work well. The first proof that the solution was indeed four was obtained only in 1976. It is based on representing a map as a graph, where nodes are the countries and an edge is drawn between two of them if they share a border.

穿越欧拉之桥

在俄罗斯的加里宁格勒市，一座名为奈佛夫的岛屿坐落于普雷格尔河内。该市 300 年前曾隶属于普鲁土王国，彼时唤作哥尼斯堡，而奈佛夫岛与该市其余部分则由七座桥相互连接（图 2 上）。当时的城里流行着一个谜题：是否可能在不重复走过一座桥的情況下，遍历所有七座桥？

之前没有任何人成功做到这一点。另一方面，对这种走法的可行性，当时也不存在任何形式证明。而其解决方案来自古往今来最著名的数学家之一。1736 年，菜昂哈德·欧拉以一种不寻常的方式画出了哥尼斯堡市的地图。他将陆地和岛屿的部分表示为点，而桥则为连接各点的线（图 2 下）。

当我们以这种方式看待该问题，事情就变得更加容易了。通过展示城市的网络结构，欧拉证明了谜题中的走法不可能。他的解释基于以下观察：若此种走法可行，则路程沿线所有点的连接数必为偶数。这是因为每当某人通过一座桥进入该市的任何部分时，他必须通过另外一座不同的桥离开。总之每个区域必须有偶数座桥，比如 2 座、4 座、6 座等等。只有起点和终点可以有奇数个连接数：起点只能有一座桥，终点亦复如此。不幸的是，哥尼斯堡地图所有顶点的连接数均为奇数。因此，人们不可能一次性谝历所有桥而不重复。

图 2 版画中的哥尼斯堡（上），即现在的加里宁格，它表现了哥尼斯堡七桥之谜，菜昂哈德·欧拉将其表示为一幅简图（下）

哥尼斯堡地图这种简单的数学图是图论的首个例子。数学家将构成这幅图的点和线分别称为顶点和边。如今，欧拉已经因为开启了一整个建立在图解分析基础之上的数学分支而被人们铭记。他的这种直觉可被认为是网络科学的首个创立契机。在他之后，许多数学家都曾研究过网络的形式特征，科学家则将它们应用于更加广泛的问题之中：1845 年 G.R.基尔霍夫的电路，1857 年 A.凯利的有机成分异构体，1858 年由 W.R.哈密顿提出的「哈密顿圏」，等等。其中一个著名的应用是于 19 世纪中期提出的「地图着色问题」。当时，地理学家正在设法计算出绘制地图所需的最小颜色数量，其中相邻的国家应有不同的颜色。这不仅仅是个理论问题：考虑到为数众多的国家和印刷行业中数量有限的不同油墨，使用最少数量的颜色显得至关重要。从经验角度看，三种颜色不够用，四种颜色则似乎很奏效。人们直到 1976 年オ证实了解决方案确为四种颜色。证明基于将一张地图以图的方式呈现出来，其中的节点为国家，边则画在两个共享一个边界的国家之间。

### 2.2 Runaway girls, Australian peoples, and Chicago workers

In the autumn of 1932, fourteen An engraving of Königsberg (top)ugu girls ran away in a period of just two weeks from Hudson School for Girls, in New York State. This was much more than the usual rate of runaways. School managers then decided to look into the individual personalities of the girls, to understand this phenomenon. Since no striking evidence of particular differences in the girls’ personalities was found, the psychiatrist Jacob Moreno proposed a completely different explanation. He suggested that this large number was triggered by the position of runaways in the girls’ social network. Moreno, together with Helen Jennings, mapped the social ties between the students, using sociometry, a technique for identifying relations between individuals. They found that these ties were the main channel through which the idea of running away spread among the girls. The position of an individual in the friendship network was crucial for replicating the behaviour of the runaway girls.

Moreno was one of the first researchers to apply the idea of network to society. After Euler’s intuition, his work is a second and crucial step in network science foundations, starting one of the most important lines of network science: the analysis of social networks. Thirty years later, anthropologists applied a similar approach to kinship relations in tribes such as the Arunda people in Australia. In this case, the connections were drawn between individuals who were relatives. Researchers found that the resulting diagrams responded to elegant mathematical structures. These and other results suggested that neat social structures, or even universal laws, could be found underneath the disorder of the human social world. Since then, social sciences have widely deployed the concept of network to represent social structure. Many other studies followed these seminal ones, focusing on the circles of women in southern America (by A. Davis, B. B. Gardner, and M. R. Gardner in 1941), groups of factory workers in Chicago (by E. Mayo in 1939), friendship between schoolchildren (by A. Rapoport in 1961), and the relations between drug addicts in the city of Colorado Springs (by Richard B. Rothenberg et al. in 1995), among others.

出走的女孩，澳大利亚人和芝加哥工人

1932 年的秋天，在两个星期内有 14 名女孩从位于纽约州的哈德森女子学校中出走。这种出走率不同寻常。学校管理层于是决定调查这些女孩的个性，以便理解这种现象。由于没有发现女孩们的性格有特殊差异的明显证据，精神科医生雅各布·莫雷诺便提出了一种完全不同的解释。他指出这种大规模出走情形是由出走女孩们在社交网络中的位置引发的。莫雷诺和海伦·詹宁斯一起利用社会计量学，即一种能够识别个体之间关系的技术，绘制了学生之间的社会关系图。他们发现，这些关系是出走的想法在女孩们之间传播的主要渠道。个人在友谊网络中的位置对其模仿出走女孩的行为至关重要。

莫雷诺是第一批将网络理念应用于社会的研究者之一。继欧拉的直觉之后，他的研究成为网络科学创立的第二个关键步骤，它开启了网络科学最重要的分支之一：社交网络分析。30 年之后，人类学家采用了类似的方法研究部落的亲属关系，比如对澳大利亚阿伦达人部落的研究。在这个案例中，互为亲属的人们之间的联系图得到绘制。研究人员发现，他们得到的结果图对应着优雅的数学结构。这些以及其他结果都表明，在人类社会的无序之下，暗含着精巧的社会结构，甚至是普遍法则。从那时起，社会科学便广泛运用网络概念来呈现社会结构。

许多其他的研究也遵循着这些最初的研究方法，比如，对南美洲妇女群体（A.戴维斯、B.B.加德纳以及 M.R.加德纳等人，1941）、芝加哥工厂的工人群体（E.梅奥，1939）、学童之间的友谊（A.拉波波特，1961），以及对科罗拉多州斯普林斯市吸毒者之间关系的研究（理查德·B.罗隊伯格等人，1995），诸如此类。

### 2.3 Random connections

The third important moment in the foundation of network science came with the publication of a set of papers by the two mathematicians Paul Erd ő s and Alfréd Rényi, in 1959–61. Erd ő s, one of the most important mathematicians of the 20th century, has been described as 「a man who loved only numbers.」Partly wrong: he loved graphs too. The two theorists studied a mathematical model representing a graph where vertices are connected to each other completely at random. This model, lately known as Random Graph, was first proposed in 1951, in a paper by mathematics researchers Ray Salomonoff and Anatol Rapoport.

The random graph is a very simplified model, and its properties are very different from those of real networks. For example, randomness and chance could indeed play an important role in meeting new friends, but the formation of friendship networks is certainly related to many other factors, such as social class, common languages, affinity etc. However, the random graph model is very important because it quantifies the properties of a totally random network. Random graphs can be used as a benchmark, or null case, for any real network. This means that a random graph can be used in comparison to a real-world network, to understand how much chance has shaped the latter, and to what extent other criteria have played a role.

The simplest recipe for building a random graph is the following. We take all the possible pairs of vertices. For each pair, we toss a coin: if + the result is heads, we draw a link; otherwise we pass to the next pair, until all the pairs are finished (this means drawing the link with a probability p = 1/2, but we may use whatever value of p). Typically, the creation of the graph and its study are not done manually. Scientists use computer programs and draw the resulting network on paper or on computer screen. However, this becomes increasing difficult when the network is large. Moreover, it is hard to study an interwoven structure just by visual inspection. A better and quantitative insight comes from studying the graph as an abstract object, by means of mathematical tools. Computers can also help: simulation allows us to build, within the「mind」of a computer, a faithful realization of the model, and then make measurements of it as if it were a real object. If we want to compare the abstract model with a real-world network, now we just need to compare the measures in both cases.

Since its introduction in the sixties, the random graph model has become one of the most successful mathematical models, despite its loose connection with reality. Nowadays it is a benchmark of comparison for all networks, since any deviations from this model suggest the presence of some kind of structure, order, regularity, and non-randomness in many real-world networks.

随机联系

网络科学创立的第三个重要时刻则随着保罗·埃尔德什和阿尔弗雷德·雷尼这两位数学家在 1959 年到 1961 年间一系列论文的发表而到来。埃尔德什是 20 世纪最重要的数学家之一，人们称他为「数字情种」。这句话不全对 —— 他也钟爱着图形。这两位理论家研究了某种表示图的数学模型，其中的顶点完全随机地连接。数学研究人员雷·萨洛莫诺夫和阿纳托尔·拉波波特最早于 1951 年在一篇论文中提出了这种后来被称作随机图的模型。

随机图是一种十分简化的模型，其特征与那些真实网络載然不同。比如，随机性和概率的确可能在结交新朋友的过程中发挥重要作用，但是友谊网络的形成肯定也与许多其他因素相关，比如社会阶层、共同语言、吸引力等等。然而，随机图模型仍然非常重要，因为它量化了完全随机网络的性质。随机图能用作任何真实网络的基准或无效状态。这意味着，我们能将随机图与真实世界的网络进行对比，进而了解概率在多大程度上塑造了后者，以及其他标准在何种程度上起了作用。

以下是构建随机图的最简单方法。我们取所有可能的顶点对，然后为每一对顶点抛掷硬币：如果结果是正面朝上，则画出一个连线；否则我们转向下一对顶点，直到遍历所有顶点对（这意味着我们以 p=1/2 的概率绘制顶点连线，但可能会用到 p 的任意值）。通常，图的创建及相关研究都不是人们手动完成的。科学家运用计算机程序，在图纸或电脑屏幕上绘制生成网络图。然而，当网络模很大时，这项工作就会变得越发困难。

此外，人们仅通过目测很难研究相互交织的结构。运用数学工具将图作为抽象对象进行研究能够提供更好的量化的见解。计算机对此也有帮助：模拟使我们能够在计算机的「头脑」中将这种模型可靠地具象化，然后对其进行测量，就像它是个真实的物体一样。如果我们想要将抽象模型与真实世界网络进行比较，现在只需要比较两种情況下的测量数据。

自上世纪 60 年代被引进以来，随机图模型已成为最成功的数学模型之ー，尽管它与现实的联系并不紧密。现在，它是所有网络进行比对的基准，因为任何对此模型的偏离都表明了在许多现实世界网络中存在着某种结构、秩序、规律性和非随机性。

### 2.4 Nets to Fish for Information

In the wake of the terrorist attacks in New York in 2001, in Madrid in 2004, and in London in 2005, several governments have proposed, as an anti-terrorist measure, the storage of electronic traffic data. In this proposal, years of phone calls and emails between citizens would be recorded for safety purposes. The content of the messages would not be stored: it would be enough to record only senders and recipients (and sometimes time and place of communication). As police forces know, even this simple map of who is connected with whom is a powerful instrument in tracking people's activity. Indeed from a sketch of phone calls, we can deduce habits, circles of friends, and various other data about a person.

This is a very practical example — and a very debated one — of the basic approach of network science. A complex system is represented as a graph — a set of equal elements connected by equal interactions — ignoring the detailed features of its constituents, and the specific nature of their relations. This procedure may seem too drastic, but still it allows us to capture more information than expected at first sight. A proof of the effectiveness of this approach is the friendship advice system contained in many online social networks, such as Facebook or LinkedIn. The idea is simple: you are likely to know the friends of your friends. As simple as it is, it works most of the times. This method, called educated guess, is also behind the systems that suggest books or other items in online shops. The software of these companies exploits networks of goods associated with each consumer. This is why commercial companies store a great deal of electronic data, including email messages and online social network data: they know that this information is extremely useful.

The basic approach of network science can be applied to a broad set of systems. For example, an ecosystem composed of hundreds of species, where each one extracts energy from others by means of different strategies of predation. In the network approach, this is represented by a set of identical vertices connected by a set of identical edges. The same strategy is applied to systems ranging from the Internet (hundreds of thousands of computers, routers, exchange points, etc., connected by telephone lines, fibre optic cables, satellite communications, etc.) to a human population (a huge number of a bare architecture of nodes actors with different purposes and roles, connected by a variety of relations). While the network approach eliminates many of the individual features of the phenomenon considered, it still maintains some of its specific features. Namely, it does not alter the size of the system — i.e. the number of its elements — or the pattern of interaction — i.e. the specific set of connections between elements. Such a simplified model is nevertheless enough to capture the properties of the system.

捕获信息之网

当纽约、马德里、伦敦分别于 2001、2004、2005 年遭遇死灰复燃般的恐怖袭击之后，一些政府机构提议存储电子信息流数据，并将其作为一项反恐措施。在这项提议中，公民之间多年的电话和电邮都会以安全的名义被记录在案。具体的通信内容则不会被储存，仅记录信息的发出者和接收者便已足够（有时候还包括通信的时间和地点信息）。正如警方所知晓的那样，即便这种简单的谁与谁之间相互关联的图景也是追踪人们活动的强大工具。的确，略略看一下某人的电话记录，我们就可以推断出他的习惯、朋友圏以及各种相关的其他数据。

这是网络科学基本方法的一个非常实际也具争议的例子。复杂系統由图 一一 通过同样的相互作用而彼此关联的一组等价元素 一一 表示，却忽略了其组成部分的详细特征，以及它们之间关系的具体性质。这一做法似乎过于激进，但它仍然让我们能够捕获到比乍看之下可预期到的更多的信息。这种方法的一个有效证明便是内嵌于诸多在线社交网络中的朋友推荐系统，比如「脸书」或「领英」。其中的想法很简单：你很可能认识你朋友的朋友。虽然很简单，却在多数情况下都有效。这种方法被称为有根据的推测，它也是很多在线商店的书籍或其他商品推荐系统的基础。这些公司的软件利用了与每个消费者相关的商品网络。这就是为何商业公司会储存大量的电子数据，包括电子邮件和在线社交网络数据 一一 它们知道这种信息十分有用。

网络科学的基本方法可应用于广泛的系统之中。例如由数百个物种组成的生态系统，其中每个物种通过不同的捕食策略从其他物种中提取能量。在网络方法中，这种情況由一组相同的边连接起来的一组相同顶点表示。同样的策略被应用于从互联网（通过电话线、光纤电缆、卫星通信等方式连接起来的无数计算机、路由器和交互站点等）到人口族群（通过各种关系相互联系且拥有不同目的和身份的大量行动者）的各种系之中。尽管网络方法消除了所考虑现象的许多个别特征，它仍然保留了个体的某些特征。也就是说，这种方法并不改变系统的大小 ー一 系统元素的数量，也不会改变相互作用的模式 一一 元素之间的特定连接集合。然而这种简化的模型仍然足以捕获系统的特性。

### 2.5 From individuals to Groups

There are two possible approaches when dealing with a situation where many different elements interact in different ways. In the first approach, we identify the basic constituents and interactions between them. By studying each element on its own, we can then deduce the behaviour of the system as the sum of its individual elements. For example, ecologists can describe the features of an ecosystem by listing prey and predators of every single species. Computer scientists describe a network of computers by focusing on the features and protocols of each different machine. Psychologists study social relations by describing the behaviour of each social actor in his or her circle. A second strategy, different from the first one, consists in putting many elements together into a few homogeneous groups. For example, sociologists and political scientists usually split society into social classes, genders, levels of education, ethnicities, nations, etc. Similarly, epidemiologists often separate the population into a limited set of compartments: healthy individuals, infected, immunized, etc. Ecologists can also use this approach by aggregating into groups (trophic species) all the species that have similar roles in a foodweb.

The network approach tries to complement these two points of view. Many phenomena are impossible to explain if one focuses only on the behaviour of individual elements. For example, the dynamics of a species population within an ecosystem do not depend on the features of that species alone: the global network of prey–predator interactions must be taken into account. On the other hand, focusing on big classes of elements may not be useful either. For example, the political phenomena taking place in a country are hardly the outcome of a pre-existing national identity but rather of the specific pattern of social relations within that country. The network approach is somewhere between the description by individual elements and the description by big groups, bridging the two of them. In a certain sense, networks try to explain how a set of isolated elements are transformed, through a pattern of interactions, into groups and communities. In all cases where this pattern is relevant, the network approach provides essential insights.

从个体到群体

在处理多种不同元素以不同方式相互作用的情况时，存在两种可能的方法。第一种方法是确认这种情况中的基本成分以及它们之间的相互作用。通过研究每个元素本身，我们可以将系统的行为推导为个体元素的加总。例如，生态学家可以通过列出每个物种的猎物和捕食者来描述生态系统的特征。计算机科学家通过关注每个不同机器的特征和协议来描述计算机网络。心理学家则通过描述每个社交者在他的子中的行为来研究社会关系。与第一种策略不同，第二种策略旨在将许多元素组合成为若干同类的群体。例如，社会学家和政治学家通常按照社会阶层、性别、教育水平、种族、国家等因素对社会进行划分。同样，流行病学家则常常将人口分成一组有限的「区划」：健康的、感染的、免疫的个体等。生态学家也能用同样的方法将所有在食物网中扮演类似角色的物种汇集成群组（即营养物种）。

2『两种方式来处理多种不同元素以不同方式相互作用的系统（个体法、分组法），以及进阶版的网络法。网络分析法做一张术语卡片。（2021-02-09）』——已完成

网络方法试图补充这两种策略。若我们只关注个体元素的行为，许多现象就无法得到解释。例如，生态系统内物种的数量动态并不单单依赖于该物种自身的特征，猎物-捕食者相互作用的全局网络也必须考虑在内。另一方面，专注于大类的元素也可能没什么用。比如，一国发生的政治现象基本上不是由先前存在的国家认同引起的，而是该国内部社会关系的具体模式运作的结果。网络方法则介于通过单个元素和通过大群组进行的描述之间，并将二者连接起来。在某种意义上，网络试图解释一组孤立的元素是如何通过相互作用的模式转化为群体和共同体的。在与这种模式相关的所有情况下，网络方法都提供了重要的洞见。

### 2.6 Geography versus netography

At the beginning of the 20th century, London’s underground train service (the Tube) became so intricate that more and more complicated maps had to be issued from time to time, in order to orient the travellers. In 1931, after many attempts, Henry Beck, an employee of the company, changed the criteria for drawing the chart. Instead of embedding the lines on top of an actual map of London, Beck placed them in an abstract space (Figure 3). Stations were represented by well-spaced dots. Tube connections became straight lines with neat angles of 45 or 90 degrees. This map has little to do with the real positions and distances of stations, but it is much clearer and more useful for the passengers. Those travelling on the Tube network are not interested in its geographic features: the information about the sequence of stations and the intersection of Tube lines is enough.

Henry Beck’s London’s Tube map is basically a graph. His solution to the mapping problem exploited a basic feature of the network approach: in networks, topology is more important than metrics. That is, what is connected to what is more important than how far apart two things are: in the other words, the physical geography is less important than the netography of the graph. The difference between these two concepts is shown in Figure 4. The three images represented in the picture are different from a metric point of view. That is, the positions of nodes in space and the lengths of links are different. However, from the topological point of view they are identical: they are just three different representations of the same graph. In the network representation, the connections between the elements of a system are much more important than their specific positions in space and their relative distances.

The focus on topology is one of its biggest strengths of the network approach, useful whenever topology is more relevant than metrics. For example, an email sent from New York reaches an office in London in the same time as one sent from the office next door. Even on the Internet, a material infrastructure embedded in geographical space, the pattern of the connections is more important than the physical distance. In social networks, the relevance of topology means that social structure matters. Lionel Messi is nowadays one of the best football players in the world. However, his performance differs according to which team he is playing in (either Argentina or FC Barcelona). Some social scientists have argued that the network of Messi’s relations with other players in Argentina is different from that in FC Barcelona. According to their research, this results in the player carrying a heavier「weight」in the former case: this may explain, at least in part, the difference in his performance. Similar phenomena appear also in more complicated social games, where an individual’s outcome can be strongly influenced by his or her position in a network of relations.

地理与「网络图」

20 世纪初，伦敦的地铁服务变得十分复杂，以至于人们必须不时地发布愈来愈多的地图以便为出行者提供向导。1931 年，经过多次尝试，地铁公司的雇员亨利·贝克改变了绘制地铁路线图的标准。与那种将地铁路线嵌入伦敦实际地图之上的做法相反，贝克将它们置于抽象的空间中（图 3）。站点由间隔合适的点表示，而线路的连接则全部变成了具有 45 或 90 度角的直线。这个地图无关车站的真实位置及其相互之间的实际距离，但它对乘客而言更加清楚且有用。乘用地铁网络的人对其地理特征不感兴趣，有车站的序和地铁路线的交汇信息便已足够。

图 3 伦地铁的「度量」示意图（上）与「拓扑」示意图（下）。尽管车站的实际位置和相对距离都未呈现在拓扑图中，它却是地铁服务的更佳思维导图

1『原来地铁站里的地图，这么有讲究的。（2021-01-05）』

亨利·贝克的伦敦地铁图基本上就是一个图。他解决映射问题的方案利用了网络方法的一个基本特征：在网络中，拓扑比度量更为重要。也就是说，何物与何物相互关联比它们相隔多远更加重要。换句话说，图的实际地理情形不如其「网络图」重要。这两个概念的差异如图 4 所示。从度量角度看图中呈现的三个图形有所不同。也就是说，空间中的节点位置和节点连线的长度有所不同。然而，从拓学的角度看，它们是相同的 一一 它们只是同一个图的三种不同呈现方式。在网络的表示方式中，系统元素之间的关联比它们的相对距离以及在空间中的具体位置要重要得多。

对拓扑学的关注是网络方法的最大优势之一，当拓扑与度量相比更为适用时，网络方法就是有用的。例如，从纽约发送至伦敦某办公室的电子邮件会与来自其隔壁办公室的邮件同时抵达。即便在互联网这种嵌入地理空间的实体基础设施中，连接的模式也比物理距离更加重要。在社交网络中，拓扑的实用性意味着社会结构很重要。里奥内尔·梅西是当今世界最好的足球运动员之ー。然而，他的表现却随着他所效力球队（比如阿根廷国家队或者巴塞罗那足球俱乐部队）的不同而有所不同。一些社会科学家认为，梅西在阿根廷国家队中与其他队员之间的关系网络不同于他在巴塞罗那足球俱乐部队中的关系网络。根据他们的研究，这会导致球员在前一种情況下背负更重的「负担」，这至少能部分解释他在不同球队中的表现差异。类似的现象也出现在更加复杂的社交「游戏」中，个人在其中的境况会受到他或她在关系网络中所处位置的强烈影响。

### 2.7 Chains, Grids, and Networks

The network approach reduces complex systems to a bare architecture of nodes and links. This is a substantial simplification, but still the resulting graph may not be so easy to interpret: this is the case with the tricky illustration shown in Figure 4. Even a graph as simple as an innocent chain of nodes can be a rather complicated object to handle. A chain may represent, for example, a fire brigade moving a bucket of water; or a food chain of species, in which the first predates the second, which predates the third, and so on; or a business-to-business supply structure: a set of companies in which each one supp very short introduction egulies the next one.

Imagine a production chain of five companies (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5). Along this chain, any of them can make a deal with either of its two neighbours. The rule is that each company can close only one contract: for example, if 3 closes a deal with 2, it cannot have arrangements with 4. Given this simple structure and rule, it turns out that nodes 1 and 5 have less bargaining power, since they have fewer alternatives. This makes nodes 2 and 4 stronger, and (unexpectedly) it weakens node 3. Indeed, node 3 has only strong nodes to deal with, and therefore it ends up having less convenient deals. Something as simple as a linear sequence of nodes does indeed yield a rather complex landscape. This example shows what sociologists call an exclusion mechanism. Far from being a theoretical situation, this is commonly experienced in economics, when the establishment of a commercial relation between two parts excludes a third node.

To further complicate the question, one has to take into account that real-world systems are rarely as simple as a chain. In the past, scientists have represented complex systems through regular grids or lattices, instead of using graphs. These objects are composed of many elements — representing people, animals, computers, etc. — usually arranged along a regular pattern of connections, like pieces on a chessboard connecting only with their four neighbours. This regular structure makes systems much easier to handle by mathematical calculation and by computer simulation than when using a graph.

The lattice choice, albeit simpler with respect to a graph, introduces nevertheless a strong limitation. In fact, a lattice is suitable only for representing systems carefully designed or subject to strong constraints. These might be, for example, the arrays of processors in a computing cluster or verbal communications between chain workers in a noisy workplace. In lattices, every node is linked to a fixed number of nearest neighbours, while in the vast majority of real-world cases, links connect a variable number of elements, no matter whether close to or far away from each other. The ability to capture this disorder is one of the great advantages of the network approach.

Much of this disorder is encoded in a crucial quantity: the degree, that is, the number of edges attached to each node. If a node is a web page, the degree represents the number of links it receives from other pages. If a node is a species, the degree is the number of species it depends on for feeding. If a node is an individual, the degree is the number of acquaintances. This circle can be related to what sociologist Peter Marsden has called a core discussion network: the set of people (friends, partners, family members, current and past schoolmates, co-workers, neighbours, fellow members of clubs, professional advisers, consultants, etc.) with whom one discusses important matters or spends time.

链条、网格和网络

网络方法将复杂系统简化为单一的点线架构。这是一个重大的简化，但其得出的结果图却可能不是那么容易得到解释：这便是图 4 所示的棘手例子展示的情况。甚至一幅仅由节点连接而成的链条图也可以是一个处理起来相当复杂的对象。一个链条可以代表比如搬运一桶水的消防队；或者物种的食物链，其中，第一个捕食第二个，第二个捕食第三个，以此类推；或者企业之间的供应结构 一一 一系列公司中每个公司供给下个公司。

想象一下五家公司（公司 1, 2, 3, 4 和 5）的生产链。在这个链条沿线，其中任何一家公司都能与其两个邻居之一达成交易。其中的规则为，每个公司只能签订一份合同。例如，如果公司 3 与公司 2 达成了交易，则它不能与公司 4 另有协议安排。给定了这个简单的结构和规则，结果便是位于节点 1 和节点 5 的公司议价能力更低，因为它们的选择更少。这导致公司 2 和公司 4 更加强大，并且（意外地）削弱了位于节点 3 上的公司。确实，节点 3 上的公司只得应付更加强大的公司，因此，它最终只能达成不那么有利的交易。简单如节点线性序列这样的事物确实产生了相当复杂的景观。社会学家将这个例子呈现的现象称为排斥机制。这远非理论中的情況，而是经济学中经常能遇到的情形 一一 当两个公司之间建立商业关系以排除第三方时便是这样。

为了进一步深入这个问题，人们必须考虑到现实中的系统绝少如链条这般简单。在过去，科学家用规则网格或晶格表示复杂的系统，而非使用图。这些对象由许多元素组成 —— 分别代表人、动物、计算机等等 一一 它们通常按照规则的连接模式排列，例如棋盘上的棋子仅与其四邻的棋子相连。相对于用图表示而言，这种规则结构使得系统能够更容易被数学计算和计算机模拟这两种方式处理。

尽管格子相对于图而言更加简单，但它引入了强烈的限制条件。事实上，一个格子仅适于呈现经过精心设计或受到强烈约束的系统。比如，这些系统可能是某个计算集群的处理器阵列，或者某个嘈杂工作场所中彼此关联的工人之间的语言交流。在格子框架中，每个节点都连接着固定数量的最近连接点，而在绝大多数真实情况中，这些连接则关联着数量可变的元素，无论它们彼此是邻近还是相隔很远。捕获这种混乱状态的能力是网络方法的最大优点之一。

大部分这种无序状态都被编码为某种关键的数量 一一 度数，即附着于每个节点之上的边数。如果节点是网页，度数则表示了该网页与其他页面的链接数量。如果节点是物种，度数则表示了该物种赖以生存的物种数量。如果节点是一个人，度数则表示了其熟人的数量。这个圏子能与社会学家彼得·马斯登所谓的核心讨论网络联系起来，即那些可与之讨论重要事宜或打发时间的人群（朋友、伙伴、家庭成员、现在和过去的同学、同事、邻居、俱乐部伙伴、专业顾问、咨询员等等）。

### 2.8 Mapping Relationships

Two people can have an infinite set of possible relations. They may share attitudes, ideas, or gender. They may be friends, relatives, or co-workers. They may be sexual partners or simply play in the same football team. Furthermore, two or more of these connections may simultaneously occur between the same couple of people. Some of them are cooperative relations, while others convey open hostility, with an entire spectrum possible in between. Finally, some can be perceived only by one side and ignored by the other (e.g. the fans of a rock star feel linked to him, while the star may simply ignore them). Sociology has classified a broad range of possible links between individuals (Table 1). The tendency to have several kinds of relationships in social networks is called multiplexity. But this phenomenon appears in many other networks: for example, two species can be connected by different strategies of predation, two computers by different cables or wireless connections, etc.

We can modify a basic graph to take into account this multiplexity, e.g. by attatching specific tags to edges. For instance, we can take into account whether a connection is positive or negative. Species are linked by predation (negative), but also by mutualism (e.g. the positive relation established between flowering plants and pollinators). People can be enemies (negative) or friends (positive). A web page can link to another web page to criticize its content (negative) or to advertise it (positive). 

Adding this simple binary feature complicates things a lot. Imagine a group of three people, Alice, Bob, and Carol. When positive relations connect all of them, everything is fine. Alternatively, Alice and Bob may be linked by friendship but both have hostile relations towards Carol. Things get complicated when the situation is reversed: Alice has positive relations with both Bob and Carol, but the two of them hate each other. And things get really problematic when everybody hates everybody else. According to sociology, the first and the second situation are structurally balanced, while the third and the fourth are not. In 2006, mathematician Tibor Antal and physicists Paul Krapivsky and Sidney Redner applied this concept to the shifting diplomatic alliances between six European countries before the First World War. They showed that their alliance gradually evolved into a structurally balanced situation, where either strong alliances were established or clear common enemies were identified. The six countries became divided into two groups (on one side, Britain, France, and Russia; on the other, Austria-Hungary, Germany, and Italy), each of them allied to all the countries in its group and enemy to all the countries in the other group. Soon after this situation had come about, the war broke out. This example shows that structural balance is not necessarily something desirable.

Table 1. A classification of ties in social networks.

Graph theory allows us to encode in edges more complicated relationships, as when connections are not reciprocal. Wolves predate sheep, blogs link to large newspapers, and some people fell in love with others; the reverse is seldom true. In this case, the connections in the graph are a sort of one-way street where we can travel in one direction but not backwards. If a direction is attached to the edges, the resulting structure is a directed graph where links are indicated by an arrow. In these networks we have both in-degree and out-degree, measuring the number of inbound and outbound links of a node, respectively.

The relations considered so far are binary: that is, they acquire only two values. Such dichotomous connections either exist or do not: for example, being married to somebody or being employed by somebody. Statistically, however, these are exceptions: in most cases, relations display a broad variation of intensity. Predation is counted in the number of prey eaten, web pages can be connected by a sporadic link or by a large number of connections, and love can range from slight attraction to furious passion. Such further features correspond to the weights we can add to the links.

描绘关系

两个人之间可以有无限的可能关系。他们可能共有同样的态度、想法或性别，可能是朋友、亲戚或同事，也可能是性伴侣或者仅仅效力于同一个足球队。此外，这些关系中的两个或更多可以同时发生在同样两个人身上。其中一些是合作关系，另一些则表示公开的敌对，而介于两者之间的关系则有着广泛的可能。最后，一些关系可能仅仅单方面被感知到，而另一方则完全对其忽略（比如，摇滚明星的粉丝可能感觉自己与其有某种联系，而摇滚明星可能完全忽略了他们）。社会学将个体之间广泛的可能联系进行了分类（表 1）。在社交网络中具有多种关系类型的倾向又被称为关系的多重性。但这种现象也出现在许多其他的网络中。例如，两个物种可以通过不同的捕食策略而彼此关联，两个计算机则通过不同的有线或无线连接彼此关联等。

我们可以修改某种基本图来考虑关系的多重性，例如，为关系连线贴上特定的标签等。比如说，我们可以将某种关联是正面还是负面纳入考虑范围。物种通过捕食（负面）或共生（比如在开花植物和授粉者之间建立起的正面关系）而彼此关联。人们可以是敌人（负面）或朋友（正面）。一个网页则可以连接到另外一个网页以批评其内容（负面）或为其做广告（正面）。通过增添这个简单的二进制功能便让事情极大地复杂化了。

想象一个由爱丽丝、鲍勃和卡罗尔组成的三人群体。当他们所有人由正面的关系联系时，一切都安好。又或者，爱丽丝和鲍勃可能是朋友关系，但他们二人均对卡罗尔抱有敌意。当情相反的时候，事情就变得复杂了：爱丽丝与鲍勃和卡罗尔二人都保持着正面的关系，但鲍勃与卡罗尔之间却彼此憎恶。而当他们每个人都彼此憎恶的时候，情况就变得着实棘手了。根据社会学理论，第一种情况和第二种情況在结构上是平衡的，而第三种和第四种情況则相反。

2006 年，数学家蒂博尔·安塔尔和物理学家保罗·克拉皮夫斯基、西徳尼·雷德纳将这个概念应用于第一次世界大战前六个欧洲国家之间外交联盟关系转变的分析之中。他们证明了这六国的联盟逐演化成了一种结构上平衡的状态，在这种情况下，强大的联盟得以建立，或者明确的共同敌人得以确定。这六国后来分裂为两个集团（一方为英国、法国和俄罗斯；另ー方则为奥匈帝国、德国和意大利），每一方的成员国彼此在集团内相互结盟，而对另一方的所有国家保持敌对关系。这种情况出现后不久，战争便爆发了。这个例子表明，结构上的平衡并不必然就是有利的。

表 1 社交网络关系的分类

图论让我们能为边编码更加复杂的关系，当关系并非对称的时候更是如此。狼捕食羊，博客链接到大报，一些人爱上另一些人；相反的情况绝少为真。在这种情况下，图中的关系乃某种单行道，我们可在其中朝着一个方向前进，但不能逆行。如果给边添加方向属性，则得出的结构为有向图，其中的关系由箭头指示。在这些网络中，我们有入度和出度分别测量节点向内与向外的连接数量。

到目前为止，我们所考虑的关系都是二进制的 一一 它们仅有两个值。这种二分关系要么存在，要么不存在：例如，与某人结婚或者被某人雇用。然而，这种关系在统计上都是例外：绝大多数情況下，关系展现出广泛的强度变化。捕食以吃掉猎物的数量计算，网页则能被零星或大量的链接关联，而爱情的强度则从轻微的吸引到强烈的激情不等。这些进一步的特征对应于我们赋予关系的权重。例如，加权网络可能作为个体或事物之间不同交互频率的结果出现。

我们对基本图结构的其他修改也是可能的，且处理这些事物的技术非常有趣。比如，大部分社交网络研究致力于了解不同种类的关系如何互相影响。然而，网络方法的优点在于，在某些情況下，忽略所有或大多数具体细节是合理且有效的：有向网络变得无向，权重被移除，多重连接坍塌为某条单独的边等等。结果表明，这种彻底的简化仍然能够捕获大量信息。

### 3.1 Networkomics

During the eighties and nineties of the last century everything was ‘genetic’ in some way. Newspapers published stories about ‘the gene for homosexuality’, ‘the gene for obesity’, ‘the gene for violence’, or the ‘gene for alcoholism’. This attitude responded to the expectation that the secret of human complexity was hidden in the genome. The DNA — the deoxyribonucleic acid molecule packed in the nucleus of the cell, that contains the genes — was dubbed the ‘software of life’, the program responsible for every single feature of a living being, the code whose dysfunction caused all the diseases. This vision set off a rush to sequence the genome, culminating in the publication of its map in February 2001. Results were quite surprising. Human beings do not have many more genes than a nematode worm, and fewer than some species of rice. It is reasonable that the human genome is almost identical to that of great apes, but the problem is that it is also rather similar to that of mice. The software metaphor did not stand in the face of this evidence: the DNA sequence alone does not explain the observed differences between species, let alone all the features and diseases of a single individual. In fact, there is a long series of steps from the genes to the macroscopic features of a living being. Variations in this path determine different outcomes.

The first layer of complexity above the gene level is given by gene regulation. Genes contained in the DNA are transcribed and translated to produce proteins. Proteins play a central role in almost every aspect of life: muscle movement, blood circulation, acting as enzymes, binding to hormones, etc. Moreover, proteins interact with each other: the production of a protein can be facilitated or hindered by the presence of other proteins in the cell. The delicate balance of these reciprocal influences is crucial for life. For example, the mutations of a single protein, the p53, are implied in a large number of different cancers. These interwoven patterns of activation and inhibition yield the gene regulatory network. In this net, nodes are genes and links are chains of reactions that connect the expression of a gene with that of others.

Protein interact, in all the forms in which they can happen, represent a second layer of complexity. For example, several proteins can bind together. These macromolecules behave as molecular machines, performing functions in the mach An engraving of Königsberg (top)" aid="tradinery of the cell. To do so, they must have the correct geometrical shape to fit with each other. When a protein is folded in the wrong way, several problems can arise. For example, the proteins responsible for the ‘mad cow syndrome’ (Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease) in humans, i.e. the prions, are supposed to be nothing else than misfolded proteins. All the possible physical connections between proteins can be represented as a network. In the protein interaction network the vertices are proteins and an edge is drawn between them if they physically interact in the cell.

Proteins are not enough for making a cell work. The cell interchanges matter, energy, and information with the environment, through many different molecules, involved in millions of reactions. Hunger, satiety, coldness, and in general all the states experienced by the organism, depend on this set of reactions, called metabolism. The chains of reactions that convert one molecule into another, passing through a series of intermediates steps, are called metabolic pathways. However, reactions in cells rarely follow the pattern of an ordered sequence. For example, the final molecule often interacts with the initial one in order to stop the reaction. This feedback process closes a loop in the chain of reactions. The ensemble of all such paths yields an intricate metabolic network.

An organism is therefore the outcome of several layered networks and not only the deterministic result of the simple sequence of genes. Genomics has been joined by epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, etc., the disciplines that study these layers, in what is commonly called the omics revolution. Networks are at the heart of this revolution.

网络组学

上世纪 80 和 90 年代，人们倾向于认为在某种方式上一切都是由基因決定的。报纸上的报道都与「同性恋基因」「肥胖基因」「暴力基因」或者「酗酒基因」有关。这种态度呼应了人们对人类复杂性的秘密隐藏在基因组中的期望。DNA —— 细胞核中包含基因的脱氧核糖核酸分子 —— 又称「生命的软件」，该程序负责生命体的每一个特征，正是其中代码功能的障碍导致了所有的疾病。这种图景引发了人们对基因组进行测序的风潮，而人类基因组图谱于 2001 年 2 月的发布将这个风潮推向了顶点。序的结果令人十分惊讶，人类的基因数并不比线虫多多少，而且比某些种类的水稻基因还少。人类几乎与类人猿有着相同基因组的推断是合理的，但问题是人类基因组也与老鼠类似。软件的隐喻并不支持这一证据：DNA 序列本身并不能解释我们所能观察到的物种差异，更不用说单个个体的所有特征和疾病了。事实上，生物的基因与其相应的宏观特征之间还隔着一系列漫长的步骤。此间的变异决定了不同的结果。

基因之上的第一层复杂性由基因调控给出。包含在 DNA 中的基因被转录和翻译以产生蛋白质。蛋白质几乎在生命的各个方面都起着核心作用：肌肉运动、血液循环、承担酶的作用、结合激素等等。此外，蛋白质还彼此相互作用：蛋白质的产生可能受到细胞内现有蛋白质的促进或阻碍。这些相互影响之间的微妙平衡对于生命而言至关重要。例如，p53 这一单个蛋白质的突就伴随着大量不同的癌症。这些交织的激活和抑制模式产生出了基因调控网络。在这个网络之中，节点为基因，连线则是关联某个基因与其他基因表达的反应链条。

蛋白质以所有可能发生的方式相互作用，这代表着另外一个层面的复杂性。例如，一些蛋白质可以结合在一起。这些大分子像分子机器一样起作用，它们在细胞这种机器中发挥着自己的功能。为此，蛋白质必须具备正确的几何形状以彼此契合。当蛋白质以错误的方式折叠时，就可能出现一些问题。比如，人体中对应「疯牛综合征」（又称克雅二氏病）的蛋白质（即朊病毒）就被认为是错误折叠的。蛋白质之间所有可能的实体联系可表示为网络。在蛋白质相互作用网络中，顶点为蛋白质，而如果蛋白质在细胞中的确相互作用，则可在相应的点之间画出一条边。

蛋白质并不足以让细胞工作。细胞通过许多不同的分子与外界环境交换着物质、能量和信息，参与其中的反应数达百万级。饥饿、饱腹感、寒冷以及生物体大致上所经历的所有状态都赖于这种被称为新陈代谢反应的集合。而通过一系列中间步骤将一个分子转化为另一个分子的反应链则被称为代谢途径。然而，细胞中的反应很少遵循有序序列的模式。例如，反应终端的分子经常会与开端处的分子相互作用以终止反应。这种反馈过程就闭合了反应链中的一环。所有这般路径的集合就产生了复杂的代谢网络。

因此，生物体是几层网络共同作用的结果，而不仅仅是简单基因序列的決定性结果。基因组学中已经加入了表观基因组学、转录组学、蛋白质组学、代谢组学等研究相关层级的学科，这通常被称作组学革命。而网络正是这场革命的核心。

### 3.2 Thinking webs

The idea that the soul could be embodied in an organ sounded a weird supposition by the 18th century. But physicians were aware that a stroke or other brain injuries could compromise crucial cognitive functions: the link between mind and brain was then starting to become evident. At that time, the anatomist Franz Joseph Gall dared to propose that all mental functions must arise from the brain. He identified [27]「organs」within the brain, each one responsible for colour, sound, memory, speech, as well as friendship, benevolence, pride, etc. The idea sounded so heretical that Gall had to flee Vienna and find shelter in revolutionary France.

Later on, several physiologists tried to verify Gall’s theory, for example by removing slices from pigeons’ brains. However, they could not find any evidence of the organs that Gall postulated. For this reason, they arrived at the conclusion that the brain was a homogeneous, undifferentiated unity that generated thought:「the brain secretes thought as the liver secretes bile,」as one of them put it. This conception dominated until the studies of Paul Broca in the 1860s. In autopsies of patients with expressive aphasia, Broca always found some damage to the frontal lobes of the left side of the brain. We speak with the left hemisphere, he declared, after having identified what is now called Broca’s area. Since then, neurologists have found various centres responsible for different activities, but they have also found that they rarely work in isolation: the integration of different areas of the brain is crucial to its functioning.

Networks provide a bridge between the paradigms of a brain divided into specialized areas versus the model of the brain as a whole (not dissimilar to what happens in social sciences, where networks allow us to describe society at a level they did not know the recipient, scca between individuals and communities). The brain is full of networks where various web-like structures provide the integration between specialized areas. In the cerebellum, neurons form modules that are repeated again and again: the interaction between modules is restricted to neighbours, similarly to what happens in a lattice. In other areas of the brain, we find random connections, with a more or less equal probability of connecting local, intermediate, or distant neurons. Finally, the neocortex — the region involved in many of the higher functions of mammals — combines local structures with more random, long-range connections. Some scientists think that these wiring schemes may be responsible for subjective awareness: the emerging conscience may be the result of a sufficiently complex network structure.

Pinning down the actual structure of these neuronal networks is extremely hard, due to the enormous quantity of cells and the difficulty of probing them. Only for very simple organisms such as the nematode worm, Caenorabditis elegans, we have a detailed map. This one-millimetre long, transparent creature, with a three-week lifespan, has only about 300 neurons but it is a superstar in molecular biology. Caenorabditis elegans is a model organism, an animal that is especially suitable for experiments, because scientists know its features well, and some aspects of it are comparable to those of the human organism. This translucent worm is often the first benchmark for the trial of new medicines and treatments.

Drawing a similar neuronal network for the human brain is impossible at the moment. However, another strategy can be applied. When humans perform an action, even one as simple as blinking, a storm of electrical signals from the neurons breaks out in several areas of the brain. These regions can be identified through techniques such as functional magnetic resonance. Through this technique, scientists have discovered that different areas emit correlated signals. That is, they show a special synchronization that suggests that they may influence each other. These areas can be taken as nodes and an edge is drawn between two of them if there is a sufficient level of correlation. Also at this level, the brain appears as a set of connected elements. Each action of a person lights up a network of connected areas in their brain.

思维之网

直到 18 世纪，「灵魂」可以体现在某个器官中都是一个奇怪的设想。但是，医生已经意识到中风或者其他脑损伤可能会危及关键的认知功能 一一 心与脑之间的关联从那时开始变得明显起来。当时，解剖学家弗朗茨·约瑟夫·加尔便敢于提出所有心理官能必然起源于大脑这种想法。他确定了大脑中的 [27]「器官」，每个器官分别负责颜色、声音、记忆、言语，以及友谊、仁慈、骄做等等。这种想法听起来如此异类，以至于加尔不得不逃离维也纳，进而在激进的法国找寻避难所。

后来，几位生理学家试图通过比如从鸽子的大脑中去除切片这样的方式验证加尔的理论。然而，他们并未找到加尔所设想的器官存在的任何证据。因此，他们得出结论说，大脑是产生思想的一个均匀、未经分化的统一体：如其中一位生理学家所说，「大脑分泌思想就像肝脏分泌胆汁一样」。这种观念在 1860 年代保罗·布罗卡的研究出来之前一直占据主导地位。在表达性失语症患者的尸体解剖中，布罗卡总能在他们大脑左的额叶区域发现一些损伤。在确定了人们现在称其为布罗卡区域的大脑部分之后，他便宣称，「我们用左脑说话」。从那时起，神经学家找到了负责不同活动的多个功能中心，但他们也发现这些中心区域绝少孤立运转：大脑不同区域的整合对其功能而言至关重要。

网络在被划分为专门领域的大脑模式和作为整体的大脑模式之间架起了桥梁（这与社会科学的情并无不同，在这个领域中，网络允许我们从个人和共同体之间的某个层面描述社会）。大脑中遍布网络，其中的各种网状结构在专门的区域之间提供了整合。在小脑中，神经元形成了一个个不断重复的模块：它们的相互作用被限制在了相邻的模块之间，这与晶格中发生的事情类似。而在大脑的其他区域，我们发现了随机连接现象，即局部、居间或者通远神经元之间的连接概率大致相等。最后，新皮质 —— 哺乳动物的许多高级功能所涉及的区域 —— 则将局部结构与更加随机且遥远的连接相结合。一些科学家认为这些线路体系可能负责主体意识：涌现的良知便可能是某种足够复杂的网络结构作用的结果。

确定这些神经网络的实际结构十分困难，因为细胞数量巨大，并且探測它们困难重重。我们仅掌握了那些十分简单的生物的详细神经网络图，比如一种名为秀丽隐杆线虫的寄生线虫。这种一毫米长的透明生物能存活三周，它仅有 300 个神经元，却是分子生物学界的超级明星。秀丽隐杆线虫是一种模式生物，即特别适于实验的生物，因为科学家对其特征了如指掌，且它在某些方面与人体类似。这种半透明的蠕虫通常是新药和新疗法实验的第一个基准。

目前，人们还不可能为人类大脑绘制类似的神经网络。然而，我们可以使用另外一种策略。当人们执行一个动作，即便简单如眨眼，来自神经元的电信号风暴就会在大脑中的数个区域爆发。这些区域可以通过诸如功能性磁共振这样的技术加以确认。通过这种技术，科学家发现不同的区域会发出相互关联的信号。也就是说，它们显示出某种特殊的同步现象，这表明它们可能相互影响。可将这些区域视为节点，而如果它们之间存在足够的相关性，则它们两两之间便可画上ー条边。同样在这个层次上，大脑表现为相互连接的元素集合。人的每个动作都会点亮脑中的某个连接区域。

### 3.3 The blood vessels of Gaia

In 1999, San Francisco Bay experienced massive algal blooms. Normally, such blooms are the result of an intensive agricultural use of land: when we drain fertilizers such as nitrogen and phosphorus into the sea, they become nutrients for algae. However, this was not the case in this instance, since a number of policies and controls had decreased the level of nutrient pollution entering the bay from its various rivers. 

Compiling data from three decades of observations, ecologists in California concluded that the blooms had a much more complicated explanation. In 1997 and 1998, one of the strongest El Niño events was recorded, followed by an equally strong La Niña in 1999. These phenomena induced changes in the California current system. Deep, cold, and nutrientladen waters emerged along the coast. Such nutrients attracted ocean dwellers — flatfish and crustacean — into the bay. These animals are predators of bivalves of the bay that, in turn, act as an obstacle to the spreading of algae. The collapse in the bivalve population due to the increase in its predator was the immediate cause of the algal blooms. The conditions that triggered this domino effect may be due to normal climatic fluctuations. Nevertheless, its consequences are a warning: climate change, and especially the increased frequency of extreme events, can have rather they did not know the recipient, sccaunexpected effects on ecosystems.

The central structure behind the San Francisco Bay algal bloom is a food chain —  that is, a series of species in connection: flatfish and crustacean prey on bivalves, and bivalves consume algae. Through food chains, living organisms extract from each other the energy and matter they need to survive (this is not the only possible interaction between species in an ecosystem: organisms can also establish mutually beneficial interactions, such as those between flowering plants and their insect pollinators). Every food chain starts with basal species, such as plants and bacteria. These do not prey on any other species and take resources directly from the environment by transforming light, minerals, and water. These resources are transferred along the food chain by successive predations. Intermediate species are organisms that are both predators and prey. And top species (at the end of the chain) are those that are not predated by anything. Food chains help us understand why fisheries collapse, as the Peruvian anchovy fishery in the seventies. After periods of massive indiscriminate fishing, the result is a dramatic reduction of predators such as cod or tuna. After this phase, fishing tends to move towards more basal species, such as anchovies. But these rapidly collapse as well. The reason is that, when large predators are removed, they are replaced by other predators downstream in the foodweb. These are often non-edible fish: without population control, they deplete the other edible basal species.

The actual picture of an ecosystem is even more complicated: typically, food chains are not isolated, but interwoven in intricate patterns, where a species belongs to several chains at the same time. For example, a specialized species may predate on only one prey (or in some cases on only a few). If the prey becomes extinct, the population of the specialized species collapses, giving rise to a set of co-extinctions. An even more complicated case is where an omnivore species predates a certain herbivore, and both eat a certain plant. A decrease in the omnivore's population does not imply that the plant thrives, because the herbivore would benefit from the decrease and consume even more plants.

As more species are taken into account, the population dynamics can become more and more complicated. This is why a more appropriate description than「foodchains」for ecosystems is the term foodwebs (Figure 5). These are networks in which nodes are species and links represent relations of predation. Links are usually directed (big fishes eat smaller ones, not the other way round). These networks provide the interchange of food, energy, and matter between species, and thus constitute the circulatory system of the biosphere. They are the blood vessels of the Earth.

盖亚的血管

1999 年，旧金山湾区经历了大规模的藻类暴发。通常，藻类的这种暴发是农业密集用地的结果：我们将氮、磷等化肥排入海中后，它们就会成为藻类的营物。然而，本案例中的情况并非如此，因为ー些政策和限制已经少了从不同河流排入海中的营养物染水平。加利福尼亚州的生态学家们通过搜集三十年的观察数据得出结论说，藻类暴发有着复杂得多的原因。1997 年和 1998 年，人们记录到了最强的「厄尔尼诺」现象之ー，紧随其后的便是 1999 年同样强大的「拉尼娜」现象。这些现象导致了当时加利福尼亚生态系统的变化。深海处冰冷的富营养化海水涌至海岸。这些营养物质吸引了海洋中的生物 一一 鲽鱼和甲売类动物 一一 进入湾区。这些动物是湾区双売类动物的捕食者，而后者反而是藻类蔓延的障碍。双壳类动物由于捕食者的 [27] 增加而种群崩溃，这成为藻类暴发的直接原因。触发这种多米诺效应的条件可能来自正常的气候波动。然而，其后果对人类而言却是一种警告：气候变化，特别是极端气候的频率增加，可能对生态系统产生意想不到的影响。

旧金山湾区海藻暴发背后的核心结构是食物链 一一 一系列物种的连接：鲽鱼和甲壳类动物捕食双売类动物，双売类动物消耗藻类。生物以食物链的方式从彼此身上提取他们生存所需的能量和物质（这并非生态系内物种之间唯一可能的相互作用：生物体也可以建立互利的相互作用，比如开花植物与其授粉昆虫之间的相互作用）。每个食物链都从基位物种开始，比如植物和细菌。这些物种不会捕食其他物种，它们通过转化阳光、矿物质和水而直接从环境中获取资源。这些资源以接连的捕食方式沿着食物链顺次转移。中位物种既是捕食者也是猎物。而顶位物种（处于食物链顶端）则不被任何别的物种捕食。食物链帮助我们理解为何渔业会崩溃，比如 70 年代秘鲁鲥鱼产业的境。在大规模的无差别捕鱼期之后，像鱼或金枪鱼等捕食者就会大幅少。在这个阶段之后，捕鱼业则朝着更加基位的物种进发，比如鲥鱼。但这些物种也会迅速崩溃。原因在于，当大型捕食者被移出食物链之后，食物网下游的其他捕食者便会取而代之。后者往往是不可食用的鱼类：它们的种群没了限制之后，便会耗尽其他可食用的基位物种。

生态系的实际情况甚至更为复杂：通常，食物链并不孤立存在，而是以复杂的模式彼此交织，其中的某个物种会同时属于多个食物链。例如，一个特化物种可能只捕食一种猎物（或者在一些情下仅捕食少数物种）。如果猎物灭绝，这个特定物种的种群就会崩溃，并导致一系列的共同灭绝。更加复杂的情况是，杂食动物捕食某种食草动物，而两者都吃某种植物。杂食动物种群的减少并不意味着植物的繁茂，因为食草动物将从这种物种減少中受益，进而消耗更多的植物。

图 5 英国某草原食物网：节点代表英格兰和威尔士一些草地中的物种，连线则由捕食者（较粗的一端）指向猎物（细的一端）

将更多的物种纳入考虑范围，种群动力机制会变得越发复杂。这便是为何对生态系統而言，食物网（图 5）是比「食物链」更为恰当的描述。这些网络中的节点是物种，连线表示它们之间的捕食关系。连线通常是有向的（大鱼吃小鱼，而非相反）。这些网络提供了物种之间的食物、能量和物质交换并因此构成了生物圈的循环系統。它们构成了地球的血管。

### 3.4 Homo retiarius(Net man)

Word of mouth is a common way to obtain information about white-collar job openings. So if we are looking for this kind of job, it is a good idea to spread the word between friends and relatives. Less obviously, it may be even better to inform distant acquaintances and people we do not see often. This is what Mark Granovetter suggested in 1973 and now represents a wide variety of topics in history, philosophy, religion, science, and the humanities. This sociologist interviewed a sample of professionals in a Boston suburb who had recently relied on personal contacts to obtain their jobs. He asked them how often they saw the person before obtaining the job. The majority reported ‘occasionally’ and a significant fraction answered ‘rarely’. Job offers are more likely to come from old college friends, past workmates, and previous employers, than from close friends. Chance or mutual friends were the channels by which these connections were rediscovered. Granovetter described this phenomenon as the strength of weak ties.

He explained this result by depicting the circle of acquaintances of a hypothetical individual called Ego. Ego lives every day with his family and some close friends. Probably all these persons are also in close contact with each other. As a result, information travels fast in the group. So Ego is likely aware of all the news available in the group. On the contrary, weak ties connect him to faraway people. These individuals are not bounded by Ego’s social surroundings. Therefore they open a whole set of new groups to him, each of them encapsulating information otherwise inaccessible. Missing the opportunity of weak ties causes difficulties in organizations, companies, or institutions. Information and skills become trapped in one group, without reaching those who need them. So these things have to be reinvented or paid for from outside consultants. A former CEO of HP is reported to have lamented:「If HP only knew what HP knows!」

Granovetter’s intuition was later developed into the theory of social capital. This idea implies that the contacts of one person (and the contacts of these contacts) enable him or her to access resources that ultimately provide such things as better jobs and faster promotions. More generally, the position of an individual in his or her social network is crucial to determine future opportunities, constraints, outcomes, etc.

Measuring acquaintance is not easy, since it is such a subjective issue. Usually, maps such as the flowchart of a company are not very useful, because they do not correspond to the actual relations between workers. For this reason they are useless in helping us understand the channels (and possible bottlenecks) of information within the company. Scientists have devised a large set of alternative strategies to draw social networks, ranging from questionnaires to snowball sampling, a system in which an interviewed subject suggests somebody in their circle for the next interview. These strategies have enabled the collection of data as sensitive as the map of sexual intercourse between groups of different individuals (from high-school students in the US Midwest to people living in a village of Burkina Faso): the knowledge of these networks allows for better understanding of the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.

Another kind of relation that is relatively easy to pin down is professional collaboration. Such networks exist in several fields, ranging from Hollywood (two actors become connected if they play in the same movie) to science (two scientists become linked if they write a paper together). Collaborations can be found in more exotic environments such as politics (US senators have been connected on the basis of the co-sponsorship of laws) or terrorism (activists are connected on the basis of intelligence reports and legal documents).

Information technology provides a new and powerful way to measure interaction between people. Frequent phone calls and emails between two individuals, or friendship in virtual social networks like Facebook or LinkedIn, indicate a stable relationship and therefore an edge. More and more companies exploit the social networks of their customers to find su steps away (friends of friendsttguch information. For example, telephone companies are reported to target「influential」individuals with offers and other strategies: these are the customers who, when they change company, trigger similar changes in their close connections.

人类「角斗士」（网络人）

口口相传（word of mouth）是获得有关白领职位空缺信息的惯常方式。所以，如果我们正在寻找这种工作，在亲友之间传递相关信息则不啻为一个好主意。不那么明显的是，我们将信息告知远方不常见面的熟人甚至会有更好的效果。这便是马克·格兰诺维特于 1973 年提出的观点。这位社会学家采访了波士顿郊区职业人士这一样本，他们当时都依靠个人联系获得了各自的工作。格兰诺维特问他们在获得工作之前与提供工作的人的联系频率。多数人的答复是「偶尔」，许多人的回答是「绝少」。与亲密的朋友相比，工作机会更可能来自旧时的校友、过去的同事和以前的雇主。运气或共同的朋友则是再现这些联系的管道。格兰诺维特将这种现象描述为弱连带优势。

1『这里又看见格兰若维特的「弱关系」理论。弱关系对应于纵向的异质交互。（2021-02-09）』

格兰诺维特通过描述一位假想中的名为埃戈的人的熟人来解释这种结果。埃戈每天都和家人及一些亲密的朋友生活在一起。所有这些人很可能也彼此联系紧密。其结果便是，信息会在这群人中快速传播。因此，埃戈可能知道这群人中的所有新鲜事。与此相反，较弱的人际联系也会将他与遥远的人联系起来。这些人并不会受到埃戈社交环境的限制。因此，他们向他开放了一组新的群体集合，每一群人都封装着别的群体无法获取的信息。弱联系的缺失会为组织、公司或机构带来各种困难。信息和技术被限制在一个群体之内，而没有抵达那些需要它们的人手中。因此，这些东西需被重新创造或从外部顾问处有偿获得。据报道，惠普的前首席执行官曾感叹道：「惠普不能闭目塞听！」格兰诺维特的直觉后来发展成为社会资本理论。

这种想法意味着一个人的联系人（以及这些联系人的联系人）使他或她能够获取那些最终可以提供更好工作和更快升迁的资源。更普遍的是，个人在他或她的社交网络中的位置对于定其未来的机会、限制和成果而言至关重要。

衡量交情并不容易，因为它是十分主观的事情。通常，像公司流程图之类的图谱并不是很有用，因为它们并不对应着员工之间的实际关系。正因为如此，流程图并不能帮助我们了解公司内部的信息渠道（以及可能的瓶颈）。科学家们设计了大量的替代策略来绘制社交网络，从问卷调查到雪球式抽样，即系统中的每个受访者都推荐自己圏子里的某人为下一个采访对象。这些策略使得数据的搜集就像不同个体（从美国中西部的高中生到非洲布基纳法索的村民）所组成的群体之间的性行为图那般敏感：有关这些关系网络的知识能让人们更好地理解性传擂疾病的蔓延。

另外一种相对容易定义的关系则是专业协作。这样的网络存在于多个领域，从好坞（如果两个演员出演同一部电影，他们便会产生联系）到科学领域（如果两位科学家共同撰写一篇论文，他们也会产生联系）。合作还能在更不寻常的环境中找到，比如政治（美国参议员会在支持共同法律的基础上生联系）或者恐怖主义活动（恐佈分子则基于情报和法律文件相互联系）中。

信息技术为衡量人际互动提供了一种强大的新手段。两人之间频繁的电话和邮件往来，或者在脸书、领英等虚拟社交网络中的友谊等，都表明了一种稳定的关系和网络图中的一条边。越来越多的公司利用他们客户的社交网络来找寻这样的信息。例如，据报道，电话公司会以提供工作机会或别的策略来瞄准「有影响力」的个人：当这些客户改换公司的时候，就会在他们的密切联系人中触发类似的变化。

### 3.5 Webs of Words, Webs of Ideas

What shall King Henry be a pupil still / Under the surly Gloucester’s governance?

says Queen Margaret in Part II of Shakespeare’s King Henry VI trilogy (Act I, Scene III). The queen complains about the influence of the duke of Gloucester on her husband, the king. What does she mean by「pupil」? A thesaurus suggests that pupil can be rephrased as scholar, acolyte, adherent, convert, disciple, epigone, liege man, partisan, votarist, or votary. This list provides a full spectrum of words to denote one person subjected to another. We can enlarge the spectrum by exploring all the words related to「pupil」that is, its semantic area. These include faithful, loyalist, advocate, backer, supporter, satellite, yes-man … What role does the queen desire for her husband? Antonyms of「pupil」suggest non-student, coryphaeus, leader, apostate, defector, renegade, traitor, and turncoat. Naturally, she is asking King Henry to rebel against the authority of the duke of Gloucester.

This is a simple example of how words link to each other. Indeed, a rigorous analysis should take into account the historical differences in the use of a word, the specific occurrence of a term in Shakespeare’s work, the context in which it is used in the script, and many other aspects. In any case, it is fair to say that we can better understand the meaning of a word if we take into account its「neighbours」in language. Synonimity, antonymity, and semantic connection are just a few of the possible relations. Others are meronymity and hypernimity (‘beer’ is a meronym of ‘drink’ and the latter is a hypernym of the former). ‘Pupil’ provides a crystalclear example of another kind of connection. This term has two completely different meanings: it indicates both a student and a part of the eye. It is a case of polysemy. Of course, the context of Shakespeare’s dramas immediately determines the correct meaning. In general, context provides the exact meaning of words: the co-occurrence of words in sentences defines their meaning. Such a co-occurrence provides yet another relation between words. For example, the words ‘king’ and ‘Henry’ are much more likely to appear together in English sentences than ‘king’ and relativity, for example.

We can now create our own maps of language. We use words as vertices and the edges connect synonyms, antonyms, and polysemic words (these relations can be drawn from a thesasurus or a dictionary, while patterns of co-occurrence can be drawn from large language databases, such as the British National Corpus). Semantic connections are more difficult to pin down: their study forms a complete area of linguistics. Some languages have special dictionaries that associate one word with a set of related ones. An alternative approach is experimental word association. A word is provided to a sample of people, asking them to say the first word that comes into their mind after hearing it. The resulting words are then used to repeat the association experiment. Proceeding in this way, step by step we build our web of associations. Different instances of word networks display different results. These depend on the language, on the kind of text, on the education of the author of the text, or may be related to linguistic dysfunctions. 

Archaeology Word networks contain a lot of information, but usually they are not particularly useful in studying the actual content of the texts and the relations between the ideas expressed in different texts. This is a crucial issue for web queries, for example. Usually, complicated algorithms have to be implemented to perform this task. However, in some bodies of texts, a very precise network can be drawn. This is the case with scientific literature. Producing knowledge is never a solitary endeavour. A scientist is always「a dwarf standing on the shoulders of a giant,」as philosopher Bernard of Chartres is said to have pointed out for the first time in the 12th century. Scientists’ work almost always builds on previous results. Researchers recognize this by citing several older publications at the end of their papers. Citations provide recognition of relevant results of the past, give credibility to new results and make reference to facts, technologies, and experiments that are accepted as valid, or criticized, within a work. Publications have been extensively standardized in recent years: articles are mostly in English, control methods have been homogenized (mainly through peer review), measures of impact have been devised, etc. At the same time, large electronic databases of publications have been established, with thousands of new items being added every day: articles, books, patents, projects, etc. All this produces a large network of publications: two items are connected if one of them cites the other. We can also identify authorship from these databases and create networks of collaborations between scientists. These systems are increasingly used to map and visualize the development of knowledge and the most active areas of science.

语词之网，思想之网

玛格莱特王后在莎翁的《亨利六世》三部曲的中篇（第一幕，第三场）里说道：「难道说，亨利王上老要在乖戾的葛罗斯特管辖之下当小学生吗？」[1] 王后抱怨葛罗斯特公爵对其国王丈夫的影响。她用「小学生」（pupil）表达的是什么意思？分类词典表明，「pupi 还可以表述为 scholar（学者） acolyte（助手）、adherent（信徒）、convert（皈依者）、disciple（门徒）、epigone（追随者）、liege man（臣下）、partisan（党羽）、votarist（拥护者）或者 votary（崇拜者）等等。这个清单为「ー个人从属于另外一个人」这项语义提供了一幅全景语词图谱。我们可以通过探索与「pupil 相关的语词即其语义区来扩展这一图谱。其他的语词包括 faithful（信徒）、loyalist（忠诚者）、advocate（倡导者）、backer（赞助者）、supporter（支持者）、satellite（随从）、yes-man（唯唯诺诺之人）。

那么，王后意欲用何种意义指谓其夫君呢？pupi 的反义词表示 non- student（非学生） coryphaeus（领导者）、leader（首领）、apostate（变节者）、defector（背叛者）、renegade（叛徒）、traitor（背信弃义之人）以及 turncoat（叛贼）等。当然，她在要求亨利国王反对葛罗斯特公爵的权威。

这是语词之间如何相互联系的一个简单例子。事实上，严格的分析应该将语词使用的历史差异、莎士比亚作品中某个语词的特定出现、它在剧本中使用的语境，以及其他诸多方面都考虑进来。公平地讲，在任何情况下，我们都可以更好地理解语词的含义，若我们将其在语言中的「邻居」考虑进来的话。同义、反义以及语义联系仅仅是语词间少数几种可能的联系。其他则包括整体部分关系和上下位关系等（「啤酒」是「料」的一部分，后者则是前者的上位词）。「pupi」为语词间的另一种联系提供了清晰明了的例子。这个语词有着然不同的两种含义：它表示学生，也表示眼的一部分。这便是一词多义的情景。自然，莎翁的戏剧语境当下就决定了其正确的含义。一般来说，上下文提供了语词的具体含义：句子中语词的共现定义了它们自身的含义。如比的共现提供了语词的另外一种关系。例如，语词「国王」和「亨利」在英语句子中就比「国王」和「相对论」一起出现的可能性要大得多。

我们现在可以创建自己的语言地图。我们用语词作为顶点，同义词、反义词和多义词（这些语词关系可按照分类词典或一般词典绘制，而共现的模式则可从大型语言数据库中获取，比如英国国家语料库）则由边来连接。语义联系更加难以确定对它们的研究构成了一个完整的语言学领域。一些语言具备将一个语词与一组相关语词联系起来的特殊词典。另外一个替代方案便是词汇联想实验。一个语词被提供给样本中的一群人，要求他们说出听到这个语词之后想到的第一个语词。得出的语词接着又被用来重复这个联想实验。以这种方式，我们可以一步步建立自己的语词联系之网。语词网络的不同实例代表了不同的结果。这取決于语言本身、文本的类型、文本作者所受的教育，或许它与语言功能障碍也关系。

语词网络包含大量信息，但通常，这些信息在研究文本的具体内容和不同文本所表达的思想之间的关系时并不是特別有用。这是一个关键问题，比如对网络查询来说，通常，人们必须引入复杂的算法来执行该任务。然而，在一些文本中，人们可以绘制十分精确的网络。科学文献中即是如此。生产知识从来不是单个人的努力。如哲学家沙特尔的伯纳德在 12 世纪首次指出的那样，科学家总是「站在巨人肩膀上的矮子」。科学家的工作几乎总是建立在先前的结果之上。研究者们认识到了这一点，他们会在其论文未尾引用一些较早的出版物。引用提供了对过往相关成果的认可，赋予新的成果以可信度，并参考那些在某项研究中被接纳为有效或被批判过的事实、技术和实验。近年来，出版物在很大程度上实现了标准化：文章大多以英文写成，控制方法已经同质化（主要以同行评议的方式），文章影响力的衡量标准也已制定等。同时，出版物的大型电子数据库业已建立，其中每天都会增加上千个新项目文章、书籍、专利和工程等等。所有这些生成了个大型的出版网络：如果一个项目引用另外一个，则它们相互关联。我们还可从这些数据库中识别作者身份，并创建科学家之间的协作网络。人们越来越多地利用这些系统绘制知识发展和科学最活跃领域的图景，并将其可视化。

### 3.6 Money by Wire

In 2008 a number of large financial institutions in the United States suddenly went bankrupt. In a few months, the majority of the developed world was involved in one of the largest financial crises ever seen. Much has been written on the causes of this crisis. What is certain is that it showed that economies are very tightly interconnected at a global level.

Classical economic theories represented economic actors as independent, completely rational agents, focused on maximizing their income. However, facts show that individuals, companies, institutions, and countries are not independent: everyone influences each other in many ways. Their behaviour, far from being completely rational, is strongly dependent on subjectivity, emotions, and reciprocal influence.

Lending money is one way in which companies and institutions can become tightly interconnected. An interesting case is the money exchanged on a daily basis between private banks so that it can be available to meet the possible requests of bank clients (becoming therefore more liquid). If customer requests should exceed the liquidity reserve of a bank, that bank can ask other banks to lend money. Central banks worldwide require other banks to place a part of their deposits and debts with them, to create a buffer against liquidity shortages. In this sense, central banks ensure the stability of the banking system, thus avoiding liquidity shocks. The freezing of the interbank lending network was one of the first signals of the 2008 financial crisis.

An even stronger relation than lending money is given by shareholding, i.e. the direct participation of a company in another company's capital. This means that the first company holds a part of the second one, and can exert influence on its main decisions. Shareholding is converted into control when a company holds the majority of stock, or when it is able to determine the vote of the majority of the board. In this case they did not know the recipient, scca, legally independent companies are converted into a business group. Often, these groups display a pyramidal structure, where a holding company is at the top, and operating companies are at the bottom of the control hierarchy.

The existence of business groups is explicit and legally regulated in most countries; but softer and less regulated forms of influence can exist. The most common of these happens within boards. Managers often sit on many boards at the same time. Obviously, they act as channels of information, alliances, or interests between boards. Their simultaneous presence in different boards establishes an interlock between their companies. If the companies are explicit competitors, this situation is clearly incompatible with a free market. A shared director will either favour one of the companies against the other or establish a cartel between them (which is generally ruled out by law). In general, such a director will find it very difficult to operate in the interest of all the investors in the different companies.

Further evidence of interconnectedness between companies is given by stock price correlations. Finance practitioners know that the stocks of companies operating in the same sector (e.g. mining, transport, services, food, etc.) change their prices in a somehow similar or「synchronized」fashion. For example, stock prices of all the companies within the electronic sector (or any other) tend to decrease or increase at the same time. Financial analysts are interested in knowing how much of the change in a stock price is influenced by the change of another stock (in short, they want to know the correlation between stock prices). If this connection is strong enough, it is likely that the two companies are somehow connected. Lending money, shareholdings, shared directors, or stock price correlations are the main criteria by which a network between companies can be built: edges are drawn when one of these situations occurs.

The interconnectedness goes far beyond companies within one specific market. As the financial crisis has shown, events rapidly spread from national markets into the global scenario. One obvious channel by which this can happen is the import/export trade relationships among countries. This world trade web is a network in which nodes are countries and their trade relations define the edges. Like the cell, economies depend on these multiple layers of networks.

互联的货币

2008 年，美国的一些大型金融机构突然破产。几个月的时间里，大多数发达国家都卷入了这场史上最严重的金融危机之一。关于这场危机的原因已经有过很多分析了。可以肯定的是，它表明经济在全球层面的相互关联已十分紧密。

古典经济理论将经济参与者表示为独立、完全理性的行为者，他们专注于最大化自己的收入。然而，事实表明个人、公司、机构和国家并非相互独立：每一方都以多种方式彼此影响着。他们的行为远非完全理性，而是强烈地依赖于主观态度、情感和相互影响。

货款是公司和机构能够紧密互联的方式之ー。一个有趣的例子是私人银行间日常会进行货币交换，以便能够满足银行客户的可能要求（因此变得更具流动性）。如果客户的要求超过了某银行的流动性储备，该银行可以向其他银行借款。世界各地的中央银行会要求其他银行将其存款和债务的一部分置于它们那里，以创造一个应对流动性不足的缓冲器。在这个意义上，中央银行确保了银行系统的稳定性，从而避免了流动性冲击。同业拆借网络的冻结是 2008 年金融危机的最初信号之ー。

与货款相比，持股，即某公司资本直接加入到另一个公司中，能够带来甚至更加紧密的联系。这意味着一家公司持有第二家公司的一部分，并能对其主要決策施加影响。当某公司持有大部分股票，或当它能够決定事会多数成员的投票时，持股就转变为控股。在这种情下，法律上独立的公司便转化为商业集团。通常，这些集团展现了某种金字塔结构，其中控股公司的权力在顶部，运作公司则处于控制层级的底部。

在大多数国家，商业集团以具体形式存在，并在法律上受到监管；但是更软性和更少规制的影响形式也可能存在。这在董事会内部最为常见。管理者经常同时在多个公司的董事会任职。显然，他们扮演着董事会之间信息、联盟或者利益的交换渠道。他们在不同董事会中的同时任职为相关公司之间建立了连锁关系。如果这些公司是明确的竟争者关系，这种情况则明显与自由市场不兼容。共同的董事要么支持其中一个公司而打压另一个，要么在公司之间建立垄断联盟（这通常会被法律排除掉）。一般而言，这样的董事会发现自己身陷来自不同公司的投资者之间的利益纠缠之中而难以运作。

公司之间相互关联的进一步证据来自股票价格的相关性。财务人员知道在同一行业（例如采矿、运输、服务、食品等）经营的公司的股票会以某种类似或「同步」的方式改变价格。例如，电子行业（或任何其他行业）内所有公司的股票价格往往同时降低或升高。金融分析师则有兴趣知晓某只股票的价格变动在何种程度上受另ー只股票价格变动的影响（总之，他们想知道股票价格之间的相关性）。如果这种联系足够强，则很可能这两个公司以某种方式相互关联着。货款、持股、共享董事或股票价格的相关性是公司之间能够建立网络的主要标准：当出现这些情况之一时，则绘出网络图中的边。

互联互通远远超出了某个特定市场中的公司。正如金融危机所展现的，事件会迅速地从国家市场范围扩展为全球局面。这种情况能够发生的一个明显途径是国家之间的进出口贸易关系。这种世界贸易网是一种以国家为节点，以贸易关系为边的网络。就像细胞一样，经济依赖于这些网络的多层结构。

### 3.7 Critical Infrastructures

On the night of 28 September 2003, lights went out across the whole of Italy, with the single exception of the island of Sardinia. It took several hours, in some places even days, to reinstate normal supply. Investigation showed that the blackout was triggered by a tree flashover close to a high-tension line between Italy and Switzerland. The resulting shortage of electric supply caused a sharp increase in demand on the remaining lines. As a result those lines collapsed, generating a ripple effect through the entire system.

Large-scale power outages reveal the connectedness of power grids. These systems deliver electricity across large distances from central points to cities and industrial areas. Carefully planned in the beginning, they grow more and more intricate over time. Nowadays, generators, transformers, and substations, connected by high-voltage transmission lines, constitute a network that spans several regions and often several countries (as the 2003 example shows). It is clear that such networks require careful maintenance to prevent criticalities.

Similar instabilities appear in a variety of other infrastructures. Communication systems, such as the telephone network, are one example. But probably the most sensitive is the transportation network: streets, highways, and railways connecting cities, the web of boats transporting fuel and other goods, and above all the airport web. Planes transport billions of passengers and tonnes of goods every year. A minimal malfunction in such an infrastructure has major consequences: Eurocontrol (the European organization for the safety of air navigation) has estimated that delays in flights cost European countries up to €200 billion in 1999 alone. In a globalized world, transportation networks are similar to circulatory systems in living beings.

关键的基础设施

2003 年 9 月 28 日晚，整个意大利的灯火都熄灭了，唯一的例外是撒丁岛。恢复正常供电耗费了数小时，有些地方甚至花费了数天时间。调查发现，这场停电由发生在意大利与瑞士之间高压线路邻近处的树木闪燃引发。由此造成的供电不足导致人们对剩余线路的供电需求猛增。结果，这些线路崩溃了，并在整个电力系统中产生了某种涟漪效应。

大规模的停电掲示了电网的连通性。这些系统跨越很远的距离将电力从中心点传输至城市和工业区域。一开始的电网规划很周密，这些电网随着时间的推移而越发复杂。如今，由高压输电线路连接的发电机、变压器和变电站组成的电力网络跨越数个地区，通常是数个国家（正如 2003 年的例子所展现的那般）。很明显，这种网络需要仔细维护以防止危急情况。

类似的不稳定性出现在各种其他基础设施中。电话网络这样的通信系统便是一例。但可能最敏感的是交通网络：街道、高速公路和连接城市的铁路，运输燃料和其他货物的船只网络，最重要的则是机场网络。飞机每年运输数十亿乘客以及成吨的货物。这种基础设施中的一次微小故障都会产生重大后果：据欧洲空中航行安全组织估计，航班延误给欧洲国家造成的损失仅在 1999 年就高达 2000 亿欧元。在全球化的世界中，交通网络的作用类似于生物体内的循环系统。

### 3.8 A net as Large as the World

In October 1969, a message travelled for the first time from one computer to another, through a telephone line. Two university labs in California were at the ends of the line. After a few letters, the message broke down, but the connection was established: Arpanet, the grandfather of the Internet, was born. The idea of a network of computers was around during the previous decade. At the end of the fifties, ARPA (the US Advanced Research Project Agency) asked engineer Paul Baran to design a communication structure able to resist an attack. In particular, the whole system had to continue working even under an attack destroying part of it. Baran duly designed a distributed system with such characteristics — but a change in strategy locked his pioneering studies into a drawer. However, in the sixties, some universities asked ARPA to finance a similar project for different purposes. The academic institutions were keen to interconnect their computers in order to aggregate their computational power.

The 1969 Arpanet connected UCLA (University of California Los Angeles) and the SRI (Stanford Research Institute). Two years later, the number of nodes was over forty, including some companies and other universities. This structure was so successful that in the seventies similar networks appeared in other parts of the world, created by particle physicists, astronomers, companies: Hepnet, Span, Telenet, etc. If at the beginning the problem was to connect the computers, this moved on how to connect networks. Internetworking became the motto of many computer scientists. At the end of the seventies, engineer Robert Kahn and mathematician Vinton Cerf developed the TCP/IP: whatever the internal structure of networks, this software allows them to talk to each other. This code was put in the public domain and based on the concept of open architecture. Finally, in the eighties, the TCP/IP transition was fully achieved, bringing to creation the Internet, the ‘network of networks’.

Such a structure is probably the human artefact that best embodies the idea of networks. A computer connected to the Internet becomes one of many hosts. If we want to deliver an email to a specific place, we do not need to be directly connected with that destination. From origin to our target, information travels along routers, devices responsible for transmitting packets of data. A large series of connections keeps the structure linked: optical fibres, telephone lines, satellite connections, etc. Since nobody plans where hosts and connections are added, the overall structure of the Internet is not recorded. Actually, mapping at host level is practically impossible. We can have a rough representation of it only at router level. In this case, the nodes of these networks are the routers, and the edges are their connections. We can coarse-grain the structure even more, grouping routers into autonomous systems. These groups are autonomously administrated domains that usually correspond to Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and other organizations.

The great success of the Internet is due to the exceptional experience it provides. Watching television is a one-direction, one-medium, passive experience. The Internet is not so. People can navigate an infinite series of documents, use different media, exchange information, and talk to each other. Unlike traditional communication technologies such as telephone, radio, or television, the Internet does not have a specific purpose. Rather, it is a mutant artefact able to host infinite applications. Actually, the Internet is only a physical infrastructure that supports services. One of the most successful of these is the World Wide Web (WWW). This is an enormous set of electronic documents recorded in the devices that make up the Internet and connected by hyperlinks that allow navigation between them. The pattern is somewhat similar to the body of scientific literature, made of articles, books, patents, etc. connected by citations.

The idea of the WWW was born at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research). Physicist Tim Berners-Lee (later joined by computer scientist Robert Cailliau) put forward the proposal for it in 1989. Berners-Lee designed a system that allowed scientists to access, through their own computers, the enormous amount of data produced by particle physics experiments. The software to make this system work was not patented but rather released in the public domain. This decision — as in the case of TCP/IP — proved to be very significant. Right from the beginning, thousands (and then even greater numbers) of users tried it, improved it, and created web pages and services. In just a few years, the Web became World Wide. Its magnitude is unknown, since none of the search engines that explore the web (such as Google or Yahoo!) is able to archive all web pages. After all, this would make little sense: several websites are capable of producing new pages upon request. A 2005 estimate put the content of the whole WWW (for static pages) as equivalent to 200 terabytes of information. At the time, this was about ten times the size of the US Congress Library. Undoubtedly today‘s figure would be greater by orders of magnitude, since the growth of the WWW is exponential.

如世界般巨大之网

1969 年 10 月，一条信息首次通过电话线从一台计算机传至另外一台。加利福尼亚州的两个大学实验室位于这条电话线的两端。几个字母的传之后，信息中断了，但连接业已建立：互联网的前身阿帕网（Arpanet）诞生了。关于计算机网络的设想在过去十年里一直都有。50 年代末，美国国防部高研究计划署（JS Advanced Research Project Agency, ARPA）要求工程师保罗·巴兰设计能够抵抗攻击的通信架构。尤其是即便在其部分正受破坏的情况下，整个系統还必须继续工作。巴兰恰当地设计了具备这种特征的分布式系统 —— 但策略上的调整使得他的开创性研究被束之高阁。然而，在 60 年代，一些大学为了其他目的而要求 ARPA 资助一个类似的项目。学术机构渴望相互连接它们的计算机，以便汇聚其计算能力。

1969 年，阿帕网连接了加州大学洛杉矶分校和斯坦福研究所。两年之后，阿帕网的节点数已超过 40 个，包括一些公司以及其他大学。这种通信架构是如此成功，以至于在 70 年代，由粒子物理学家、天文学家和一些企业创建的类似网络，如高能物理网、Span 网、远程网等纷纷出现在了世界其他地 方。如果说一开始的问题在于连接计算机，后来则转向了如何连接各种网络。网际互连成为许多计算机科学家的座右铭。70 年代末，工程师罗伯特·卡恩和数学家文顿·瑟夫开发了传输控制协议 / 互联网协议（TCP/IP）：无论何种网络内部架构，这个软件都允许它们彼此交换信息。这个代码基于开放体系结构的概念，并被应用于公共领域。最终在 80 年代，TCP/IP 转换完全实现，互联网「众网之网」由此诞生。

这一结很可能是最能体现网络思想的人工制品。一台连接到互联网的计算机即成为众多主机之一。如果要向特定地点发送电子邮件，我们并不需要直接与该目的地相互关联。从原点到我们的目标，信息沿着路由器这种负责传送数据包的设备传播。大量的连接使结构内部相互关联：光纤、电话线卫星连接等。因为没人筹划过哪里应该增加主机和连接，人们并未记录互联网的大致结构。实际上，绘制主机层面的图景是不可能的，我们只能在路由器层面对其进行大致的呈现。在这种情况下，这些网络的节点便是路由器，它们的连接就是边。我们甚至可将结构更加粗粒度化，将路由器编组至自治系统中。这些组便是自主管理的域，通常对应于互联网服务提供商和其他组织。

1『这里的「路由」可不是家里的那种路由，是外面的「大路由」，比如华为卖的路由产品。（2021-02-10）』

互联网的巨大成功在于它提供的卓越体验。观看电视乃单向、单媒体的被动体验。互联网并非如此。人们可以浏览无数的文档，使用不同的媒体，交换信息，并相互交谈。与传统的通信技术，比如电话、无线电或电视不同，互联网并没有特定的目的。相反，它是一个能够容纳无数设备的异形人工制品。实际上，互联网仅仅是一个支持各种服务的物理基础设施。其中最成功的乃是万维网（WWW）。这是一组巨大的电子文档，被记录在组成互联网的设备之中，并通过那些为它们提供导航的超链接相互关联。这种模式有些类似于由文章、书籍、专利等组成，且经引用而相互关联的科学文献整体。

万维网的想法诞生于欧洲核子研究组织。物理学家蒂姆·伯纳斯·李（计算机科学家罗伯特·卡约后来也加入进来）于 1989 年提出了这一想法。伯纳斯·李设计了ー个允许科学家们通过自己的计算机访问粒子物理实验所得出的大量数据的系统。让这一系统得以运转的软件并未申请专利，而是被公开发行。这一決定 一一 就像 TCP/IP 的例子一样 —— 被证明意义重大。从一开始，成千上万（之后甚至更多）的用户便对其进行了试用和改进，进而创建了各种网页和服务。短短几年之内，网络覆盖了整个世界。它的量级无人知晓，因为任何探索网络的搜索引擎（比如谷歌或雅虎）都无法归档所有网页。毕竟，这也没什么意义：几个网站一经请求就能生成新的页面。一项 2005 年的评估认为，整个万维网（对于静态页面而言）的内容相当于 200 太字节的信息。当时，这个数据量大约相当于 10 个美国国会图书馆。亳无疑问，如今这一数字会比之前多出若干数量级，因为万维网的信息量增长呈指数级。

### 3.9 Cyberspaces

On 11 September 2001, the infrastructures of New York City experienced a ‘network catastrophe’, parallel and related to the human tragedy that was taking place that same day. Soon after two hijacked airliners crashed into the World Trade Center complex, a surge in phone calls was registered. People were trying to communicate with friends, and rescue personnel with colleagues. Cell networks were quickly overloaded and people lined up at payphones in Manhattan. The attack damaged Verizon’s central office, interrupting 200,000 lines. AT&T infrastructures, some of them housed in the basement of the World Trade Center were destroyed as well. When calls failed, many people turned to the Internet. But wireless service was also impacted. The impact on the economy extended well beyond the crash sites. It took six days before the New York Stock Exchange could return to work. Months passed before services were restored to near pre-disaster levels.

The terrorist attacks showed that there is almost no network that stands alone. Physical and virtual infrastructures are embedded in a common cyberspace, where energy, information, transport, communication, etc. are provided. Power grids support the Internet, that hosts the WWW, that in its turn enables email services, social networks, information websites, and file-sharing systems.

赛博空间

2001 年 9 月 11 日，约市的基础设施经历了次「网络灾难」，这一灾难与当天发生的人类悲剧有关且类似。在两架被劫持的飞机撞向世贸中心大度之后不久，记录显示通话数量激增。人们试图与朋友取得联系，并与同事一道救援相关人员。手机网络很快超载，人们纷纷在曼哈顿的付费电话旁排队等。

这次袭击破坏了威瑞森的总部，切断了 20 万条线路。美国电话电报公司的基础设施，包括那些设置在世贸中心地下室的也遭到损毁。当电话呼叫失败时，许多人便求助于互联网。但无线服务也受到影响。而袭击对经济的影向则远远超出事故地之外。纽约证券交易所耗时六天才重新恢复运转各种服务直到数月之后才恢复至灾难前的水平。

这场恐怖袭击表明，几乎没有任何网络能够独立存在。物理和虚拟的基础设施已嵌入公共赛博空间（cyberspace），并在其中提供能量、信息、传输和通信等服务。电网支撑着互联网，互联网存储万维网，万维网又让邮件服务、社交网络、信息网站和文件共享系统运转起来。许多活动，包括飞行管控、银行项目、应急系统和商业服务等也依赖万维网。赛博空间中某个层面的崩溃通常会以相当不可预知的方式影响到其他层面。

多个网络的相互连接在许多其他情况下也很常见。例如，影响 2008 年经济的流动性冲击迅速蔓延至其他许多经济网络之中。类似地，社交网络也在许多方面显示出这种特征。一个有趣的例子是真实世界的友谊与虚拟社交网络的联系相比较而显示的特征：这两个网络之间有着重要的反馈机制。细胞则是微型赛博空间：基因调控网络、蛋白质相互作用网络和代谢网络之间彼此嵌套。因此，一些科学家提出将基因组、蛋白质组、代谢组等相关概念融合为相互作用组这一综合概念。最后，生态系统可被看作是相互作用的网络组。例如，对抗和共生网络都在决定物种如何繁盛方面发挥着自己的作用。在所有这些情况下，网络为解开相互交织的复杂系统提供了有用的图景。
