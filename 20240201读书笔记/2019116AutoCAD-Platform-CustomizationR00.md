### 0101. 主题卡 —— 封装判断数据类型的函数

You can use the AutoLISP type function to identify the type of data retuned by a function or assigned to a variable. The following shows the syntax of the type function:

```c
(type value)
```

value. The value argument represents any valid atom; an AutoLISP expression, a value, or a variable.

The type function returns a symbol that can be used to determine if the value returned by a function or assigned to a variable is the type of data you are expecting. The following AutoLISP expressions define a custom function named IsString, which uses the type function to determine whether a value is of the string data type:

```c
(defun IsString (val / )
  (if (= (type val) 'STR) T nil)
)
```

You can use the IsString function by entering it at the AutoCAD Command prompt or loading it as part of an AutoLISP (LSP) file. When the function is executed, it will return T if the value it is passed is a string data type or nil for all other data types. The following shows several examples of the IsString function along with the values they return:

```c
(IsString "2")
// out
T

(IsString 2)
// out
nil

(IsString PAUSE)
// out
T

(IsString PI)
// out
nil
```

### 0102. 主题卡 —— 如何获取用 entmake 函数新建一个实体对象所需的参数

For some objects it's easier to determine which properties are required; for example, a circle requires a center point and radius whereas a line requires a start and endpoint. The best way to figure out which properties are required when creating an object is to create a new object in a drawing of the type you want to create with the entmake function. Once the object is created, enter the following code at the AutoCAD Command prompt to see the entity data list associated with the object:

```c
(entget (entlast))
```

For example, if you drew a circle with a center point of 5,6.5,0 and a radius of 2.0, the entity data list that is returned might look like this:

```c
((-1. <Entity name: 7ff773005dc0>) (0. "CIRCLE")
 (330. <Entity name: 7ff7730039f0>) (5. "1D4") (100. "AcDbEntity")
 (67. 0) (410. "Model") (8. "0") (100. "AcDbCircle")
 (10 5.0 6.5 0.0) (40. 2.0) (210 0.0 0.0 1.0))
```

In the previous example, the DXF group codes –1, 5, and 330 were automatically generated and assigned to the object. Those DXF group codes shouldn't be part of the entity data list when you create a new object with the entmake function. Table 16.2 describes the DXF group codes –1, 5, and 330.

The DXF group codes 67, 410, 8, and 210 are optional; if they aren't provided as part of the entity data list, AutoCAD uses the current settings and context of the drawing to populate the values of the properties they represent. Table 16.3 describes the DXF group codes 67, 410, 8, and 210.

After removing the DXF group codes that are optional, the entity data list becomes even easier to understand:

```c
((0. "CIRCLE") (100. "AcDbEntity") (100. "AcDbCircle") (10 5.0 6.5 0.0) (40. 2.0))
```

The entity data list that now remains with the DXF group codes 0, 100, 10, and 40 represents the entity data needed to create a new circle with the entmake function. For additional information on DXF group code values, search on「DXF entities section」in the AutoCAD Help system. Table 16.4 describes the DXF group codes 0, 100, 10, and 40.

Once you have the entity data list that describes the object you want to create, it can then be passed to the entmake function. If the entmake function is able to successfully create the new object, an entity data list is returned. If not, nil is returned. The following shows the syntax of the entmake function:

```c
(entmake [entlist])
```

The entlist argument represents the entity data list of the object to be created, and it is an optional argument. The list must contain all required dotted pairs to define the object and its properties. The following examples show how to create an entity data list with the list and cons functions, and then use the resulting list to create an object with the enmake function:

这里捡到金子了，教你如何获取用 entmake 函数新建一个实体对象需要哪些必要 `entity data list`。1）在 CAD 图纸里用普通命令画一个实体，或插入一个块实体。2）用命令 `(entget (entlast))` 查看刚刚生成的实体所包含的 `entity data list`。3）扣除掉 DXF group codes 为 -1、5 和 300 的这三个自动生成的数据。4）扣除一些可选数据。5）使用 entmake 函数创建。

### 0103. 主题卡 —— 修改实体数据的 2 种方法

AutoLISP offers two different methods for modifying the properties of an object directly. The easier of the two methods is to use the object property functions that were introduced with AutoCAD 2012. These functions require less code than the legacy approach of getting and manipulating the entity data list of an object. The property-related functions are less cryptic than entity data list manipulation as well, because you don't need to understand the various DXF group codes associated with a specific object. The downside to these functions is that they work only with AutoCAD 2012 and later, so if you need to support an earlier release you will need to manipulate entity data lists (which I cover in the next section).

Table 16.6 lists the AutoLISP functions available in AutoCAD 2012 and later that can be used to list, get, and set the properties of an object.

|  Function | Description  |
|---|---|
|  dumpallproperties |  Returns all of the properties for the specified object |
|  getpropertyvalue |  Returns the current value of an object's property |
|  setpropertyvalue |  Assigns a value to an object's property |
|  ispropertyreadonly |  Returns T or nil based on whether an object property is read-only |

### 0104. 主题卡 —— 获取并修改实体对象上的 XData

XData that has been previously attached to an object can be queried and modified by following a process that is similar to the one used to attach XData to an object. The entget function, which I discussed earlier, is used to get the entity data list and any XData lists attached to an object. By default, the entget function only returns the entity data list for the entity name that it is passed. You use the optional appname argument of the entget function to return all of the XData lists attached to an object or the one associated with a specific application name.

For example, the following code returns the entity data list and XData list attached to an object with the application name of MyApp. If there is no XData list associated with the application name MyApp, only the entity data list for the object is returned.

```c
; Return the entity data list and xdata list
(entget (entlast) '("MyApp"))
```

Using an asterisk instead of an actual application name returns the XData lists for all applications attached to an object, as shown here:

```c
; Return the entity data list and xdata list
(entget (entlast) '("*"))
```

This exercise shows how to list the XData attached to a dimension with a dimension override.

NOTE: I mentioned earlier that XData doesn't affect the appearance of an object, and that is still true even when used as we did in the previous exercise. XData itself doesn't affect the object, but AutoCAD does look for its own XData and uses it to control the way an object might be drawn. If you implement an application with the Autodesk® ObjectARX® application programming interface, you could use ObjectARX and XData to control how an object is drawn onscreen. You could also control the way an object looks using object overrules with Managed.NET and XData. ObjectARX and Managed.NET are the two advanced programming options that Autodesk supports for AutoCAD development. You can learn more about ObjectARX and Managed.NET at www.objectarx.com.

The entget function can be used to determine whether an XData list for a specific application is already attached to an object. If an XData list already exists for an object, you can then modify that list. Use the subst function to update or replace one XData list with another.

This exercise shows how to override the color assigned to dimension and extension lines, and restore the arrowhead for the dimension you created in the previous exercise.

1-2『上面介绍了修改 XData 的具体方法，以后要实现的一个重要功能需要借鉴里面的代码。管道号块的插入点结合多段线的坐标点（单一直线有 2 个 dxf code 为 10 的点、折一下的有 3 个点，折 2 下有 4 个点），给每个多段线打上管道号的标签，此标签存在 XData。反向再通过多段线给每个阀门（采用区域覆盖的块）打上管线号的标签。那么阀门和管线号的数据就关联上了，管段表和材料表就可以自动生成了，哈哈。做一张主题卡片。（2020-10-32）』

The following example removes the XData list associated with an application named ACAD from a dimension, which removes all overrides assigned to the dimension:

```c
(defun c:RemoveDimOverride (/ entityName entityData)
  (setq entityName (car (entsel "\nSelect dimension to remove overrides: ")))
  (setq entityData (entget entityName '("ACAD")))
  (if (/= (assoc -3 entityData) nil)
    (setq entityData (subst '(-3 ("ACAD")) (assoc -3 entityData) entityData))
  )
  (entmod entityData)
  (entupd entityName)
  (princ)
)
```

### 0105. 主题卡 —— 定位放大到一个特定的实体对象的坐标位置上

信息源自「2019116AutoCAD-Platform-Customization0210.md」：

In AutoLISP you can define a special function named `s::startup`. This function is executed when you create or open a drawing in AutoCAD, as long as it has been defined in a loaded LSP file. Although more than one LSP file can contain an `s::startup` function, only the last loaded definition of the function is retained. The `s::startup` function is typically used to initialize system variables, insert title blocks, or draw and modify objects in the current drawing upon opening.

Here is an example of the `s::startup` function:

```c
(defun s::startup ( / old_attreq)
  (setvar "osmode" 39) ; END, MID, CEN, and INT
  (setvar "pickfirst" 1)
  ; Create layer for title block
  (command "._-layer" "_m" "titleblk" "_c" "7" "" "")
  ; Insert title block at 0,0
  (setq old_attreq (getvar "attreq"))
  (setvar "attreq" 0)
  (command "._insert" "tb-c_size" "0,0" "1" "1" "0")
  (setvar "attreq" old_attreq)
  ; zoom to extents
  (command "._zoom" "_e")
)
```

另外的知识点：

1、系统变量 `osmode`，即「草图设置」里的对象捕捉设置值。

[Tutorial: Creating a New Custom Command and Controlling with System Variables (AutoLISP)](https://help.autodesk.com/view/OARX/2018/CHS/?guid=GUID-1330DB99-DDFA-44D0-BDEB-676FF619EBE5)

Accessing and Setting System Variable Values

System variables control the behavior of commands, change the settings of the drawing environment, and specify the default property values of new objects and much more. You can query and set the value for a system variable using the following functions:

getvar - Returns the current value of a system variable.

setvar - Assigns a new value to a system variable.

The following explain how to get and set the value of the OSMODE (Object Snap mode) system variable:

1 At the Command prompt, enter:

```
(setq cur_osmode (getvar "osmode"))
```

The current value of the OSMODE system variable is returned and assigned to the user-defined variable of `cur_osmode`. While OSMODE returns an integer value, the value is the sum of multiple "bit-code" values. For example, the value 35 indicates that the Endpoint (1), Midpoint (2), and Intersection (32) running object snaps are enabled.

2 At the Command prompt, enter: osnap.

The Drafting Settings dialog box is displayed with the Object Snap tab current. This tab allows you to see which object snaps are enabled. The following image shows what the Drafting Settings dialog box looks like when the OSMODE system variable is set to a value of 35.

3 In the Drafting Settings dialog box, change which object snaps are current and click OK.

4 At the Command prompt, enter:

```c
(getvar "osmode")
```

The current value of the OSMODE system variable is returned.

5 At the Command prompt, enter:

```c
(setvar "osmode" cur_osmode)
```

The value of the OSMODE system variable is restored to the value that was previously assigned to the user-defined variable `cur_osmode`.

6 Display the Drafting Settings dialog box again. You should see that the object snap settings have been restored.

Note: Before you make a change to the drawing environment, it is good practice to store the values of any system variables, and then restore them before your program ends.

2、修改系统环境变量值养成修改回原值的习惯。前面的备注（note）讲的就是这点，包括本书作者前面的例子里，有关「块」的系统变量 `attreq` 后面也改回去了。这个系统变量值以前用到过，插入块的命令是，如果改值为 0，就不会一个一个提示属性值。

### 0106. 主题卡 —— Defining a Plug-in Bundle

信息源自「2019116AutoCAD-Platform-Customization0210.md」：

1-2『重点来了，实现付费的方法，意外收获，没想到在这里看到相关信息。插件式捆绑，做一张主题卡片。（2021-03-05）』—— 已完成

A plug-in bundle, as I previously mentioned, is one of the methods that can be used to deploy your LSP files. Fundamentally, a bundle is simply a folder structure with its topmost folder having `.bundle` appended to its name and a manifest file with the filename PackageContents.xml located in the topmost folder. You can use Windows Explorer or File Explorer on Windows, or Finder on Mac OS, to define and name the folder structure of a bundle. The PackageContents.xml file can be created with a plain ASCII text editor, such as Notepad on Windows or TextEdit on Mac OS.

The following is an example PackageContents.xml file that defines the contents of a bundle named DrawPlate.bundle that contains three files: a help file named DrawPlate.htm, and two LSP files named DrawPlate.lsp and Utility.lsp:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?><!DOCTYPE component PUBLIC "-//JWS//DTD WileyML 20110801 Vers 3Gv2.0//EN" "Wileyml3gv20-flat.dtd">
  <Components Description="All OSs">
    <RuntimeRequirements OS="Win32|Win64|Mac" SeriesMin="R19.0" Platform="AutoCAD*" SupportPath="./Contents/" />
    <ComponentEntry Description="Main LSP file" AppName="DrawPlateMain" Version="1.0" ModuleName="./Contents/DrawPlate.lsp"> </ComponentEntry>
    <ComponentEntry Description="Utility LSP file" AppName="UtilityFunctions" Version="1.0" ModuleName="./Contents/Utility.lsp"> </ComponentEntry>
  </Components>
</ApplicationPackage>
```

The folder structure of the bundle that the PackageContents.xml file refers to looks like this:

```
DrawPlate.bundle
  PackageContents.xml
  Contents
    DrawPlate.lsp
    DrawPlate.htm
    Utility.lsp
```

I have provided the DrawPlate.bundle as part of the sample files for this book, but you will also learn how to create the DrawPlate.bundle yourself later in this chapter. To use the bundle with AutoCAD, copy the DrawPlate.bundle folder and all of its contents to one of the following locations so that all users can access the files:

```
%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\Application Data\Autodesk\ApplicationPlugIns (Windows XP)

%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\Autodesk\ApplicationPlugIns (Windows 7 or Windows 8)

/Applications/Autodesk/ApplicationAddIns (Mac OS)
```

If you want a bundle to be accessible only by a specific user, place that bundle into one of the following locations under that user's profile:

```
%APPDATA%\Autodesk\ApplicationPlugIns (Windows)

˜/Autodesk/ApplicationAddIns (Mac OS)
```

For additional information on the elements used to define a PackageContents.xml file, perform a search in the AutoCAD Help system on the keyword「PackageContents.xml.」

NOTE: The appautoload system variable controls when bundles are loaded into AutoCAD. By default, bundles are loaded at startup, when a new drawing is opened, and when a plug-in is added to the ApplicationPlugins or ApplicationAddIns folder. You can use the appautoloader command to list which bundles are loaded or reload all the bundles that are available to AutoCAD.

For example, the layer status property (DXF group code 70) of a layer is a bit-coded value that contains various flags used to specify whether the layer is frozen (1 bit), locked (4 bit), or dependent on an xref (16 bit). The osmode system variable is another example of a bit-coded value in AutoCAD. In the osmode system variable, the value indicates which running object snaps are currently enabled. Refer to the AutoCAD Help system to determine whether an object property or system variable is an integer or bit-coded value.

### 0109. 主题卡 —— entity name 跟 vla-object 相互转换

信息源自「2019116AutoCAD-Platform-Customization0212.md」：

The graphical and nongraphical objects stored in a drawing can be accessed using ActiveX. As defined by the drawing architecture, all graphical objects are stored in a Block object and can be accessed from the Blocks collection. Model space and paper space are special types of Block objects that you can manipulate without performing any special operation. The Blocks collection is just one of several collections that allow you to create and access nongraphical objects in a drawing.

NOTE 22.5: The vla-object data type isn't compatible with the ename data type. You can convert vla-object values to an entity name (ename) by using the `vlax-vla-object->ename` function. The `vlax-ename->vla-object` function converts an ename to a vla-object data type. Additionally, you can use the `vla-get-handle` function to get an object's handle and then use the handent function to get an object's ename based on a valid handle. These functions are helpful if you are mixing the use of Classic AutoLISP functions that work with the ename data type, such as entget or ssname, and those used to work with objects of the AutoCAD COM library. Examples of these functions, with the exception of `vlax-vla-object->ename`, can be found in the `ch22_mswin_office.lsp` file, which you can download from this book's web page, www.sybex.com/go/autocadcustomization.

When you want to add an object, such as a Layer object, to a collection, you can use one of the many Add methods available through the AutoCAD COM library. The following exercise shows how to create a function that checks for the existence of a layer and that creates the layer if it's not found; it then sets the layer as current by using the AutoCAD COM library and ActiveX. The function is similar to the createlayer function that you defined in the utility.lsp file in the various exercises throughout this book.

### 0110. 主题卡 —— 如何创建 2 类 dictionary

信息源自「附件2-Dictionaries-and-XRecords.md」：

Ok, so a Dictionary is a container that can hold a number of objects. Why not use existing structures like symbol tables instead of complicating things? Many reasons, but two reasons come to mind. Symbol tables are maintained by the people who implemented them and to expand them to hold every possible custom object is not an option. Secondly, Dictionaries can be customized in a way that is not possible with symbol tables, and that opens a range of possibilities only limited by imagination.

Dictionaries and XRecords go hand in hand. Like Dictionaries, XRecords are handled as named objects and can be manipulated by the same functions that handle Dictionaries. In the following, we'll try to add our own Dictionary to the main dictionary. We will also create an XRecord to hold various informations and add it to our Dictionary.

1『这里慢慢有点懂 XRecord 和 Dictionaries 的关系了。Dictionaries 是容器，XRecord 可以绑数据然后加进 Dictionaries 里。（2021-03-28）』

When dealing with Dictionaries, at one point you will have to consider ownership. Which object is going to own the Dictionary? Will it hold generic data for your application or will it hold data that is specific for some entity or entities? In the first case you will probably use the main dictionary to save your data with the drawing. If your application is maintaining data for linetypes, you will probably add an extension dictionary to the linetype symbol table. Whatever the ownership, the Dictionary is initially created without ownership and for that purpose we'll use the function ENTMAKEX. It works like ENTMAKE, but it creates the entity without an owner — and it returns an entity name instead of an entity list. Let's make a function that adds our own Dictionary to the main dictionary. In this example we will name it "OUR_DICT" :

### 0111. 主题卡 —— 如何删除 symbol table 实体对象

信息源自「2019116AutoCAD-Platform-Customization0207.md」

Since the same techniques can be used to create and modify both graphical and symbol table entries, you might think that removing a symbol table entry and a graphical object would also be the same in AutoLISP. The `entdel` function is used to remove graphical objects, but it cannot be used to remove symbol table entries. This is one of the very few times that you can't use「classic」AutoLISP to do something. Instead of using a specific AutoLISP function, you must use the command function with the `-purge` command to remove a symbol-table object.

You can use the `tblobjname` and `tblsearch` functions to determine whether a specific symbol table entry exists in a drawing, and then use the `-purge` command to remove it. If the symbol table entry doesn't exist or cannot be removed because it is being used, the `-purge` command will end gracefully without any significant error messages that require user interaction to dismiss. Here's an example of how to remove a block named roomlabel from a drawing with the `-purge` command:

```c
(command "._-purge" "_b" "roomlabel" "_n")
```

NOTE: On Windows only, you can use the AutoLISP `vla-delete` function after loading the AutoCAD ActiveX/COM interface with the `vl-load-com` function. I discuss the basics of using ActiveX with AutoLISP in Chapter 22,「Working with ActiveX/COM Libraries (Windows only).」

### 0112. 主题卡 —— 自动生成块定义

Creating separate drawing files that your custom programs depend on has its advantages and disadvantages. The advantage of creating a separate drawing file is that you can use the AutoCAD user interface to create the block file. However, AutoCAD will need to know where the drawing file is stored so the custom program can use the file. The advantage of creating the block definition through code is that no separate drawing file needs to be maintained, making it easier to share your custom application with your clients or subcontractors.

In these steps, you create a custom function named `roomlabel_createblkdef` that will be used to create the block definition for the room label block if it doesn't already exist in the drawing.

1 Create a new LSP file named roomlabel.lsp using Notepad (on Windows) or TextEdit (on Mac OS).

2 In the text editor area of the roomlabel.lsp file, type the following:

```c
; Creates the block definition roomlabel
(defun RoomLabel_CreateBlkDef ( / )
  (setvar "clayer" "0")
  ; Start block definition
  (entmake (list (cons 0 "BLOCK") (cons 2 "roomlabel")

  ; Create the rectangle for around the block attribute

  ; Add the attribute definition
  (entmake (list (cons 0 "ATTDEF") (cons 100 "AcDbEntity")
                 (cons 8 "Plan_RoomLabel_Anno") (cons 100 "AcDbText")

### 0113. 主题卡 —— mode_tile 设置 tile 激活状态

信息源自「2019116AutoCAD-Platform-Customization0213.md」

The tiles of a dialog box are all enabled by default, meaning the user can click or enter text in any interactive tile of a dialog box. The `is_enabled` attribute of a tile controls the tile's default enabled state. When `is_enabled` is set to false, the user is unable to interact with the tile when the dialog box is displayed. The enabled state of a tile can be changed using the `mode_tile` function.

I recommend setting the enabled state of a tile using the mode_tile function and not the is_enabled attribute. The main reason for doing so is because the disabling of a tile is often based on the condition of other tiles or choices made by the user in the dialog box. I discuss how to handle user interaction with tiles in the「Interacting with and Responding to a User」section.

1-2『作者建议 `mode_tile` 来设置 tile 的激活状态，不用用 tile 自身的属性 `is_enabled` 来设置，记住这点。（2020-10-09）补充：`mode_tile` 设置 tile 激活状态，做一张主题卡片。（2021-07-03）』—— 已完成

The following shows the syntax of the `mode_tile` function:

```c
(mode_tile key mode)
```

Here are its arguments:

key. The key argument is a string that specifies the value assigned to the key attribute of the tile you want to modify.

mode. The mode argument is an integer value that specifies the mode that should be applied to the tile. Table 23.8 lists the available modes that can be applied to a tile.

|  Mode | Description  |
|---|---|
| 0 | Enables an interactive tile |
| 1 | Disables an interactive tile |
| 2 | Sets focus to an interactive tile |
| 3 | Selects the text in an edit_box tile |
| 4 | Toggles highlighting for an image tile |

### 0201. 术语卡 —— Dotted Pair

Dotted Pair. A dotted pair is a list of two values separated by a period. Dotted pairs are commonly used to represent property values for an object. The first value of a dotted pair is sometimes referred to as a DXF group code. For example, `(40 . 2.0)` represents the radius of a circle; DXF group code value 40 indicates the radius property, and 2.0 is the actual radius value for the circle. When you're assigning a dotted pair to a variable, either the pair must be preceded by an apostrophe, as in `(setq dxf_40 '(40 . 2))`, or you must use the AutoLISP cons function, as in `(setq dxf_40 (cons 40 2))`. You'll learn more about creating and manipulating dotted pairs in Chapter 16.

### 0202. 术语卡 —— XData

信息源自「2019116AutoCAD-Platform-Customization0206.md」

Each object in a drawing has a pre-established set of properties that define how that object should appear or behave. These properties are used to define the size of a circle or the location of a line within a drawing. Although you can't add a new property to an object with AutoLISP, you can append custom information to an object. The custom information that you can append to an object is known as extended data, or XData.

XData is structured similar to an entity data list except the values must be within a specific range of DXF group codes. Each XData list must contain an application name to identify one XData list from another since several XData lists can be attached to an object. After the application name, an XData list can contain any valid values and be of any type of data that AutoLISP supports.

The values in an XData list and what they represent is up to you, the creator of the data. Data in an XData list can be used to identify where an object should be placed or which layer it should be on, to store information about an external database record that is related to an object, or to build relationships between objects in a drawing. The way data is used or enforced is up to you as the programmer.

In addition to XData, graphical and nongraphical objects support what are known as extension dictionaries. Extension dictionaries are kind of like record tables that can be attached to an object. For example, you could store revision history of a drawing in an extension dictionary that is attached to model space, and then populate that information in the drawing's title block. I discuss creating custom dictionaries in Chapter 17.

2『 XData 做一张术语卡片。』—— 已完成

Once you have defined an application name and registered it in a drawing, you can attach an XData list to an object within that drawing. An XData list is made up of two lists and has a total size limit of 16 KB per object (see the「Managing the Memory Used by XData for an Object」sidebar for information). The outer list contains a DXF group code -3 and an inner list that contains the application name and dotted pairs that represent the data values to store with the object. Each dotted pair contains a DXF group code that defines the type of data the pair represents and then the actual value of the pair.

DXF group codes used for dotted pairs in an XData list must be within the range of 1000 to 1071. Each DXF group code value in that range represents a different type of data, and you can use each DXF group code more than once in an XData list. Table 16.8 lists some of the commonly used DXF group codes for XData.

Table 16.8 XData-related DXF group codes

|  DXF group code | Description  |
|---|---|
|  1000  |  String value |
|  1001 |  Application name |
|  1010  |  3D point |
|  1040 |  Real numeric value |
|  1070 |  16-bit (unsigned or signed) integer value |
|  1071 |  32-bit signed integer value |

The following AutoLISP statements were used to create the previous XData list:

```c
(setq appName "MyApp")
(regapp "MyApp")
(setq xdataList
  (list -3 (list appName
                 (cons 1000 "My custom application")
                 (cons 1070 (fix (getvar "cdate")))))
)
```

Once an XData list has been defined, it can be appended to an entity data list returned by the AutoLISP entget function with the append function. I explained how to append lists together in Chapter 14. After an XData list is appended to an entity data list, you use the entmod function to commit changes to the object and entupd to update the object in the drawing area. I explained the entmod and entupd functions earlier in this chapter. This exercise shows how to attach an XData list to a circle:

1 At the AutoCAD Command prompt, type the following and press Enter to register the MyApp application:

```c
(setq appName "MyApp")
(regapp appName)
```

2 Type the following and press Enter to assign the XData list to the xdataList variable:

```c
(setq xdataList
  (list -3 (list appName
                 (cons 1000 "My custom application")
                 (cons 1070 (fix (getvar "cdate")))))
)
```

The XData list assigned to the xdataList variable is as follows:

```c
(-3 ("MyApp" (1000. "My custom application") (1070. 20140302)))
```

3 Type the following and press Enter to create a new circle:

```c
(entmake (list (cons 0 "CIRCLE") (cons 10 (list 2 2 0)) (cons 40 1)))
(setq circ (entlast))
```

A circle with the center point of 2,2 is created with a radius of 1, and the entity name of the new circle is assigned to the circ variable.

4 Type the following and press Enter to get the entity data list of the circle and assign it to the entData variable:

```c
(setq entityData (entget circ))
```

The entity data list of the circle should be similar to the following:

```c
((-1. <Entity name: 7ff722905e90>) (0. "CIRCLE") (330. <Entity name: 7ff7229039f0>) (5. "1E1") (100. "AcDbEntity") (67. 0) (410. "Model") (8. "0") (100. "AcDbCircle") (10 2.0 2.0 0.0) (40. 1.0) (210 0.0 0.0 1.0))
```

5 Type the following and press Enter to append the lists in the entityData and xdataList variables:

```c
(setq entityData (append entityData (list xdataList)))
```

The resulting list is assigned to the entityData variable and should look similar to the following:

```c
((-1. <Entity name: 7ff722905e50>) (0. "CIRCLE") (330. <Entity name: 7ff7229039f0>) (5. "1DD")(100. "AcDbEntity") (67. 0) (410. "Model") (8. "0")(100. "AcDbCircle") (10 2.0 2.0 0.0) (40. 1.0) (210 0.0 0.0 1.0)(-3 ("MyApp" (1000. "Drill_Hole") (1070. 20140302))))
```

6 Type the following and press Enter to commit the changes to the circle and update the circle's display:

```c
(entmod entityData)
(entupd circ)
```

The circle object won't look any different after the changes have been committed because the XData doesn't affect the appearance of the object. However, you can now differentiate this circle from those that might be created with the circle command. This makes it much easier to locate and update the radius of the circles that represent a drill hole in your drawing.

### 0203. 术语卡 —— 图形数据和非图形数据

The AutoLISP® programming language is great for creating and modifying objects. There are two types of objects that you can create or modify: graphical and nongraphical. Graphical objects are those that you can see and interact with in the drawing area, whether in model or paper space. Nongraphical objects are those that you don't create in the drawing area but that can affect the appearance of graphical objects. I discuss working with nongraphical objects in Chapter 17,「Creating and Modifying Nongraphical Objects.」

### 0204. 术语卡 —— Block Definitions and Block References

Block references are often misunderstood by new (and even experienced) AutoLISP developers. Blocks are implemented as two separate objects: block definitions and block references. Block definitions are nongraphical objects that are stored in a drawing and contain the geometry and attribute definitions that make up how the block should appear and behave in the drawing area. A block definition can also contain custom properties and dynamic properties.

Understanding Block Definitions and Block References. You can think of a block definition much like a cookie recipe. The recipe lists the ingredients that make up the cookie and explains how those ingredients are combined for a particular taste, but it doesn't control where the dough will be placed on the baking sheet or the size of the unbaked cookies. The placement and amount of the cookie dough on the sheet would be similar to a block reference in a drawing.

A block reference displays an instance, not a copy, of the geometry from a block definition; the geometry exists only as part of the block definition, with the exception of attributes. Attribute definitions that are part of a block definition are added to a block reference as attributes unless the attribute definition is defined as a constant attribute. Constant attributes are parts of the geometry inherited from a block definition and aren't part of the block reference.

1-3『块定义和块参照，对应于面向对象的类和对象，块参照是块定义的实例化。（2021-03-10）补充：这里的常量属性值（constant attribute）是指设了默认值的属性，那么引用块参照的时候不用对其赋值。（2021-04-06）』

When creating a block reference with AutoLISP, as opposed to inserting it with the insert command, you are responsible for adding any attributes to the block reference that aren't designated as constant within the block definition. Like the old-style polyline, block references use the seqend object to designate the end of an insert object. Between the insert and seqend objects of a block reference are attrib objects that represent the attribute references that aren't set as constant and must be added to a block reference.

Since attributes must be added to a block reference, it is possible to have a block definition that contains attribute definitions and a block reference that points to that block definition without any attributes. It is also possible to have a block reference that has attributes attached to it and a block reference that doesn't have any attribute definitions.

The following code adds a block definition named RoomNum (see Figure 16.4) to a drawing that has a single attribute with the tag ROOM#:

```c
; Creates the block definition RoomNum
(entmake (list (cons 0 "BLOCK") (cons 2 "roomnum") (cons 10 (list 18.0 9.0 0.0)) (cons 70 2)))

; Creates the rectangle for around the block attribute
(entmake (list (cons 0 "LWPOLYLINE") (cons 100 "AcDbEntity") (cons 100 "AcDbPolyline")
  (cons 90 4) (cons 70 1) (cons 43 0) (cons 10 (list 0.0 0.0 0.0)) (cons 10 (list 36.0 0.0 0.0))
  (cons 10 (list 36.0 18.0 0.0)) (cons 10 (list 0.0 18.0 0.0)))
)

; Adds the attribute definition
(entmake (list (cons 0 "ATTDEF") (cons 100 "AcDbEntity") (cons 100 "AcDbText")
  (cons 10 (list 18.0 9.0 0.0)) (cons 40 9.0) (cons 1 "L000") (cons 7 "Standard")
  (cons 72 1) (cons 11 (list 18.0 9.0 0.0)) (cons 100 "AcDbAttributeDefinition")
  (cons 280 0) (cons 3 "ROOM#") (cons 2 "ROOM#") (cons 70 0) (cons 74 2) (cons 280 1))
)

; Ends block definition
(entmake (list (cons 0 "ENDBLK")))
```

Figure 16.4 RoomNum block reference inserted with AutoLISP

Once the block definition is created, you can then use the following code to add a block reference to a drawing based on a block named RoomNum:

```c
; Creates a block reference based on the block definition BlockNumber at 1.0,-0.5
(entmake '((0. "INSERT")(100. "AcDbEntity")(100. "AcDbBlockReference") (66. 1) (2. "roomnum") (10 1.0 -0.5 0.0)))

; Creates an attribute reference with the tag ROOM# and adds it to the block
(entmake '((0. "ATTRIB") (100. "AcDbEntity") (100. "AcDbText") (10 0.533834 -0.7 0.0)
  (40. 9.0) (1. "101") (7. "Standard") (71. 0) (72. 1) (11 1.0 -0.5 0.0)
  (100. "AcDbAttribute") (280. 0) (2. "ROOM#") (70. 0) (74. 2) (280. 1))
)

; Adds the end marker for the block reference
(entmake ' ((0. "SEQEND") (100. "AcDbEntity")))
```

If you want to extract the values of the attributes attached to a block, you must get the constant attribute values from the block definition and the nonconstant attribute values that are attached as part of the block reference. You use the entnext function to step through each object in a block definition and block reference, collecting information from the reference objects. All attribute definitions (attdef) or attribute reference (attrib) objects must be read until the last or seqend object is encountered.

Listing 16.3 shows a custom function that demonstrates how to step through a block reference and its block definition with the while function. You must load the custom functions in Listing 16.2 before executing the code in Listing 16.3. The code in Listing 16.2 and Listing 16.3 can be found in the `ch16_code_listings.lsp` file that is available for download from this book's website.

### 0205. 术语卡 —— 选择集

A selection set, sometimes known as a selection set name or ssname for short, is a temporary container that holds a reference to objects in a drawing. AutoLISP represents a selection set with the PICKFIRST data type. You get a selection set, commonly based on the objects in a drawing that the user wants to modify or interact with. For example, when you see the Select objects: prompt AutoCAD is asking you to select the objects in the drawing you want to work with and it gets a selection set containing the objects you selected in return.

In addition to getting a selection set based on user input, you can create a selection set manually and add objects to it. You might want to create a function that steps through a drawing and locates all the objects on a specific layer, and then returns a selection set that the next function can work with. Once a selection set is created, you can add additional objects or remove objects that don't meet the requirements you want to work with. A selection set makes it efficient to query and modify a large number of objects.

### 0206. 术语卡 —— bit-coded values

信息源自「2019116AutoCAD-Platform-Customization0210.md」：

Integer values can be used to represent what is known as a bit pattern or bit-coded value. A bit-coded value is the sum of one or more bits. A bit is a binary value; when one or more bits are combined they create a unique sum. AutoCAD uses bit-coded values for many different object properties (DXF group codes) and system variables.

2『这里的 bit-coded values 做一张术语卡片。（2021-03-06）』—— 已完成

For example, the layer status property (DXF group code 70) of a layer is a bit-coded value that contains various flags used to specify whether the layer is frozen (1 bit), locked (4 bit), or dependent on an xref (16 bit). The osmode system variable is another example of a bit-coded value in AutoCAD. In the osmode system variable, the value indicates which running object snaps are currently enabled. Refer to the AutoCAD Help system to determine whether an object property or system variable is an integer or bit-coded value.

Because a bit-coded value is represented by the integer data type, you can use the `+` and `–` functions to add or remove a bit value for the overall sum of a bit-coded value. AutoLISP also provides several useful functions that you can use when working with bit-coded values. The logior and logand functions help combine several bit-coded values and determine whether a bit is part of a bit-coded value. Let's take a closer look at the logior and logand functions.

3.1.8 Working with Bit-Coded Values

The following exercise demonstrates how to work with bit-coded values. You'll create a custom function that allows you to toggle the state of the INTersection object snap. The current running object snap modes are stored in the osmode system variable, which contains a bit-coded value. The INTersection object snap is represented by the bit code 32.

### 0207. 术语卡 —— Inline Variable Expansion

信息源自「2019116AutoCAD-Platform-Customization0203.md」：

Inline variable expansion is the process of defining a variable and then adding the name of the variable using the format `%VARIABLE_NAME%` (Windows) or `${VARIABLE_NAME}` (Mac OS) in a string. The name of the variable is then replaced with the variable's actual value when the expression containing the string is used. Inline variable expansion is not native functionality in AutoLISP, but it can be simulated. Inline variable expansion is supported by other programming languages and is often used with values that are defined by the operating system. Listing 13.1 in this section demonstrates one possible implementation of inline variable expansion in AutoLISP.

1『太惊喜了，autolisp 里竟然也能模拟内联变量，那种很常用的，嵌入在字符串里的变量，感谢作者的源码，哈哈。做一张术语卡片。（2021-03-06）』

Listing 13.1 is a custom function that mimics the use of inline variable expansion. When the function is executed, it attempts to match the text between % (percent) signs with a user-defined variable. If the variable is found, the inline variable is replaced by its current value.

Listing 13.1: The ExpandVariable function

```c
; Custom implementation of expanding variables in AutoLISP
; To use:
; 1. Define a variable with the setq function.
; 2. Add the variable name with % symbols on both sides of the variable name.
; For example, the variable named *program* would appear as %*program*% in the string.
; 3. Use the function on the string that contains the variable.
(defun expandvariableUtils (string / start_pos next_pos var2expand expand_var)
  (while (wcmatch string "*%*%*")
         (progn

          (setq next_pos (vl-string-search "%" string start_pos))
          (setq var2expand (substr string start_pos (- (+ next_pos 2) start_pos)))
          (setq expand_var (vl-princ-to-string (eval (read (vl-string-trim "%" var2expand)))))
          (if (/= expand_var nil)
            (setq string (vl-string-subst expand_var var2expand string))
          )
         )
  )

### 0208. 术语卡 —— ActiveX/COM

信息源自「2019116AutoCAD-Platform-Customization0212.md」：

The AutoLISP® functions you have learned up to this point have been, for the most part, platform neutral and are unofficially known as Classic AutoLISP or Core AutoLISP. Starting with the Autodesk® AutoCAD® 2000 program, AutoLISP saw an architecture change that allowed for the use of the Microsoft ActiveX technology. ActiveX is a technology that enables applications to communicate and exchange information. COM (Component Object Model) is a library of objects that let you make changes to or query exposed objects. COM is an example of ActiveX.

1『这里 ActiveX/COM 本质上是一个库，做一张术语卡片。（2021-03-06）』

In this chapter, you will learn the basics of using ActiveX with AutoLISP and how to leverage the AutoCAD, Microsoft Windows, and Microsoft Office COM libraries. Although this chapter doesn't go into great depth, it will give you a starting point and a general understanding of the functions you need to become familiar with in order to use ActiveX and access COM libraries. The primary reasons to use COM are to monitor actions in AutoCAD with reactors, access external applications such as Microsoft Word or Excel, and work with complex objects, such as tables and multileaders.

1『这里的信息超级重要。COM 的主要用途有三：1）在 CAD 用 reactors 监视动作。2）跟外部的 word 和 excel 交互。3）操作复杂对象，比如 tables and multileaders。（2021-04-06）』

ActiveX is the technology that allows for the use of COM. It is often associated with Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) and Visual Basic (VB) scripting these days, but it can be used by many modern programming languages, such as VB.NET and C++. Although many people refer to ActiveX and COM as the same thing, they aren't. ActiveX is the technology that was developed by Microsoft to allow software developers to expose objects using COM, thereby letting programmers communicate with the programs in new ways.

In general, there are three concepts you need to understand about working with ActiveX in AutoLISP programs: 1) Classes, objects, and collections. 2) Methods and properties. 3) Variant and array data types.

### 0209. 术语卡 —— Collections

信息源自「2019116AutoCAD-Platform-Customization0212.md」：

Collections are objects that can be queried and modified using properties and methods, but they are also containers that hold similar objects. A collection fundamentally is similar to a symbol table; you can work with a symbol table and add new objects to it, but you can't create a new symbol table. All the collections that you need in order to work with AutoCAD objects are defined as part of the AutoCAD ActiveX API. For example, a Layers collection contains all of the Layer objects in a drawing, and a Documents collection contains all the open drawings (or Document objects) in the current AutoCAD session. You can get an object from a collection using the Item method, add a new object to a collection using the Add method, and remove an object from a collection using the Delete method.

If you want to step through a collection and perform a set of statements on each object, you can use the `vlax-for` AutoLISP function, which is similar to the `foreach` function. The following shows the syntax of the vlax-for function:

```c
(vlax-for var coll [expressionN …])
```

### 0210. 术语卡 —— Variants and Arrays

信息源自「2019116AutoCAD-Platform-Customization0212.md」：

vla-object isn't the only new data type that you will have to understand when working with ActiveX. Many methods and properties use what is known as a variant. The variant data type is the chameleon of data types; it can represent any supported data type. A variant in AutoLISP is represented by the vla-variant data type. Arrays are yet another type of data that you will need to become familiar with. An array is represented by the vla-array data type and is similar to the AutoLISP list data type.

2『这里的 Variants and Arrays，做一张术语卡片。（2021-03-07）』—— 已完成

Most properties and methods return or expect values of a specific type, but there will be times when you will need to assign a property or pass a method a variant value. Some data structures can represent multiple values, such as a point or Xdata, and in these situations the AutoCAD COM library is designed to return or accept a variant value. You define a variant by using the `vlax-make-variant` function. The following shows the syntax of the `vlax-make-variant` function:

The array data type is similar to the AutoLISP list data type, but typically an array is made up of a specified number of elements. You will remember that a list can hold any number of elements. A common use for arrays with the AutoCAD COM library is to represent a point list. Arrays can also be used to pass multiple objects to a method or for times when you want to return more than one value from a custom function.

The `vlax-make-safearray` function is used to create a new array based on a specific data type and number of elements. The following shows the syntax of the `vlax-make-safearray` function:

### 0211. 术语卡 —— symbol tables

源自「2019116AutoCAD-Platform-Customization0217.md」：

A drawing file can contain two types of nongraphical objects: symbol tables and named dictionaries. Symbol tables represent the original named objects that were available in the AutoCAD® R12 release and earlier ones. Support for named dictionaries was added with AutoCAD R13 to handle new and custom objects without the need for a new drawing file format. In this chapter, you will learn to create, manage, and use symbol table and dictionary entries.

1-2『symbol tables and named dictionaries，各做一张术语卡片。（2021-03-11）』

Symbol tables are the oldest form of nongraphical objects used in drawing files and have been unchanged since AutoCAD R12. Although the features that use symbol tables have changed since AutoCAD R12, the additional information that those features use in later releases is attached as either XData or an extension dictionary on an entry or the symbol table.

Have you opened a drawing from a client to find what seems like a spaghetti mess of layers, linetypes, and text styles that just don't work well with your standards? Maybe the Standard text style in the client's drawings uses a fixed height and different font than your company uses, which would affect the way your blocks and annotation might look like in the drawing. Using the AutoLIS® programming language, you can create or change nongraphical objects stored in symbol tables or dictionaries so they align with your company's standards. Aligning the standards in the drawings received from a client ensure that the objects you create and those in the drawings plot with a consistent appearance.

For example, the transparency level and description of a layer is attached as XData to a layer table entry, and both layer states and filters are attached as extension dictionaries to the layer table. I covered XData in Chapter 16,「Creating and Modifying Graphical Objects」and will discuss dictionaries in the section「Working with Dictionaries」later in this chapter.

### 0212. 术语卡 —— named dictionaries

源自「2019116AutoCAD-Platform-Customization0217.md」：

Dictionaries are used to store custom information and objects in a drawing and can be thought of as symbol tables 2.0. Dictionaries were introduced with AutoCAD R13 as a way to introduce new symbol tables like objects without the need to change the drawing file format with each release. Although there is only one type of dictionary in a drawing, dictionaries can be stored in two different ways: per drawing or per object.

The main dictionary of a drawing contains nested dictionaries that store multileader and table styles, and even the layouts used to output a drawing. Dictionaries attached to an object are known as extension dictionaries. Extension dictionaries are similar to XData but allow you to attach more information to a single object. AutoCAD uses extension dictionaries attached to the layer symbol table to store the information used for layer states and filters.

Custom dictionaries are great for storing custom program settings so that they persist across drawing sessions. You might also use a custom dictionary as a way to store drawing revision history or project information that can be used to track a drawing and populate a title block. In this section, you'll learn how to access, create, query, and modify information stored in a dictionary.

1『字典 dictionaries 做一张术语卡片。（2021-03-26）』—— 已完成

The dictionary-related AutoLISP functions are similar to those used when working with symbol tables. Before you can access the entries in a dictionary, you must first get a dictionary. The `namedobjdict` function returns the entity name of the drawing's named-object dictionary. This is the main dictionary that contains all the dictionaries that aren't attached to an object as an extension dictionary. The `namedobjdict` function doesn't require any arguments.

Once you have the entity name of the named object dictionary, use the entget function to get an entity data list that contains the key entries and entity names for each dictionary. Each entry in the named object dictionary is represented by two dotted pairs. The first dotted pair represents the unique name of a dictionary and DXF group code 3. The second dotted pair contains the entity name for the dictionary and DXF group code 350.

Here's an example of an entity data list for a named object dictionary:

```c
((-1. <Entity name: 7ff6646038c0>) (0. "DICTIONARY") (330. <Entity name: 0>)
(5. "C") (100. "AcDbDictionary") (280. 0) (281. 1)
(3. "ACAD_COLOR") (350. <Entity name: 7ff664603c30>)
(3. "ACAD_GROUP") (350. <Entity name: 7ff6646038d0>)
(3. "ACAD_VISUALSTYLE") (350. <Entity name: 7ff6646039a0>)
(3. "ACAD_MATERIAL") (350. <Entity name: 7ff664603c20>))
```

先创建字典：

As I mentioned earlier, one of the benefits of dictionaries is that you can store custom information or settings related to the programs you create in a drawing. Before a custom dictionary can be used and entries added to it, it must first be created. The `entmakex` function, not entmake, is used to create a dictionary. Once created, the new dictionary can be attached to either the named object dictionary or an object as an extension dictionary. You attach the new dictionary to the drawing's named object dictionary with the dictadd function.

The following shows the syntax of the dictadd function:

```c
(dictadd ename key_entry dictionary)
```

TIP: User-defined variables are normally accessible only from the drawing in which they are defined, but you can use the AutoLISP `vl-bb-ref` and `vl-bb-set` functions to define variables on what is known as the blackboard. The blackboard is a centralized location for defining variables that can be accessed from any open drawing. The AutoLISP vl-propagate function can also be used to define a variable with a specific value in all open drawings and any drawings that are subsequently opened in the AutoCAD session. You can learn more about these functions in the AutoCAD Help system.

A namespace called the blackboard is used for communicating values across all namespaces. The blackboard namespace is not attached to any document or VLX application. You can set and reference variables in the blackboard from any document or VLX application. Use the vl-bb-set function to set a variable, and use vl-bb-ref to retrieve a variable's value.

For example, the following sets the foobar variable to a string in the blackboard namespace:

```c
(vl-bb-set 'foobar "Root toot toot")
```

The vl-bb-ref function returns the specified string. The following uses the vl-bb-ref function to retrieve the value of the foobar variable from the blackboard namespace:

```c
(vl-bb-ref 'foobar)
```

Setting or retrieving variable values in the blackboard namespace has no effect on variables of the same name in any other namespace.

vl-propagate. Copies the value of a variable into all open document namespaces (and sets its value in any subsequent drawings opened during the current AutoCAD session)

When the command function is used, you can suspend the execution of an AutoLISP program and allow the user to provide input at the Command prompt.

The following AutoLISP expression starts the circle command and then allows the user to specify a center point. Once a center point is specified, the circle's diameter is set to 3 units.

```c

(These functions are available only on Windows.) There are a couple reasons you might want to do so. The first is so that your custom functions trigger events or reactors related to when a command starts or ends. The other reason is so that your custom function can be called with the command or command-s function. You can learn more about these functions in the AutoCAD Help system.

You can create a DCL file with Notepad or the Visual LISP Editor; you follow the same process you use to create a LSP file. The only difference is that you specify a file extension of .dcl instead of .lsp. Once you create a DCL file, you can add a dialog box definition to the file. To see what the dialog box looks like, you must load the DCL file in the AutoCAD drawing environment and display it. There are two approaches available for viewing a DCL file. The first is to create an AutoLISP program that loads and displays the file; the other involves using the Visual LISP Editor. (The second approach eliminates the need to write any code.) I discuss how to load a DCL file and display a dialog box in the next section.

### 0308. 任意卡 —— 通过特定的动作直接更新交互界面的下拉列表数据

Populating the Items of a `list_box` or `popup_list` Tile.

The `list_box` and `popup_list` tiles allow the user to select one or more predefined values from a list. The items available in the list of the two tiles can be specified using the tile's list attribute or AutoLISP functions. The `start_list` function is used to assign, update, or replace the list of values applied to a `list_box` or `popup_list` tile. When a list can be modified, the `start_list` function returns the name of the list; otherwise the function returns nil, indicating the list isn't accessible for modification. Typically, a list isn't available for modification because you provided an incorrect key to the `start_list` function or the function was called before the execution of the `new_dialog` function.

The following shows the syntax of the `start_list` function:

```c
(start_list key [mode [idx]])
```

Here are its arguments:

key. The key argument is a string that specifies the value assigned to the key attribute of the tile you want to modify.

mode. The mode argument is an integer value that specifies how the list currently assigned to the tile can be modified. Table 23.9 describes each of the available modes.

idx. The idx argument is an integer value that specifies an item in the list. The item is used to indicate which item to change if the mode is set to 1; when the mode is set to 2, it indicates the starting item you want to begin appending new items to.

Table 23.9 describes the modification modes that can be used to edit a list.

|  Mode | Description  |
|---|---|
| 1 | Next call to `add_list` replaces the item indicated by the idx argument. |
| 2 | Next call to `add_list `appends a new item after the item indicated by the idx argument. If an index isn't provided, the new item is appended after the last item in the list. |
| 3 | Items in the list are cleared and a new item is appended. |

After a tile key, mode, and index have been specified with the `start_list` function, you can change or add new items with the `add_list` function. The `add_list` function accepts a single argument of a string value. This value is the text that will be displayed in the list of the `list_box` or `popup_list` tile. If the value is successfully added to the list, the string passed to the `add_list` function is returned; otherwise, nil is returned, indicating the item wasn't added.

Once you have modified a list, use the `end_list` function. The `end_list` ends the modification of the list that was started with the `start_list` function. The `end_list` function returns a value of nil regardless of whether the list was successfully modified.

The following code shows how to replace and assign a list of two values to a `popup_list` tile with the key of `list_layers`. The `list_layers` key refers to the Layer To Place Object On `popup_list` tile of the `ex_createLabelObject` dialog definition you created in the「Creating and Previewing a Dialog in a DCL File」section.

```c

(start_list "list_layers" 2)
; Add two items that represent the layers to allow
(add_list "A-Door")
(add_list "A-Window")
; End list modification
(end_list)
```

NOTE: The `set_tile` and `mode_tile` functions shouldn't be executed between the use of the `start_list` and `end_list` functions. Execute the `start_list` and `end_list` functions before the `start_dialog` function to ensure that the list is updated before the dialog box is displayed.

### 0310. 任意卡 —— 创建实体数据的 2 个方法

The command function is the most common method that AutoLISP programmers use to create and modify objects, but it isn't the most efficient when you are trying to modify individual properties of an object. Even creating lots of objects in the Autodesk® AutoCAD® program can be slower with the command function. Along with the command function, objects can be created and modified directly by setting property values as part of an entity data list. Extended data (XData) can also be attached to an object as a way to differentiate one object from another or, in some cases, to affect the way an object might look in the drawing area.

1-2『直接用 command，自己就遇到了瓶颈。1）确实效率低下。2）自动生成辅助流程组件，插进来的块，位置经常不是均匀的，目前一直找到不解决办法。正巧这里受到启发，改用直接创建实体数据的方法实现自动生成块。待实现。做一张任意卡片。（2020-10-29）回复：已经实现了，而且用起来真舒服，详见数据流的源码。（2020-11-26）补充：目前已习得通过 ActiveX 技术来生成 CAD 实体对象，详见数据流源码。（2021-03-22）』

Using AutoLISP, you can create a table using the entmake function while modifying and populating the table with the entget and entmod functions.

### 0311. 任意卡 —— 获取实体数据信息

除了用选择集的方式，先获得选择集，通过选择集获取各个实体的实体名，再通过实体名获得实体的数据集。也可以通过下面的方式直接获取实体数据集（直接用 `entlast` 和 `entnext` 这些函数获取实体名，然后调 `entget` 获取数据集）。两种方法的区别在于如何获得实体名，一个是靠用户选择（选择集），一个是全部在后台完成。（2020-11-26）

AutoLISP provides two different techniques that can be used to select an individual object within a drawing — through code or via user interaction. When you want to work with the most recent object or step through all of the objects in a drawing, you don't need any input from the user. The AutoLISP functions entlast and entnext can be used to get an individual object without any input from the user. If you do want to allow the user to interactively select an individual object, you can use the entsel and nentsel functions.

The entlast function returns the entity name of the last graphical object added to a drawing and doesn't require any arguments. This function can be helpful in getting the entity name for a new object created with the entmake function.

```c
; Create an arc with a center point of -1,1, radius of 1.5,
; a start angle of 315, and end angle of 135
(entmake '((0. "ARC")(10 -1.0 1.0 0.0)(40. 1.5)(50. 5.49779)(51. 2.35619)))
((0. "ARC") (10 -1.0 1.0 0.0) (40. 1.41421) (50. 5.49779) (51. 2.35619))
(setq entityName (entlast))
<Entity name: 7ff72292cc10>
```

The entnext function allows you to traverse a drawing from the first drawn to most recently added graphical object. When entnext is called without an argument, it returns the ename of the oldest graphical object in the drawing. If the function is passed a valid ename, the ename of the object drawn after the one passed to the function is returned. The following shows the syntax of the entnext function:

```c
(entnext [ename])
```

The ename argument is optional and represents the entity name of an object. The function returns the name of the next object in the drawing. When no ename argument is provided, the entity name of the first graphical object in the drawing is returned.

The following example code uses the entnext function to step through and list the type of each object in the current drawing:

```c
; Lists the DXF group code 0 value for each object in the drawing
(defun c:listobjects ( / )
  (prompt "\nObjects in this drawing:")
  (setq entityName (entnext))
  (while entityName
    (prompt (strcat "\n" (cdr (assoc 0 (entget entityName)))))
    (setq entityName (entnext entityName))
  )
  (princ)
)

Objects in this drawing:
CIRCLE
DIMENSION
DIMENSION
INSERT
ATTRIB
SEQEND
CIRCLE
VIEWPORT
VIEWPORT
CIRCLE
DIMENSION
ARC
```

The previous example used the entget function to return an entity data list of an object. I explain how to use this function later, in the「Updating an Object's Properties with an Entity Data List」section.

1-2『这个例子看下来后，entlast、entnext 还有 entget 这几个函数结合起来可以做好多事，特别是 entnext 的用法灵活性很大。比如自动生成辅助流程里，又想到一个思路：1）先直接使用 entlast 获取图纸里的最后一个实体名保存下来。2）批量插入辅助流程组件块后，通过刚刚最后一个实体名外加 entnext 函数，可以获得所有批量插入的块的实体名列表。3）根据这个实体名列表批量修改属性值，这样又跟以前开发好的功能对接上了。把上面信息合并到「获取实体数据集的方式」任意卡里。补充：还有一种思路，生成实体对象后直接用函数 `entlast` 获取其 entity name 存起来。（2021-03-12）』—— 已完成

### 0312. 任意卡 —— Controlling a Command's Version

Internally each standard AutoCAD command is assigned a new version number when a change is made that affects an AutoLISP program, script, or command macro. You use the initcommandversion function to control which version of a command is used by the next use of the command or command-s function. The initcommandversion function doesn't require a value, but when one is provided it must be an integer value that represents the version of the command you want to use.

The following example uses version 1 of the color command:

```c
(initcommandversion 1)
(command "._color")
```

Version 1 of the color command displays options at the Command prompt; version 2 or later displays the Select Color dialog box instead. The -insert command is another command that is affected by the initcommandversion function. When using version 2 of the -insert command, the user can interact with the AutoCAD Properties palette in Windows while a preview of the block is being dragged in the drawing area.

## Introduction

In 1996, Lee began learning the core concepts of customizing the AutoCAD user interface and AutoLISP. The introduction of VBA in AutoCAD R14 would once again redefine how Lee approached programming solutions for AutoCAD. VBA made it much easier to communicate with external databases and other applications that supported VBA. It transformed the way information could be moved between project management and manufacturing systems.

Not being content with VBA, in 1999 Lee attended his first Autodesk University and began to learn ObjectARX®. Autodesk University had a lasting impression on him. In 2001, he started helping as a lab assistant. He began presenting on customizing and programming AutoCAD at the event in 2004. Along the way he learned how to use the AutoCAD Managed.NET API.

Customization is one of the feature areas that sets AutoCAD apart from many other CAD programs. Even though the product can be used out of the box, configuring the user interface and modifying the support files that come with the product can greatly improve your productivity. By customizing AutoCAD, you can streamline product workflows and create new ones that are a better fit with the way your company works. These workflows might range from importing layers and styles into a drawing to the extraction of drawing-based information into a spreadsheet or database.

The AutoLISP programming language can be used to: Create custom functions that can be executed from the AutoCAD Command prompt; Create and manipulate graphical objects in a drawing, such as lines, circles, and arcs; Create and manipulate nongraphical objects in a drawing, such as layers, dimension styles, and named views; Perform mathematical and geometric calculations; Request input from or display messages to the user at the Command prompt; Interact with files and directories in the operating system; Read from and write to external files; Connect to applications that support ActiveX and COM; Display dialog boxes and get input from the end user.

AutoLISP code can be entered directly at the Command prompt or loaded using a LSP file. Once an AutoLISP program has been loaded, you can execute the custom functions from the Command prompt. Functions executed from the Command prompt can be similar to standard AutoCAD commands, but the programmer determines the prompts that should be displayed. It is also possible to use AutoLISP code with a command macro that is activated from the AutoCAD user interface or a tool on a tool palette.

1『 VBA 能实现的功能同上。追加：这里的宏 macro 跟原生 lisp 语言里的 macro 有啥联系？（2020-11-26）』

VBA code statements are entered into the Visual Basic Editor and stored in a DVB file. Once a VBA project has been loaded, you can execute the macros through the Macros dialog box. Unlike standard AutoCAD commands, macros cannot be executed from the Command prompt, but once executed, a macro can prompt users for values at the Command prompt or with a user form. It is possible to execute a macro from a command macro that is activated with a command button displayed in the AutoCAD user interface or as a tool on a tool palette.

### Part I: AutoCAD Customization: Increasing Productivity through Personalization

Chapter 1: Establishing the Foundation for Drawing Standards In this chapter, you'll learn how to establish drawing standards. Drawing standards allow you to enforce consistency across multiple drawings. By enforcing a set of standards, you can easily share your drawings and make them look the same when plotting them.

Chapter 2: Working with Nongraphical Objects In this chapter, you'll learn how nongraphical objects affect display and output of objects in a drawing. Nongraphical objects such as layers and text styles make it easy to update the look of all the objects that reference them.

Chapter 3: Building the Real World One Block at a Time In this chapter, you'll learn how to create and manage blocks. Blocks allow you to logically create object groupings that can be used several times in the same drawing. For example, you could create a small assembly of parts and insert it more than once in a drawing. If the assembly changes, you just need to update the block and all instances of that block are changed.

Chapter 4: Manipulating the Drawing Environment In this chapter, you'll learn how to change the AutoCAD drawing environment. During start up, you can control several of the settings that affect the AutoCAD program. These settings can affect the display of the user interface, behavior of tools in the drawing environment, and where AutoCAD looks for support files.

Chapter 5: Customizing the AutoCAD User Interface for Windows In this chapter, you'll learn how to customize the elements and display of the AutoCAD user interface on Windows. The Customize User Interface (CUI) Editor allows you to create and manage the tools that are displayed by the AutoCAD user interface.

Chapter 6: Customizing the AutoCAD User Interface for Mac In this chapter, you'll learn how to customize the elements and display of the AutoCAD user interface on Mac OS. The Customize dialog box allows you to create and manage the tools displayed by the AutoCAD user interface.

Chapter 7: Creating Tools and Tool Palettes In this chapter, you'll learn how to create and customize tool palettes in AutoCAD on Windows. Tool palettes allow you to create a visual set of tools that can be used to insert blocks, start commands, or even hatch a closed area. Tool palettes are available on Windows only.

Chapter 8: Automating Repetitive Tasks In this chapter, you will learn how to create scripts and action macros to automate repetitive tasks. Script files and action macros allow you to combine multiple commands into simple logical sequences without needing to know a programming language. Action macros are supported on Windows only.

Chapter 9: Defining Shapes, Linetypes, and Hatch Patterns In this chapter, you will learn how to create custom shapes, linetypes, and hatch patterns that you can use to control the way line work appears in a drawing. The AutoCAD install provides a limited number of standard shapes, linetypes, and hatch patterns. You can extend the standard definitions by creating your own shapes, linetypes, and hatch patterns for use in your drawings.

Chapter 10: Using, Loading, and Managing Custom Files In this chapter, you will learn how to use, manage, and migrate custom files. After you have spent the time customizing AutoCAD, all you have left to do is deploy and manage your files.

### Part II: AutoLISP: Productivity through Programming

Chapter 11: Quick Start for New AutoLISP Programmers In this chapter, you'll get an introduction to the AutoLISP programming language. I begin by showing you how to enter AutoLISP expressions at the Command prompt and execute standard AutoCAD commands. After that, you are eased into some basic programming concepts that allow you to perform conditional tests and repeat expressions. The chapter wraps up with creating and loading an AutoLISP file into the AutoCAD program.

Chapter 12: Understanding AutoLISP In this chapter, you'll learn the fundamentals of the AutoLISP programming language. AutoLISP fundamentals include a look at the syntax and structure of an expression, how to use a function, and how to work with variables. Beyond just syntax and variables, you learn to use AutoCAD commands and group multiple AutoLISP expressions into custom functions.

Chapter 13: Calculating and Working with Values In this chapter, you'll learn to work with mathematical and string manipulation functions. Math functions allow you to perform basic and advanced calculations based on object values or a value that the user might provide, whereas string manipulation functions allow you to work with text-based values. Both numeric and textual values are used when creating or manipulating objects, adding annotations to a drawing, or displaying a message to the end user. Based on how the values are used, numeric values can be converted to strings and strings can be converted to numeric values.

Chapter 14: Working with Lists In this chapter, you'll learn to work with the list data type. Lists are used throughout AutoLISP to provide 2D or 3D coordinate values or to define an object stored in a drawing.

Chapter 15: Requesting Input, and Using Conditional and Looping Expressions In this chapter, you'll learn to request input from the user, use conditional statements, and repeat expressions. Requesting input allows you to get values from the user and then use those values to determine the end result of the program. Conditional statements enable a program to make choices based on known conditions in a drawing or input from a user. After you understand conditional statements, you will learn to use them in conjunction with looping expressions to execute a set of expressions until a condition is met.

Chapter 16: Creating and Modifying Graphical Objects In this chapter, you'll learn how to create, modify, and attach extended data to graphical objects using AutoCAD commands and AutoLISP functions. Graphical objects represent the drawing objects, such as a line, an arc, or a circle, that are displayed in model space or on a named layout. When modifying objects, you can choose to step through all the objects in a drawing or let the user select the objects to be modified. Extended data allows you to store information with an object that can be used to identify the objects your program creates or link objects to external database records.

Chapter 17: Creating and Modifying Nongraphical Objects In this chapter, you'll learn how to create and modify nongraphical objects using AutoCAD commands and AutoLISP functions. Nongraphical objects are used to control the appearance of graphical objects and store settings that affect the behavior of features in the AutoCAD program. Drawings support two different types of nongraphical objects: symbol table objects and dictionaries.

Chapter 18: Working with the Operating System and External Files In this chapter, you will learn how to work with settings and files stored outside of the AutoCAD program. Settings can be stored in the Windows Registry and Plist files on Mac OS, and they can be used to affect the behavior of the AutoCAD program or persist values for your custom programs between AutoCAD sessions. Files and folders stored in the operating system can be accessed and manipulated from the AutoCAD program, which allows you to set up project folders or populate project information in the title block of a drawing from an external file.

Chapter 19: Catching and Handling Errors In this chapter, you will learn how to catch and handle errors that are caused by an AutoLISP function and keep an AutoLISP program from terminating early. AutoLISP provides functions that allow you to trace a function, see arguments as they are passed, catch an error and determine how it should be handled, and group functions together so all the actions performed can be rolled back as a single operation.

Chapter 20: Authoring, Managing, and Loading AutoLISP Programs In this chapter, you will learn how to store AutoLISP code statements in a file, load and manage AutoLISP files, and deploy custom programs with plug-in bundles. Storing AutoLISP code in a file allows for its reuse in multiple drawings. When you load an AutoLISP file, all of the functions defined in the file are made available while the drawing remains open. Based on how you load or deploy an AutoLISP file, you might need to let the AutoCAD program know where your AutoLISP files are stored.

Chapter 21: Using the Visual LISP Editor (Windows only) In this chapter, you will learn how to use the Visual LISP® Editor. The editor provides tools for writing, formatting, validating, and debugging code in an AutoLISP file. Using the Visual LISP Editor, you can group AutoLISP files into project files, which make them easy to manage and compile. Compiling an AutoLISP file secures the source code contained in the file so that it can't be altered by others.

Chapter 22: Working with ActiveX/COM Libraries (Windows only) In this chapter, you will learn how to use ActiveX/COM libraries with AutoLISP. ActiveX provides access to additional functions, which allow for the creation and manipulation of drawing objects and AutoCAD application settings that aren't easily accessible with standard AutoLISP functions. External applications, such as Microsoft Word and Excel, can also be accessed from the AutoCAD program when using ActiveX.

Chapter 23: Implementing Dialog Boxes (Windows only) In this chapter, you will learn how to create and use dialog boxes with an AutoLISP program. Dialog boxes provide an alternative method of requesting input from the user and are implemented using Dialog Control Language (DCL).

### Part III: AutoCAD VBA: Programming with VBA and ActiveX (Windows only)

Chapter 24: Understanding the AutoCAD VBA Environment In this chapter, you'll get an introduction to the Visual Basic Editor. I begin by showing you how to verify whether the VBA environment for AutoCAD has been installed and, if not, how to install it. After that, you are eased into navigating the Visual Basic Editor and managing VBA programs. The chapter wraps up with learning how to execute macros and access the help documentation.

Chapter 25: Understanding Visual Basic for Applications In this chapter, you'll learn the fundamentals of the VBA programming language and how to work with objects. VBA fundamentals include a look at the syntax and structure of a statement, how to use a function, and how to work with variables. Beyond syntax and variables, you learn to group multiple statements into custom procedure.

Chapter 26: Interacting with the Application and Documents Objects In this chapter, you'll learn to work with the AutoCAD application and manage documents. Many of the tasks you perform with an AutoCAD VBA program require you to work with either the application or a document. For example, you can get the objects in a drawing and even access end-user preferences. Although you typically work with the current document, VBA allows you to work with all open documents and create new documents. From the current document, you can execute commands and work with system variables from within a VBA program, which allows you to leverage and apply your knowledge of working with commands and system variables.

Chapter 27: Creating and Modifying Drawing Objects In this chapter, you'll learn to create and modify graphical objects in model space with VBA. Graphical objects represent the drawing objects, such as a line, an arc, or a circle. The methods and properties of an object are used to modify and obtain information about the object. When working with the objects in a drawing, you can get a single object or step through all objects in a drawing.

Chapter 28: Interacting with the User and Controlling the Current View In this chapter, you'll learn to request input from an end-user and manipulate the current view of a drawing. Based on the values provided by the end-user, you can then determine the end result of the program. You can evaluate the objects created or consider how a drawing will be output, and use that information to create named views and adjust the current view in which objects are displayed.

Chapter 29: Annotating Objects In this chapter, you'll learn how to create and modify annotation objects. Typically, annotation objects are not part of the final product that is built or manufactured based on the design in the drawing. Rather, annotation objects are used to communicate the features and measurements of a design. Annotation can be a single line of text that is used as a callout for a leader, a dimension that indicates the distance between two drill holes, or a table that contains quantities and information about the windows and doors in a design.

Chapter 30: Working with Blocks and External References In this chapter, you'll learn how to create, modify, and manage block definitions. Model space in a drawing is a special named block definition, so working with block definitions will feel familiar. Once you create a block definition, you will learn how to insert a block reference and work with attributes along with dynamic properties. You complete the chapter by learning how to work with externally referenced files.

Chapter 31: Outputting Drawings In this chapter, you will learn how to output the graphical objects in model space or on a named layout to a printer, plotter, or electronic file. Named layouts will be used to organize graphical objects for output, including title blocks, annotation, floating viewports, and many others. Floating viewports will be used to control the display of objects from model space on a layout at a specific scale. After you define and configure a layout, you learn to plot and preview a layout. The chapter wraps up with learning how to export and import file formats.

Chapter 32: Storing and Retrieving Custom Data In this chapter, you will learn how to store custom information in a drawing or in the Windows Registry. Using extended data (Xdata), you will be able to store information that can be used to identify a graphical object created by your program or define a link to a record in an external database. In addition to attaching information to an object, you can store data in a custom dictionary that isn't attached to a specific graphical object in a drawing. Both Xdata and custom dictionaries can be helpful in making information available between drawing sessions; the Windows Registry can persist data between sessions.
