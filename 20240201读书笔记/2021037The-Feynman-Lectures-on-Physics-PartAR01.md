20 世纪 60 年代初，美国一些理工科大学鉴于当时的大学基础物理教学与现代科学技术的发展不相适应，纷纷试行教学改革，加利福尼亚理工学院就是其中之一。该校于 1961 年 9 月至 1963 年 5 月特请著名物理学家费恩曼主讲一二年级的基础物理课，事后又根据讲课录音编辑出版了《费恩曼物理学讲义》。本讲义共分 3 卷，第 1 卷包括力学、相对论、光学气体分子动理论、热力学、波等，第 2 卷主要是电磁学，第 3 卷是量子力学。全书内容十分丰富，在深度和广度上都超过了传统的普通物理教材。

当时美国大学物理教学改革试图解决的一个主要问题是基础物理教学应尽可能反映近代物理的巨大成就。《费恩曼物理学讲义》在基础物理的水平上对 20 世纪物理学的两大重要成就 一一 相对论和量子力学作了系统的介绍，对于量子力学，费恩曼教授还特地准备了一套适合大学二年级水平的讲法。教学改革试图解决的另一个问题是按照当前物理学工作者在各个前沿研究领域所使用的方式来介绍物理学的内容。在《费恩曼物理学讲义》一书中对一些问题的分析和处理方法反映了费恩曼自己以及其他在前沿研究领域工作的物理学家所通常采用的分析和处理方法。全书对基本概念、定理和定律的讲解不仅生动清晰，通俗易懂，而且特别注重从物理上作出深刻的叙述。为了扩大学生的知识面，全书还列举了许多基本物理原理在各个方面（诸如天体物理、地球物理、生物物理等）的应用，以及物理学的些最新成就。由于全书是根据课堂讲授的录音整理编辑的，它在一定程度保留了费恩曼讲课的生动活泼、引人入胜的独特风格。

《费恩曼物理学讲义》从普通物理水平出发，注重物理分析，深入浅出，避免运用高深繁琐的数学方程，因此具有高中以上物理水平和初等微积分知识的读者阅读起来不会感到十分困难。至于大学物理系的师生和物理工作者更能从此书中获得教益。

1989 年，为纪念费恩曼逝世一周年，原书编者重新出版本书，并增加了介绍费恩曼生平的短文和新的序言。2010 年，编者根据五十多年来世界各国在阅读和使用本书过程中提出的意见，对全书（三卷）存在的错误和不当之处（885 处）进行了订正，并使用新的电子版语言和现代作图软件对全书语言文字、符号、方程及插图进行重新编辑出版，称为新千年版。本书就是根据新千年版翻译的。

## About Richard Feynman

Born in 1918 in New York City, Richard P. Feynman received his Ph.D. from Princeton in 1942. Despite his youth, he played an important part in the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos during World War II. Subsequently, he taught at Cornell and at the California Institute of Technology. In 1965 he received the Nobel Prize in Physics, along with Sin-Itiro Tomonaga and Julian Schwinger, for his work in quantum electrodynamics.

Dr. Feynman won his Nobel Prize for successfully resolving problems with the theory of quantum electrodynamics. He also created a mathematical theory that accounts for the phenomenon of superﬂuidity in liquid helium. Thereafter, with Murray Gell-Mann, he did fundamental work in the area of weak interactions such as beta decay. In later years Feynman played a key role in the development of quark theory by putting forward his parton model of high energy proton collision processes.

Beyond these achievements, Dr. Feynman introduced basic new computational techniques and notations into physics — above all, the ubiquitous Feynman diagrams that, perhaps more than any other formalism in recent scientiﬁc history, have changed the way in which basic physical processes are conceptualized and calculated.

Feynman was a remarkably eﬀective educator. Of all his numerous awards, he was especially proud of the Oersted Medal for Teaching, which he won in 1972. The Feynman Lectures on Physics, originally published in 1963, were described by a reviewer in Scientiﬁc American as「tough, but nourishing and full of ﬂavor. After 25 years it is the guide for teachers and for the best of beginning students.」In order to increase the understanding of physics among the lay public, Dr. Feynman wrote The Character of Physical Law and QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter. He also authored a number of advanced publications that have become classic references and textbooks for researchers and students. 

Richard Feynman was a constructive public man. His work on the Challenger commission is well known, especially his famous demonstration of the susceptibility of the O-rings to cold, an elegant experiment which required nothing more than a glass of ice water and a C-clamp. Less well known were Dr. Feynman's eﬀorts on the California State Curriculum Committee in the 1960s, where he protested the mediocrity of textbooks.

A recital of Richard Feynman's myriad scientiﬁc and educational accomplishments cannot adequately capture the essence of the man. As any reader of even his most technical publications knows, Feynman's lively and multi-sided personality shines through all his work. Besides being a physicist, he was at various times a repairer of radios, a picker of locks, an artist, a dancer, a bongo player, and even a decipherer of Mayan Hieroglyphics. Perpetually curious about his world, he was an exemplary empiricist.

Richard Feynman died on February 15, 1988, in Los Angeles.

2『费曼，做一张人名卡。（2021-01-17）』—— 未完成

理査德·费恩曼（R. P. Feynman）1918 年生于纽约市，1942 年在普林斯顿大学获得博士学位。第二次世界大战期间，尽管当时他还很年轻，就已经在洛斯阿拉莫斯的曼哈顿计划中发挥了重要作用。以后，他在康奈尔大学和加利福尼亚理工学院任教。1965 年，因在量子电动力学方面的工作和朝永振一郎及施温格尔（J. Schwinger）同获诺贝尔物理学奖。

费恩曼博获得诺贝尔奖是由于成功地解决了量子电动力学的理论问题。他也创立了说明液氨中超流动性现象的数学理论。此后，他和盖尔曼（M Gell-mann）一起在 β 衰变等弱相互作用领域内做出了莫基性的工作。在以后的几年里，他在夸克理论的发展中起了关键性的作用，提出了高能质子碰撞过程的部分子模型。

除了这些成就之外，费恩曼博士将新的基本计算技术及记号法引进物理学，首先是无处不在的费恩曼图，在近代科学历史中，它比任何其他数学形式描述都更大地改变了对基本物理过程形成概念及进行计算的方法。

费恩曼是一位卓越的教育家。在他获得的所有奖项中，他对 1972 年获得的奥斯特教学奖章特别感到自豪。在 1963 年第一次出版的《费恩曼物理学讲义》被《科学美国人》杂志的位评论员描写为「难啃的但却富于营养并且津津有味。25 年后它仍是教师和最优秀的初学学生的指导书」。为了使外行的公众增加对物理学的了解，费恩曼博士写了《物理定律和量子电动力学的性质：光和物质的奇特理论》。他还是许多高级出版物的作者，这些都成为研究人员和学生的经典参考书和教科书。

费恩曼是一个活跃的公众人物。他在挑战者号调査委员会里的工作是众所周知的，特别是他的著名的 O 型环对寒冷的敏感性的演示，这是一个优美的实验，除了一杯冰水和 O 形钳以外其他什么也不需要。费恩曼博士 1960 年在加利福尼亚州课程促进会中的工作却很少人知道，他在会上指责教科书的平庸。

仅仅罗列费恩曼的科学和教育成就还没有充分抓住这个人物的本质。即使是他的最最技术性的出版物的读者都知道，费恩曼活跃的多面的人格在他所有的工作中都闪闪发光。除了作为物理学家，在各种不同的时候：他是无线电修理工，是锁具收藏家、艺术家、舞蹈家、邦戈（bongo）鼓手，以至玛雅象形文字的破译者。他的世界是永远的好奇，他是一个典型的经验主义者。

费恩曼于 1988 年 2 月 15 日在洛杉矶逝世

## Preface to the New Millennium Edition

Nearly ﬁfty years have passed since Richard Feynman taught the introductory physics course at Caltech that gave rise to these three volumes, The Feynman Lectures on Physics. In those ﬁfty years our understanding of the physical world has changed greatly, but The Feynman Lectures on Physics has endured. Feynman's lectures are as powerful today as when ﬁrst published, thanks to Feynman's unique physics insights and pedagogy. They have been studied worldwide by novices and mature physicists alike; they have been translated into at least a dozen languages with more than 1.5 millions copies printed in the English language alone. Perhaps no other set of physics books has had such wide impact, for so long.

This New Millennium Edition ushers in a new era for The Feynman Lectures on Physics (FLP): the twenty-ﬁrst century era of electronic publishing. FLP has been converted to eFLP, with the text and equations expressed in the LATEX electronic typesetting language, and all ﬁgures redone using modern drawing software.

The consequences for the print version of this edition are not startling; it looks almost the same as the original red books that physics students have known and loved for decades. The main diﬀerences are an expanded and improved index, the correction of 885 errata found by readers over the ﬁve years since the ﬁrst printing of the previous edition, and the ease of correcting errata that future readers may ﬁnd. To this I shall return below.

The eBook Version of this edition, and the Enhanced Electronic Version are electronic innovations. By contrast with most eBook versions of 20th century technical books, whose equations, ﬁgures and sometimes even text become pixellated when one tries to enlarge them, the LATEX manuscript of the New Millennium Edition makes it possible to create eBooks of the highest quality, in which all features on the page (except photographs) can be enlarged without bound and retain their precise shapes and sharpness. And the Enhanced Electronic Version, with its audio and blackboard photos from Feynman's original lectures, and its links to other resources, is an innovation that would have given Feynman great pleasure.

自理査德·费恩曼在加利福尼亚理工学院讲授物理学导论课程以来，已经过去快 50 年了。这次讲课产生了这三卷《费恩曼物理学讲义》。在这 50 年中，我们对物理世界的认识已经大大改变了，但是《费恩曼物理学讲义》的价值仍旧存在。由于费恩曼对物理学独到的领悟和教学方法，费恩曼的讲义今天仍像第一次出版时那样具有权威性。这些教本已在全世界范围内被初学者，也被成熟的物理学家研读；它们已被翻译成至少 12 种语言，仅仅英语的印刷就有 150 万册以上。或许至今为止还没有其他物理学书籍有这样广泛的影响。

新千年版迎来了《费恩曼物理学讲义（FLP）》的新时代：21 世纪的电子出版物时代 FLP 改变为 eFLP，本文和方程式用 X 电子排字语言表示，所有的插图用现代绘图软件重画。

这一版的印刷本的效果并没有什么特别之处，它看上去几乎完全和学物理的学生都已熟悉并热爱的最初的红色书一样。主要的差别在于扩大并改进了的素引，以前的版本第次印刷以来的 50 年内读者们发现的 885 篇错误的改正，以及改正未来的读者可能发现的错误的便利。关于这一点我以后还要谈到。

这一版的电子书版本以及加强电子版不同于 20 世纪的大多数技术书籍的电子书，如果把这种书籍的方程式、插图、有时甚至包括课文，放大以后都成为多个像素。新干年版的上稿本有可能得到最高质量的电子书，书页上的所有的面貌特征（除了照片）都可以无限制地放大而始终保持其精确的形状和细锐度。带有费恩曼原初讲课的声音和黑板照相、还带有和其他资源的联接的加强电子版是新事物，（假如费恩曼还在世的话）这一定会使他极其高兴。

### 01. Memories of Feynman's Lectures

These three volumes are a self-contained pedagogical treatise. They are also a historical record of Feynman's 1961–1964 undergraduate physics lectures, a course required of all Caltech freshmen and sophomores regardless of their majors.

Readers may wonder, as I have, how Feynman's lectures impacted the students who attended them. Feynman, in his Preface to these volumes, oﬀered a somewhat negative view.「I don't think I did very well by the students,」he wrote. Matthew Sands, in his memoir in Feynman's Tips on Physics expressed a far more positive view. Out of curiosity, in spring 2005 I emailed or talked to a quasi-random set of 17 students (out of about 150) from Feynman's 1961–1963 class — some who had great diﬃculty with the class, and some who mastered it with ease; majors in biology, chemistry, engineering, geology, mathematics and astronomy, as well as in physics.

The intervening years might have glazed their memories with a euphoric tint, but about 80 percent recall Feynman's lectures as highlights of their college years.「It was like going to church.」The lectures were「a transformational experience,」「the experience of a lifetime, probably the most important thing I got from Caltech.」「I was a biology major but Feynman's lectures stand out as a high point in my undergraduate experience.....though I must admit I couldn't do the homework at the time and I hardly turned any of it in.」「I was among the least promising of students in this course, and I never missed a lecture..... I remember and can still feel Feynman's joy of discovery..... His lectures had an . . . emotional impact that was probably lost in the printed Lectures.」By contrast, several of the students have negative memories due largely to two issues: 1)「You couldn't learn to work the homework problems by attending the lectures. Feynman was too slick — he knew tricks and what approximations could be made, and had intuition based on experience and genius that a beginning student does not possess.」Feynman and colleagues, aware of this ﬂaw in the course, addressed it in part with materials that have been incorporated into Feynman's Tips on Physics: three problem-solving lectures by Feynman, and a set of exercises and answers assembled by Robert B. Leighton and Rochus Vogt. 2)「The insecurity of not knowing what was likely to be discussed in the next lecture, the lack of a text book or reference with any connection to the lecture material, and consequent inability for us to read ahead, were very frustrating...... I found the lectures exciting and understandable in the hall, but they were Sanskrit outside [when I tried to reconstruct the details].」This problem, of course, was solved by these three volumes, the printed version of The Feynman Lectures on Physics. They became the textbook from which Caltech students studied for many years thereafter, and they live on today as one of Feynman's greatest legacies.

费恩曼讲义的回忆

这三卷书是一套完备的教科书。它们也是费恩曼在 1961-1964 年给本科生上物理学课的历史记录，这是加利福尼亚理工学院的一年级和二年级学生，无论他们主修什么课程，都必须上的一门课。

读者们可能和我一样很想知道，费恩曼的讲课对听课的学生的影响如何。费恩曼在这几本书的前言中提供了多少有些负面的看法。他写道：「我不认为我对学生做得很好」。马修·桑玆在他的《费恩曼物理学指导手册》的回忆文章中给出了完全正面的观点。出于好奇，2005 年春天，我和从费恩曼 1961-1964 班级（大约 150 个学生）中半随机地挑选一组 17 位学生通过电子邮件或面谈联系 一一 这些学生中有些在课堂上有很大的困难，而有一些很容易掌握课程；他们主修生物学、化学、工程、地理学、数学及天文学，还包括物理学。

经过了这些年，可能已经在他们的记忆中抹上了欣快的色彩，但大约有 80% 回忆起费恩曼的讲课觉得是他们大学时光中精彩的事件。「就像上教堂。」听课是「一个变形改造的经历」，「一生的重要阅历，或许是我从加利福尼亚理工学院得到的最重要的东西。」「我是一个主修生物学的学生，但费恩曼的讲课在我的本科生经历中就像在最高点一样突出…… 虽然我必须承认当时我不会做家庭作业并且总是交不出作业。」「我当时是课堂上最没有希望的学生之一，但我从不缺一堂课…… 我记得并仍旧感党到费恩曼对于发现的快乐… 他的讲课具有一种… 感情上的冲击效果，这在印刷的讲义中可能失去了。」

相反，好些学生，主要由于以下两方面问题，而具有负面的记忆。1）「你无法通过上课学会做家庭作业。费恩曼太灵活了 一一 他熟知解题技巧和可以作哪些近似，他还具有基于经验和天赋的直觉，这是初学的学生所不具备的。」费恩曼和同事们在讲课过程中知道这缺陷，做了一些工作，部分材料已编入《费恩曼物理学指导手册》：费恩曼的三次习题课以及罗伯特·菜顿和罗各斯·沃格特（Rochus Vogt）选编的一组习题和答案。2）由于不知道下一节课可能会讨论什么内容，产生一种不安全感，缺少与讲课内容有任何关系的教科书或参者书，其结果是我们无法预习，这是十分令人丧气的...… 我发现在课堂上的演讲是令人激动但却是很难懂，但（当我重建这些细节的时候发现）它们只是外表上像梵文一样难懂。当然，有了这三本《费恩曼物理学讲义》，这些问题已经得到了解决。从那以后的许多年，它们就成了加州理工学院学生学习的教科书，直到今天它们作为费恩曼的伟大遗产还保持着活力。

### 02. A History of Errata

The Feynman Lectures on Physics was produced very quickly by Feynman and his co-authors, Robert B. Leighton and Matthew Sands, working from and expanding on tape recordings and blackboard photos of Feynman's course lectures* (both of which are incorporated into the Enhanced Electronic Version of this New Millennium Edition). Given the high speed at which Feynman, Leighton and Sands worked, it was inevitable that many errors crept into the ﬁrst edition. Feynman accumulated long lists of claimed errata over the subsequent years — errata found by students and faculty at Caltech and by readers around the world. In the 1960's and early 70's, Feynman made time in his intense life to check most but not all of the claimed errata for Volumes I and II, and insert corrections into subsequent printings. But Feynman's sense of duty never rose high enough above the excitement of discovering new things to make him deal with the errata in Volume III.† After his untimely death in 1988, lists of errata for all three volumes were deposited in the Caltech Archives, and there they lay forgotten.

In 2002 Ralph Leighton (son of the late Robert Leighton and compatriot of Feynman) informed me of the old errata and a new long list compiled by Ralph's friend Michael Gottlieb. Leighton proposed that Caltech produce a new edition of The Feynman Lectures with all errata corrected, and publish it alongside a new volume of auxiliary material, Feynman's Tips on Physics, which he and Gottlieb were preparing. Feynman was my hero and a close personal friend. When I saw the lists of errata and the content of the proposed new volume, I quickly agreed to oversee this project on behalf of Caltech (Feynman's long-time academic home, to which he, Leighton and Sands had entrusted all rights and responsibilities for The Feynman Lectures). After a year and a half of meticulous work by Gottlieb, and careful scrutiny by Dr. Michael Hartl (an outstanding Caltech postdoc who vetted all errata plus the new volume), the 2005 Deﬁnitive Edition of The Feynman Lectures on Physics was born, with about 200 errata corrected and accompanied by Feynman's Tips on Physics by Feynman, Gottlieb and Leighton. I thought that edition was going to be「Deﬁnitive」. What I did not antic- ipate was the enthusiastic response of readers around the world to an appeal from Gottlieb to identify further errata, and submit them via a website that Gottlieb created and continues to maintain, The Feynman Lectures Website, www.feynmanlectures.info. In the ﬁve years since then, 965 new errata have been submitted and survived the meticulous scrutiny of Gottlieb, Hartl, and Nate Bode (an outstanding Caltech physics graduate student, who succeeded Hartl as Caltech's vetter of errata). Of these, 965 vetted errata, 80 were corrected in the fourth printing of the Deﬁnitive Edition (August 2006) and the remaining 885 are corrected in the ﬁrst printing of this New Millennium Edition (332 in volume I, 263 in volume II, and 200 in volume III). For details of the errata, see www.feynmanlectures.info. Clearly, making The Feynman Lectures on Physics error-free has become a world-wide community enterprise. On behalf of Caltech I thank the 50 readers who have contributed since 2005 and the many more who may contribute over the coming years. The names of all contributors are posted at www.feynmanlectures. info/flp_errata.html. Almost all the errata have been of three types: (i) typographical errors in prose; (ii) typographical and mathematical errors in equations, tables and ﬁgures — sign errors, incorrect numbers (e.g., a 5 that should be a 4), and missing subscripts, summation signs, parentheses and terms in equations; (iii) incorrect cross references to chapters, tables and ﬁgures. These kinds of errors, though not terribly serious to a mature physicist, can be frustrating and confusing to Feynman's primary audience: students.

It is remarkable that among the 1165 errata corrected under my auspices, only several do I regard as true errors in physics. An example is Volume II, page 5-9, which now says「. . . no static distribution of charges inside a closed grounded conductor can produce any [electric] ﬁelds outside」(the word grounded was omitted in previous editions). This error was pointed out to Feynman by a number of readers, including Beulah Elizabeth Cox, a student at The College of William and Mary, who had relied on Feynman's erroneous passage in an exam. To Ms. Cox, Feynman wrote in 1975,*「Your instructor was right not to give you any points, for your answer was wrong, as he demonstrated using Gauss's law. You should, in science, believe logic and arguments, carefully drawn, and not authorities. You also read the book correctly and understood it. I made a mistake, so the book is wrong. I probably was thinking of a grounded conducting sphere, or else of the fact that moving the charges around in diﬀerent places inside does not aﬀect things on the outside. I am not sure how I did it, but I goofed. And you goofed, too, for believing me.」

`*` For descriptions of the genesis of Feynman's lectures and of these volumes, see Feynman's Preface and the Forewords to each of the three volumes, and also Matt Sands' Memoir in Feynman's Tips on Physics, and the Special Preface to the Commemorative Edition of FLP, written in 1989 by David Goodstein and Gerry Neugebauer, which also appears in the 2005 Deﬁnitive Edition.

† In 1975, he started checking errata for Volume III but got distracted by other things and never ﬁnished the task, so no corrections were made.

改错的历史

《费恩曼物理学讲义》是费恩曼和他的合作者罗伯特·菜顿及马修桑兹非常仓促之中创作出来的，根据费恩曼的讲课的录音带和黑板照相（这些都编入这新千年版的增强电子版）加工扩充而成。由于要求费恩曼、菜顿和桑兹高速度工作，不可避免地有许多错误隐藏在第一版中。在以后几年中，费恩曼收集了加州理工学院的学生和同事以及世界各地的读者发现的、长长的、确定的错误列表。在 20 世纪 60 年代和 70 年代早期，费恩曼在他的紧张的生活中抽出时间来核实第 1 卷和第 2 卷中确认的大多数，不是全部错误，并在以后的印刷中加入了勘误表。但是费恩曼的责任感从来没有高到超过发现新事物的激情而促使他处理第 3 卷中的错误。在 1988 年他过早的逝世后，所有三卷的勘误表都存放到加州理工学院档案馆，它们躺在那里被遗忘了。

2002 年，拉尔夫·菜顿（Ralph Leighton)（已故罗伯特·莱顿的儿子，费恩曼的同胞）告诉我，拉尔夫的朋友迈克尔·戈特里勃（Michael Gottlieb）汇编了老的和长长的新的勘误表。莱顿建议加州理工学院编纂一个改正所有错误的《费恩曼物理学讲义》的新版本，并将他和戈特里勃当时正在编写的新的辅助材料 一一 《费恩曼物理学指导手册》一同出版。

费恩曼是我心目中的英雄，也是亲密的朋友。当我看到勘误表和提交的新的一卷的内容时，我很快就代表加州理工学院（这是费恩曼长时期的学术之家，他、莱顿和桑兹已将《费恩曼物理学讲义》所有的出版权利和责任都委托给她了）同意了。一年半以后，经过戈特里勃细微工作和迈克尔·哈特尔（Micheal Hartl)（一位优秀的加州理工学院博士后工作者，他审校了加上新的一卷的所有的错误）仔细的校阅，《费恩曼物理学讲义》的 2005 限定版诞生了，其中包括大约 200 处勘误。同时发行了费恩曼、戈特里勃和菜顿的《费恩曼物理学指导手册》。

我原来以为这一版是「定本」了。出乎我意料的是全世界读者热情响应。戈特里勃呼大家鉴别出更多错误，并通过创建的费恩曼讲义网站 www.feynmanlectures.info 提交给他。从那时起的五年内，又提交了 965 处新发现的错误，这些都是从戈特里勃、哈特尔和纳特·博德（Nate Bode)（一位优秀的加州理工学院研究生，他是继哈特尔之后的加州理工学院的错误检査员）的仔细校对中遗漏的。这些 965 处被检査出来的错误中 80 处在《定本》的第四次印刷（2006 年 8 月）中改正了，余下的 885 处在这一新千年版的第一次印刷中被改正（第 1 卷中 332 处，第 2 卷中 263 处，第 3 卷 200 处），这些错误的详情可参看 www.feynman.lectures.info。

显然，使《费恩曼物理学讲义》没有错误已成为全世界的共同事业。我代表加州理工学院感谢 2005 年以来作了贡献的 50 位读者以及更多的在以后的年代里会作出贡献的读者。所有贡献者的名字都公示在 www.feynmanlectures.. Info/flp-errata.html 上。

几乎所有的错误都可分为三种类型：1）文字中的印刷错误；2）公式和图表中的印刷和数学错误 一一 符号错误，错误的数字（例如，应该是 4 的写成 5），缺失下标、求和符号、括号和方程式中一些项；3）不正确的章节、表格和图的参见条目。这几种类型的错误虽然对成熟的物理学家来说并不特别严重，但对于初识费恩曼的学生，就可能造成困惑和混淆。

值得注意的是，在我主持下改正的 1165 处错误中只有不多几处我确实认为是真正物理上的错误。一个例子是第二卷，59 页上一句话，现在是：… 接地的封闭导体内部没有稳定的电荷分布不会在外部产生「电」场（在以前的版本中漏掉了接地一词）。

这一错误是好些读者都曾向费恩曼指出过的，其中包括威廉和玛丽学院（The College of William and Mary）学生比尤拉·伊丽莎白·柯克斯（Beulah Elizabeth Cox），她在一次考试中依据的是费恩曼的错误的段落。费恩曼在 1975 年给柯克斯女士的信中写道：「你的导师不给你分数是对的，因为正像他用高斯定律证明的那样，你的答案错了。在科学中你应当相信逻辑和论据、仔细推理而不是权威。你也正确阅读和理解了书本。我犯了一个错误，所以书错了。当时我或许正想着一个接地的导电球体，或别的；使电荷在（导体球）内部各处运动而不影响外部的事物。我不能确定当时是怎样做的。但我错了。你由于信任我也错了。」

费恩曼的讲课和这三本书的起源的说法请参阅这三本书每一本都有的《费恩曼自序》和《前言》，也可参看《费恩曼物理学指导手册》中马修·桑兹的回忆以及 1989 年戴维·古德斯坦（David Goodstein）和格里·诺格鲍尔（Gerry Neugebauer）撰写的《费恩曼物理学讲义纪念版》特刊前言，它也刊载在 2005 年限定版中。

1975 年，他开始审核第 3 卷中的错误，但被其他事情所分心，因而没有完成这项工作，所以没有作出勘误。

### 03. How this New Millennium Edition Came to Be

Between November 2005 and July 2006, 340 errata were submitted to The Feynman Lectures Website www.feynmanlectures.info. Remarkably, the bulk of these came from one person: Dr. Rudolf Pfeiﬀer, then a physics postdoctoral fellow at the University of Vienna, Austria. The publisher, Addison Wesley, ﬁxed 80 errata, but balked at ﬁxing more because of cost: the books were being printed by a photo-oﬀset process, working from photographic images of the pages from the 1960s. Correcting an error involved re-typesetting the entire page, and to ensure no new errors crept in, the page was re-typeset twice by two diﬀerent people, then compared and proofread by several other people — a very costly process indeed, when hundreds of errata are involved.

Gottlieb, Pfeiﬀer and Ralph Leighton were very unhappy about this, so they formulated a plan aimed at facilitating the repair of all errata, and also aimed at producing eBook and enhanced electronic versions of The Feynman Lectures on Physics. They proposed their plan to me, as Caltech's representative, in 2007. I was enthusiastic but cautious. After seeing further details, including a one-chapter demonstration of the Enhanced Electronic Version, I recommended that Caltech cooperate with Gottlieb, Pfeiﬀer and Leighton in the execution of their plan. The plan was approved by three successive chairs of Caltech's Division of Physics, Mathematics and Astronomy — Tom Tombrello, Andrew Lange, and Tom Soifer — and the complex legal and contractual details were worked out by Caltech's Intellectual Property Counsel, Adam Cochran. With the publication of this New Millennium Edition, the plan has been executed successfully, despite its complexity. Speciﬁcally: Pfeiﬀer and Gottlieb have converted into LATEX all three volumes of FLP (and also more than 1000 exercises from the Feynman course for incorporation into Feynman's Tips on Physics). The FLP ﬁgures were redrawn in modern electronic form in India, under guidance of the FLP German translator, Henning Heinze, for use in the German edition. Gottlieb and Pfeiﬀer traded non-exclusive use of their LATEX equations in the German edition (published by Oldenbourg) for non-exclusive use of Heinze's ﬁgures in this New Millennium English edition. Pfeiﬀer and Gottlieb have meticulously checked all the LATEX text and equations and all the redrawn ﬁgures, and made corrections as needed. Nate Bode and I, on behalf of Caltech, have done spot checks of text, equations, and ﬁgures; and remarkably, we have found no errors. Pfeiﬀer and Gottlieb are unbelievably meticulous and accurate. Gottlieb and Pfeiﬀer arranged for John Sullivan at the Huntington Library to digitize the photos of Feynman's 1962–64 blackboards, and for George Blood Audio to digitize the lecture tapes — with ﬁnancial support and encouragement from Caltech Professor Carver Mead, logistical support from Caltech Archivist Shelley Erwin, and legal support from Cochran.

The legal issues were serious: In the 1960s, Caltech licensed to Addison Wesley rights to publish the print edition, and in the 1990s, rights to distribute the audio of Feynman's lectures and a variant of an electronic edition. In the 2000s, through a sequence of acquisitions of those licenses, the print rights were transferred to the Pearson publishing group, while rights to the audio and the electronic version were transferred to the Perseus publishing group. Cochran, with the aid of Ike Williams, an attorney who specializes in publishing, succeeded in uniting all of these rights with Perseus (Basic Books), making possible this New Millennium Edition.

这一新年版是怎样产生的

2005 年 11 月到 2006 年 7 月之间，340 个错误被提交到费恩曼讲义网站  www.feynmanlectures.info。值得注意的是，其中大多数来自鲁道夫·普法伊弗（Rudolf Pfeiffer）博士个人：当时是奥地利维也纳大学的物理学博士后工作者。出版商艾迪生·卫斯利（Addison Wesley），改正了 80 处错误，但由于费用的缘故而没有改正更多的错误：由于书是用照相胶印法印刷的，用 1960 年代版本书页的照相图出版印刷。改正一个错误就要将整个页面重新排字并要保证不产生新的错误，书页要两个不同的人分别各排一页，然后由另外几个人比较和校读。 一一 如果有几百个错误要改正，这确是一项花费巨大的工作。

戈特里勃、普法伊弗和拉尔夫·菜顿对此非常不满意，于是他们制定了一个计划，目的是便于改正所有错误，另一目的是做成电子书的《费恩曼物理学讲义》的加强电子版。2007 年，他们将他们的计划向作为加州理工学院的代理人的我提出，我热心而又謹慎。当我知道了更多的细节，包括《加强电子版本》中一章的示范以后，我建议加州理工学院和戈特里勃、普法伊弗及莱顿合作来实现他们的计划。这个计划得到三位前后相继担任加州理工学院物理学、数学和天文学学部主任 —— 汤姆·汤勃列罗（Tom Tomlrello）、安鲁·兰格（An drew Lange）和汤姆·索伊弗（Tom Saifer）的支持；复杂的法律手续及合同细节由加州理工学院的知识产权法律顾问亚当·柯奇伦（Adam Cochran）完成。

《新千年版》的出版标示着该计划虽然很复杂但已成功地得到执行。尤其是普法伊弗和戈特里勃已将所有三卷《费恩曼物理学讲义》（以及来自费恩曼的课程并收入《费恩曼物理学指导书》的 1000 多道习题）转换成 LATEX。《费恩曼物理学讲义》的图是在书的德文译者享宁·海因策（Henning Heinze）的指导下，为用于德文版，在印度用现代的电子方法重画的。为了将海因策的插图的非独家使用于新干年英文版，戈特里勃和普法伊弗购买了德文版【奥尔登博（Oldenbourg）出版】的 LATEX 方程式的非独家的使用权，普法伊弗和戈特里勃不厌其烦地校对了所有心 LATEX 文本和方程式以及所有重画的插图，并必要时作了改正。纳特·博德和我代表加州理工学院对课文、方程式和图曾作过抽样调査，值得注意的是，我们没有发现错误。普法伊勃和戈特里勃是惊人的细心和精确。戈特里勃和普法伊弗为约翰·沙利文（John Sullivan）在亨丁顿实验室安排了将费恩曼在 1962-1964 年黑板照相数字化，以及乔治·布卢迪·奥迪欧（George Blood Audio）将讲课录音磁带数字化从加州理工学院教授卡弗·米德（Carver Mead）获得财政资助和鼓励，从加州理工学院档案保管员谢利·欧文（Shelly Erwin）处得到后勤支持，并从柯奇伦处得到法律支持。

法律问题是很严肃的。20 世纪 60 年代，加州理工学院特许艾迪生·卫斯利发表印刷版的权利，20 世纪 90 年代，给予分发费恩曼讲课录音和各种电子版的权利。在 21 世纪初，由于先后取得这些特许证，印刷物的权利转让给了培生（Pearson）出版集团，而录音和电子版转让给珀修斯（Perseus）出版集团。柯奇伦在一位专长于出版的律师艾克威廉姆斯（Ike Williams）的协助下，成功将所有这些权利和珀修斯结合在一起，使这一新千年版成为可能。

## Feynman's Preface

These are the lectures in physics that I gave last year and the year before to the freshman and sophomore classes at Caltech. The lectures are, of course, not verbatim — they have been edited, sometimes extensively and sometimes less so. The lectures form only part of the complete course. The whole group of 180 students gathered in a big lecture room twice a week to hear these lectures and then they broke up into small groups of 15 to 20 students in recitation sections under the guidance of a teaching assistant. In addition, there was a laboratory session once a week.

The special problem we tried to get at with these lectures was to maintain the interest of the very enthusiastic and rather smart students coming out of the high schools and into Caltech. They have heard a lot about how interesting and exciting physics is — the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, and other modern ideas. By the end of two years of our previous course, many would be very discouraged because there were really very few grand, new, modern ideas presented to them. They were made to study inclined planes, electrostatics, and so forth, and after two years it was quite stultifying. The problem was whether or not we could make a course which would save the more advanced and excited student by maintaining his enthusiasm.

The lectures here are not in any way meant to be a survey course, but are very serious. I thought to address them to the most intelligent in the class and to make sure, if possible, that even the most intelligent student was unable to completely encompass everything that was in the lectures — by putting in suggestions of applications of the ideas and concepts in various directions outside the main line of attack. For this reason, though, I tried very hard to make all the statements as accurate as possible, to point out in every case where the equations and ideas ﬁtted into the body of physics, and how — when they learned more — things would be modiﬁed. I also felt that for such students it is important to indicate what it is that they should — if they are suﬃciently clever — be able to understand by deduction from what has been said before, and what is being put in as something new. When new ideas came in, I would try either to deduce them if they were deducible, or to explain that it was a new idea which hadn't any basis in terms of things they had already learned and which was not supposed to be provable — but was just added in.

At the start of these lectures, I assumed that the students knew something when they came out of high school — such things as geometrical optics, simple chemistry ideas, and so on. I also didn't see that there was any reason to make the lectures in a deﬁnite order, in the sense that I would not be allowed to mention something until I was ready to discuss it in detail. There was a great deal of mention of things to come, without complete discussions. These more complete discussions would come later when the preparation became more advanced. Examples are the discussions of inductance, and of energy levels, which are at ﬁrst brought in in a very qualitative way and are later developed more completely. At the same time that I was aiming at the more active student, I also wanted to take care of the fellow for whom the extra ﬁreworks and side applications are merely disquieting and who cannot be expected to learn most of the material in the lecture at all. For such students I wanted there to be at least a central core or backbone of material which he could get. Even if he didn't understand everything in a lecture, I hoped he wouldn't get nervous. I didn't expect him to understand everything, but only the central and most direct features. It takes, of course, a certain intelligence on his part to see which are the central theorems and central ideas, and which are the more advanced side issues and applications which he may understand only in later years.

In giving these lectures there was one serious diﬃculty: in the way the course was given, there wasn't any feedback from the students to the lecturer to indicate how well the lectures were going over. This is indeed a very serious diﬃculty, and I don't know how good the lectures really are. The whole thing was essentially an experiment. And if I did it again I wouldn't do it the same way — I hope I don't have to do it again! I think, though, that things worked out — so far as the physics is concerned — quite satisfactorily in the ﬁrst year.

In the second year I was not so satisﬁed. In the ﬁrst part of the course, dealing with electricity and magnetism, I couldn't think of any really unique or diﬀerent way of doing it — of any way that would be particularly more exciting than the usual way of presenting it. So I don't think I did very much in the lectures on electricity and magnetism. At the end of the second year I had originally intended to go on, after the electricity and magnetism, by giving some more lectures on the properties of materials, but mainly to take up things like fundamental modes, solutions of the diﬀusion equation, vibrating systems, orthogonal functions, . . . developing the ﬁrst stages of what are usually called「the mathematical methods of physics.」In retrospect, I think that if I were doing it again I would go back to that original idea. But since it was not planned that I would be giving these lectures again, it was suggested that it might be a good idea to try to give an introduction to the quantum mechanics — what you will ﬁnd in Volume III.

It is perfectly clear that students who will major in physics can wait until their third year for quantum mechanics. On the other hand, the argument was made that many of the students in our course study physics as a background for their primary interest in other ﬁelds. And the usual way of dealing with quantum mechanics makes that subject almost unavailable for the great majority of students because they have to take so long to learn it. Yet, in its real applications —  especially in its more complex applications, such as in electrical engineering and chemistry — the full machinery of the diﬀerential equation approach is not actually used. So I tried to describe the principles of quantum mechanics in a way which wouldn't require that one ﬁrst know the mathematics of partial diﬀerential equations. Even for a physicist I think that is an interesting thing to try to do — to present quantum mechanics in this reverse fashion — for several reasons which may be apparent in the lectures themselves. However, I think that the experiment in the quantum mechanics part was not completely successful — in large part because I really did not have enough time at the end (I should, for instance, have had three or four more lectures in order to deal more completely with such matters as energy bands and the spatial dependence of amplitudes). Also, I had never presented the subject this way before, so the lack of feedback was particularly serious. I now believe the quantum mechanics should be given at a later time. Maybe I'll have a chance to do it again someday. Then I'll do it right. The reason there are no lectures on how to solve problems is because there were recitation sections. Although I did put in three lectures in the ﬁrst year on how to solve problems, they are not included here. Also there was a lecture on inertial guidance which certainly belongs after the lecture on rotating systems, but which was, unfortunately, omitted. The ﬁfth and sixth lectures are actually due to Matthew Sands, as I was out of town.

The question, of course, is how well this experiment has succeeded. My own point of view — which, however, does not seem to be shared by most of the people who worked with the students — is pessimistic. I don't think I did very well by the students. When I look at the way the majority of the students handled the problems on the examinations, I think that the system is a failure. Of course, my friends point out to me that there were one or two dozen students who — very surprisingly — understood almost everything in all of the lectures, and who were quite active in working with the material and worrying about the many points in an excited and interested way. These people have now, I believe, a ﬁrst-rate background in physics — and they are, after all, the ones I was trying to get at. But then,「The power of instruction is seldom of much eﬃcacy except in those happy dispositions where it is almost superﬂuous.」(Gibbon)

Still, I didn't want to leave any student completely behind, as perhaps I did. I think one way we could help the students more would be by putting more hard work into developing a set of problems which would elucidate some of the ideas in the lectures. Problems give a good opportunity to ﬁll out the material of the lectures and make more realistic, more complete, and more settled in the mind the ideas that have been exposed.

I think, however, that there isn't any solution to this problem of education other than to realize that the best teaching can be done only when there is a direct individual relationship between a student and a good teacher — a situation in which the student discusses the ideas, thinks about the things, and talks about the things. It's impossible to learn very much by simply sitting in a lecture, or even by simply doing problems that are assigned. But in our modern times we have so many students to teach that we have to try to ﬁnd some substitute for the ideal. Perhaps my lectures can make some contribution. Perhaps in some small place where there are individual teachers and students, they may get some inspiration or some ideas from the lectures. Perhaps they will have fun thinking them through — or going on to develop some of the ideas further.

这是我前年与去年在加利福尼亚理工学院对一二年级学生讲授物理学的讲义。当然，这本讲义并不是课堂讲授的逐字逐句记录，而是已经经过了编辑加工，有的地方多一些，有的地方少ー些。我们的课堂讲授只是整个课程的一部分。全班 180 个学生每周两次聚集在大教室里听课，然后分成 15 到 20 人的小组在助教辅导下进行复习巩固。此外，每周还有一次实验课。

在这些讲授中，我们想要抓住的特殊问题是，要使充满热情而又相当聪明的中学毕业生进入加利福尼亚理工学院后仍旧保持他们的兴趣。他们在进入学院前就听说过不少关于物理学是如何有趣以及如何引人入胜 一一 相对论、量子力学以及其他的新概念。但是，一旦他们学完两年我们以前的那种课程后，许多人就泄气了，因为教给他们意义重大、新颖的现代的物理概念实在太少。他们被安排去学习像斜面、静电学以及诸如此类的内容，两年过去没什么收获。问题在于，我们是否有可能设置一门课程能够顾全那些比较优秀的、兴致勃勃的学生，使其保持求知热情。

我们所讲授的课程丝毫也不意味着是一门概况性的课程，而是极其严肃的。我想这些课程是对班级中最聪明的学生而讲的，并且可以肯定，这可能是对的，甚至最聪明的学生也无法完全消化讲课中的所有内容 —— 其中加入了除主要讨论的内容之外的有关思想和概念多方面应用的建议。不过，为了这个缘故，我力图使所有的陈述尽可能准确，并在每种场合都指明有关的方程式和概念在物理学的主体中占有什么地位，以及 一一 随着他们学习深入应怎样作出修正。我还感到，重要的是要向这样的学生指出，他们应能理解 一一 如果他们够聪明的话 一一 哪些是从已学过的内容中推演出来的，哪些是作为新的概念而引进的。当出现新的概念时，假若这些概念是可推演的，我就尽量把它们推演出来，否则就直接说明这是个新的概念，它根本不能用已学过的东西来阐明，也不可能予以证明，而是直接引进的。

在讲授开始时，我假定学生们在中学已学过一些内容，如几何光学、简单的化学概念，等等。我也看不出有任何理由要按一定的次序来讲授。就是说没有详细讨论某些内容之前，不可以提到这些内容。在讲授中，有许多当时还没有充分讨论过的内容出现。这些内容比较完整的讨论要到以后学生的预备知识更齐全时再进行。电感和能级的概念就是例子，起先，只是以非常定性的方式引入这些概念，后来再进行较全面的讨论。

在针对那些较积极的学生的同时，我也要照顾到另一些学生，对他们来说，这些外加的五彩缤纷的内容和不重要的应用只会使其感到头痛，也根本不能要求他们掌握讲授中的大部分内容。对这些学生而言，我要求他们至少能学到中心内容或材料的脉络。即使他不理解一堂课中的所有内容，我希望他也不要紧张不安。我并不要求他理解所有的内容，只要求他理解核心的和最确切的面貌。当然，对他来说也应当具有一定的理解能力，来领会哪些是主要定理和主要概念，哪些则是更高深的枝节问题和应用，这些要过几年他才会理解。

在讲课过程中有一个严重困难：在课程的讲授过程中一点也没有学生给教师的反馈来指示讲授的效果究竟如何。这的确是一个很严重的困难，我不知道讲课的实际效果的好坏。整个事件实质上是一种实验。假如要再讲一次的话，我将不会按同样的方式去讲 一一 我希望我不会再来一次！然而，我想就物理内容来说，第一年的情形看来还是十分满意的。

但在第二年，我就不那么满意了。课程的第一部分涉及电学和磁学，我想不出什么真正独特的或不同的处理方法，也想不出什么比通常的讲授方式格外引人入胜的方法。因此在讲授电磁学时，我并不认为自己做了很多事情。在第二年末，我原来打算在电磁学后再多讲些物性方面的内容，主要讨论这样一些内容，如基本模式、扩散方程的解、振动系统、正交函数等等，并且阐述通常称为「数学物理方法」的初等部分内容。回顾起来，我想假如再讲一次的话，我会回到原来的想法上去，但由于没有要我再讲这些课程的打算，有人就建议介绍些量子力学 一一 就是你们将在第 3 卷中见到的 一一 或许是有益的。

显然，主修物理学的学生们可以等到第三年学量子力学。但是，另ー方面，有一种说法认为许多听我们课的学生是把学习物理作为他们对其他领域的主要兴趣的背景；而通常处理量子力学的方式对大多数学生来说这些内容几乎是无用的，因为他们必须花费相当长的时间来学习它。然而，在量子力学的实际应用中 —— 特别是较复杂的应用中，如电机工程和化学领域内 一一 微分方程处理方法的全部工具实际上是用不到的。所以，我试图这样来描述量子力学的原理，即不要求学生首先掌握有关偏微分方程的数学。我想，即使对一个物理学家来说，我想试着这样做 一一 按照这种颠倒的方式来介绍量子力学 ー一 是一件有趣的事。由于种种理由，这从讲课本身或许会明白。不过我认为，在量子力学方面的尝试不是很成功，这主要是因为在最后我实际上已没有足够的时间（例如，我应该再多讲三四次来比较完整地讨论能带、概率幅的空间的依赖关系等这类问题）。而且，我过去从未以这种方式讲授过这部分课程，因此缺乏来自学生的反馈就尤其严重了。我现在相信，还是应当迟一些讲授量子力学。或许有一天我会有机会再来讲授这部分内容，到那时我将会讲好它。

在这本讲义中没有列入有关解题的内容，这是因为另有辅导课。虽然在第一年中，我的确讲授过三次关于怎样解题的内容，但没有将它们收在这里。此外，还讲过一次惯性导航，应该在转动系统后面，遗憾的是在这里也略去了。第五讲和第六讲实际上是桑兹讲授的，那时我正外出。

当然，问题在于我们这个尝试的效果究竟如何。我个人的看法是悲观的，虽然与学生接触的大部分教师似乎并不都有这种看法。我并不认为自己在对待学生方面做得很出色。当我看到大多数学生在考试中采取的处理问题的方法时，我认为这种方式是失败了。当然，朋友们提醒我，也有一二十个学生 一一 非常出人意外地 —— 几乎理解讲的全部内容，并且非常积极地攻读有关材料，兴奋地、感兴趣地研许多问题。我相信，这些学生现在已具备了流的物理基础，他们毕竟是我想要培养的学生。但是，「教育之力量鲜见成效，除非施之于天资敏悟者，然若此又实为多余。「吉本（Gibbon) `*`」

但是，我并不想使任何一个学生完全落在后面，或许我曾经这样做的。我想，我们能够更好地帮助学生的一个办法是，多花一些精力去编纂一套能够阐明讲课中的某些概念的习题。习题能够充实课堂讲授，使讲过的概念更加实际，更加完整和更加易于牢记。

然而，我认为要解决这个教育问题就要认识到最佳的教学只有当学生和优秀的教师之间建立起个人的直接关系，在这种情况下，学生可以讨论概念、考虑问题、谈论问题，除此之外，别无他法。仅仅坐在课堂里听课或者只做指定的习题是不可能学到许多东西的。但是，现在我们有这么多学生要教育，因此我们必须尽量找出一种代替理想情况的办法。或许，我的讲义可以作出一些贡献；也许在某些小地方有个别教师和学生会从讲义中受到一些启示或获得某些观念，当他们彻底思考讲授内容，或者进一步发展其中的一些想法时，他们或许会得到乐趣。

## Foreword

This book is based upon a course of lectures in introductory physics given by Prof. R. P. Feynman at the California Institute of Technology during the academic year 1961–62; it covers the ﬁrst year of the two-year introductory course taken by all Caltech freshmen and sophomores, and was followed in 1962–63 by a similar series covering the second year. The lectures constitute a major part of a fundamental revision of the introductory course, carried out over a four-year period.

The need for a basic revision arose both from the rapid development of physics in recent decades and from the fact that entering freshmen have shown a steady increase in mathematical ability as a result of improvements in high school mathe- matics course content. We hoped to take advantage of this improved mathematical background, and also to introduce enough modern subject matter to make the course challenging, interesting, and more representative of present-day physics. In order to generate a variety of ideas on what material to include and how to present it, a substantial number of the physics faculty were encouraged to oﬀer their ideas in the form of topical outlines for a revised course. Several of these were presented and were thoroughly and critically discussed. It was agreed almost at once that a basic revision of the course could not be accomplished either by merely adopting a diﬀerent textbook, or even by writing one ab initio, but that the new course should be centered about a set of lectures, to be presented at the rate of two or three per week; the appropriate text material would then be produced as a secondary operation as the course developed, and suitable laboratory experiments would also be arranged to ﬁt the lecture material. Accordingly, a rough outline of the course was established, but this was recognized as being incomplete, tentative, and subject to considerable modiﬁcation by whoever was to bear the responsibility for actually preparing the lectures.

Concerning the mechanism by which the course would ﬁnally be brought to life, several plans were considered. These plans were mostly rather similar, involving a cooperative eﬀort by N staﬀ members who would share the total burden symmetrically and equally: each man would take responsibility for 1/N of the material, deliver the lectures, and write text material for his part. However, the unavailability of suﬃcient staﬀ, and the diﬃculty of maintaining a uniform point of view because of diﬀerences in personality and philosophy of individual participants, made such plans seem unworkable.

The realization that we actually possessed the means to create not just a new and diﬀerent physics course, but possibly a unique one, came as a happy inspiration to Professor Sands. He suggested that Professor R. P. Feynman pre- pare and deliver the lectures, and that these be tape-recorded. When transcribed and edited, they would then become the textbook for the new course. This is essentially the plan that was adopted.

It was expected that the necessary editing would be minor, mainly consisting of supplying ﬁgures, and checking punctuation and grammar; it was to be done by one or two graduate students on a part-time basis. Unfortunately, this expectation was short-lived. It was, in fact, a major editorial operation to transform the verbatim transcript into readable form, even without the reorganization or revision of the subject matter that was sometimes required. Furthermore, it was not a job for a technical editor or for a graduate student, but one that required the close attention of a professional physicist for from ten to twenty hours per lecture!

The diﬃculty of the editorial task, together with the need to place the material in the hands of the students as soon as possible, set a strict limit upon the amount of「polishing」of the material that could be accomplished, and thus we were forced to aim toward a preliminary but technically correct product that could be used immediately, rather than one that might be considered ﬁnal or ﬁnished. Because of an urgent need for more copies for our students, and a heartening interest on the part of instructors and students at several other institutions, we decided to publish the material in its preliminary form rather than wait for a further major revision which might never occur. We have no illusions as to the completeness, smoothness, or logical organization of the material; in fact, we plan several minor modiﬁcations in the course in the immediate future, and we hope that it will not become static in form or content.

In addition to the lectures, which constitute a centrally important part of the course, it was necessary also to provide suitable exercises to develop the students' experience and ability, and suitable experiments to provide ﬁrst-hand contact with the lecture material in the laboratory. Neither of these aspects is in as advanced a state as the lecture material, but considerable progress has been made. Some exercises were made up as the lectures progressed, and these were expanded and ampliﬁed for use in the following year. However, because we are not yet satisﬁed that the exercises provide suﬃcient variety and depth of application of the lecture material to make the student fully aware of the tremendous power being placed at his disposal, the exercises are published separately in a less permanent form in order to encourage frequent revision.

A number of new experiments for the new course have been devised by Professor H. V. Neher. Among these are several which utilize the extremely low friction exhibited by a gas bearing: a novel linear air trough, with which quantitative measurements of one-dimensional motion, impacts, and harmonic motion can be made, and an air-supported, air-driven Maxwell top, with which accelerated rotational motion and gyroscopic precession and nutation can be studied. The development of new laboratory experiments is expected to continue for a considerable period of time.

The revision program was under the direction of Professors R. B. Leighton, H. V. Neher, and M. Sands. Oﬃcially participating in the program were Professors R. P. Feynman, G. Neugebauer, R. M. Sutton, H. P. Stabler,* F. Strong, and R. Vogt, from the division of Physics, Mathematics and Astronomy, and Professors T. Caughey, M. Plesset, and C. H. Wilts from the division of Engineering Science. The valuable assistance of all those contributing to the revision program is gratefully acknowledged. We are particularly indebted to the Ford Foundation, without whose ﬁnancial assistance this program could not have been carried out.

`*` 1961–62, while on leave from Williams College, Williamstown, Mass.

本书是根据费曼教授在加利福尼亚理工学院 1961-1962 学年所讲物理学导论课编写的，它包括全校一二年级学生念的两年导论课的第一年的内容，在 1962-1963 学年还继续讲授了这门课程的第二年的内容。这些讲授构成四年来对导论课所作的根本性修改的主要部分。

课程要进行彻底的修改，不但是由于近数十年来物理学迅速发展的需要，而且还有鉴于高中数学课内容改进后，入校新生的数学能力有了稳步的提高。我们希望利用有利的条件，并且希望能在课程中介绍足够的现代题材，从而使这门课程能引起学生的注意和兴趣，并能体现出现代物理的状况。

在应当包括哪些内容以及怎样介绍这些内容方面，为了能形成各种想法，我们鼓励物理系的许多教师以提纲的形式对课程的修改提出意见。人们对其中的几种想法进行了详细的讨论和评述。大家几乎立即同意，认为仅仅换一本教科书或者重新写一本教科书，是不可能完成对这门课程的彻底修改的。新的课程应当以每周讲二三次的一系列讲授为中心，而随着课程的进展，相应的教材内容将作为其从属的工作而产生出来，在讲课的同时，也要安排适当的实验来配合讲授内容。据此提出了课程的初步轮廓。但大家也认识到，这是不完全的和试验性的，有待于实际承担讲授工作的人作出相当大的修改。

关于最后究竟以什么方式来实施这门课程，大家考虑过几种方案。这些方案大多类似，由 N 个人进行合作，均匀地分担责任，即每个人负责 1/N 的材料，进行讲授，并使他这部分成文。然而，由于没有足够的教师，同时因为参加者的个性与哲学见解不同，很难保持一致的观点。因此这种方案看来难以实现。

桑兹教授令人鼓舞的想法是他领悟到，我们实际上所拥有的能力不只是可以建立一门新的、不同的物理课程，而且有可能创立一门完全独特的课程。他建议由费恩曼教授来准备和进行讲授，并用磁带录音。再将这些录音抄写出来并加以编辑，就成为新课程的教科书了。我们所采用的基本上就是这样的方案。

起先我们估计必要的编辑工作不会很多，大体上只是一些补充图画、核对标点、语法之类的事，完全可以由一两个研究生花部分时间去完成。遗憾的是我们很快就发现这种估计是不正确的。事实上，即使对题材不进行重新组织或修改（有时这是必要的），只是把逐字逐句的记录改写成可供阅读的形式，就需要相当多的编辑工作。而且，这不是一个技术编辑或一个研究生就能办得了的事，而是需要一位专业物理工作者对每次讲授的内容专心一致地花上 10-20 小时才行。

编辑任务的艰巨，再加上要尽快把材料发给学生，这就大大地限制了对材料所能作出的推敲润色工作。因此，我们只能指望完成一本初步的、但专业上保持正确的、立即可以使用的讲义，而不是一本可视为最终的或完备的讲义。由于本校学生急需的份数较多，同时还由于一些外校师生的鼓励和关心，我们决定不再等待进一步的大量修改 一一 这样的工作也许不会再做 一一 就将这些材料以这种初步的形式出版。我们对内容的完整，文体的流畅或组织的逻辑性都不抱幻想；事实上，我们打算在最近的将来对课程作一些小的修改，并且希望它无论在形式上还是在内容上，都不要停滞不前。

除去构成课程核心部分的讲授外，还有必要向学生提供适当的练习来启发他们的经验和才智，以及提供适当的实验使他们在实验室中能与讲课内容有第一手的接触。这两方面都还没有像讲课内容那样成熟，但也都取得了相当大的进展。在讲授过程中已选编了一些习题，并已进行增补扩充以供下一年使用。然而，我们还不能认为，在应用讲课内容方面，这些习题已具有足够的深度和广度，从而可使学生充分发挥其才智。所以，我们将这本习题集单独出版，以便鼓励经常的修订。

内尔（H. V. Neher）教授为新课程设计了许多新实验。其中有几个实验利用了空气轴承所显示的极低摩擦，例如新的直线气槽，用它可以对一维运动、碰撞和简谐振动作定量测量；利用空气支承、空气驱动的麦克斯韦陀螺可以研究加速转动，回转仪的进动和章动。预计发展新的供实验室用的实验这件事将会持续相当一段时间。

本书的修订计划是在菜顿（R. B. Leighton）、内尔和桑兹（M. Sands）教授指导下进行的。官方参与此计划的有来自物理、数学和天文部门的费恩曼、诺伊格鲍尔（G. Neugebauer）、萨顿（R. M. Sutton）、斯特布（H. P. Stabler）、斯特朗（F. Strong）和沃格特（R. Vogt）教授，以及来自工程科学部门的考伊（T. Caughey）、普菜西特（M. Plesset）和威尔茨（C. H. Wilts）教授。深深感谢所有为本书修订计划作出贡献的极有价值的帮助。我们还要特别感谢福特基金会（Ford Foundation）的资助，没有他们的经济资助，本计划是不可能顺利完成的。
