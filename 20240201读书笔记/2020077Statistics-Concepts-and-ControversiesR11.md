PART I Producing Data

You and your friends are not typical. What you listen to on the radio, for example, is probably not what we listen to. Of course, we and our friends are also not typical. To get a true picture of the country as a whole (or even of college students), we must recognize that the picture may not resemble us or what we see around us. We need data. Data from Nielsen (a consumer research firm) for September 11, 2018, show that the most popular radio formats during the summer of 2018 were news/talk (9.6% of listeners), adult contemporary hit radio (7.7% of listeners), and country (7.4% of listeners). If you like hot adult contemporary (5.5% of listeners) and we like classic rock (5.0% of listeners), we may have no clue about the tastes of radio audiences as a whole. If we are in the broadcasting business, or even if we are interested in pop culture, we must put our own tastes aside and look at the data.

You can find data in the library or on the Internet (that’s where we found the radio format data). But how can we know whether data can be trusted? Good data are as much a human product as wool sweaters and tablet PCs. Sloppily produced data will frustrate you as much as a sloppily made sweater. You examine a sweater before you buy, and you don't buy it if it is not well made. Neither should you use data that are not well made. The first part of this book shows how to tell if data are well made.

你和你的朋友不是典型人物。比如，你喜欢听的广播节目可能就和我喜欢的不一样。当然，我和我的朋友也不是典型人物。如果想要知道整个国家（或只是大学生）的状况，我们必须认清一个事实，那就是，整体状况也许和我们自己或我们周围的状况并不相似。所以，我们需要数据。从 Arbitron（一家媒体研究机构）得到的资料显示，美国最受欢迎的广播节目是成人当代音乐（2009 年秋天，每周的听众总人数达到 7200 万人）和乡村音乐（每周的听众总人数为 6400 万人）。如果你喜欢当代流行打击乐（每周的听众总人数为 5900 万人），而我喜欢各种新闻节目（每周的听众总人数为 1500 万人），那么我们可能对整个唱片消费群体的音乐品位一无所知。如果我们身处唱片业，或只对通俗文化感兴趣，就必须把自己的喜好放在一边，好好地检视数据。

你可以到图书馆或者网上找数据，但我们怎么知道这些数据可不可靠呢？好的数据可以被看作像毛衣或数码影音光碟机（DVD 机）之类的产品，而草率生产的数据就像草率生产的毛衣或 DVD 机一样令人沮丧。你买毛衣前一般都会检查一下，如果做工很差，你就不会买。数据也一样，如果质量很糟，你就不该用。本书的第一部分将会告诉你怎样分辨数据的好坏。

## 0101. Where Do Data Come From?

In this chapter you will: 1) Learn the different types of studies used to collect data. 2) Understand the purpose of these different types of studies used to collect data. 3) Examine the types of data a study might collect.

### Summary and Exercises

#### Chapter 1: Statistics in Summary

1 Any statistical study records data about some individuals (people, animals, or things) by giving the value of one or more variables for each individual.

2 Some variables, such as age and income, take numerical values. Others, such as occupation and sex, do not. Be sure the variables in a study really do tell you what you want to know.

3 The most important fact about any statistical study is how the data were produced. Observational studies try to gather information without disturbing the scene they are observing.

4 Sample surveys are an important kind of observational study. A sample survey chooses a sample from a specific population and uses the sample to get information about the entire population.

5 A census attempts to measure every individual in a population.

6 Experiments actually do something to individuals in order to see how they respond. The goal of an experiment is usually to learn whether some treatment actually causes a certain response.

This chapter summary will help you evaluate the Case Study.

1、任何一个统计研究都会记录关于一些个体（人、动物或物品）的数据，也就是一个或多个变量的值。

2、有些变量，比如年龄和收入，属于定量数据数值，而有些变量，比如职业或性别，则属于定性数据。要确保研究变量可以给你想要的信息。

3、对于任何一项统计研究，你最需要知道的是数据是如何产生的。观察研究是指，在只观察而不造成干扰的情况下搜集信息。

4、抽样调查是观察研究当中很重要的一种方式。抽样调查是从某个特定的总体中抽取样本，然后从样本中获得有关总体的信息。

5、普查试图对总体中的每个个体进行测量。

6、实验会对个体做某种处理，然后观察个体的反应。实验的目的通常是，了解某种处理是否会引起某种反应。

#### Link It

In reasoning from data to a conclusion, we start with the data. Where the data come from is the first step in the argument. The nature and validity of the conclusion are affected by this first step. Two sources of data are observational studies and experiments. Observational studies are best suited for a conclusion that involves describing some group or situation without disturbing the scene we observe. Sample surveys are a type of observational study in which we draw conclusions about a population by observing only a part of the population (the sample). Experiments are best suited for a conclusion that involves determining if a treatment causes a change in a response.

2『数据的两个来源：观察研究和试验，做一张主题卡片，需要后续不断补充信息。（2021-02-11）』——已完成

In the next several chapters, we discuss these sources of data in more detail. We will see what makes for a good observational study and for a good experiment. And we will see how a bad observational study or experiment undermines the validity of the conclusions we wish to make.

在依靠数据信息推导出结论的过程中，我们面临的第一个问题就是数据来自何处。统计研究结论的本质和有效性都取决于这一点。数据来自两个渠道：观察研究和实验。观察研究适合在无干扰的情况下描述某个群体或状况并得出结论。抽样调查是一种观察研究，我们通过观察总体的一部分（样本），得出有关总体的结论。实验适用于判断一种处理是否会产生不同的反应。在后面几章，我们将更深入地讨论数据的来源。我们将会看到怎样进行良好的观察研究和实验，我们还会看到糟糕的观察研究或实验是如何破坏我们想要获得的结论的有效性的。

#### Check the Basics

For Exercise 1.1, see page 10; for Exercise 1.2, see page 13.

1.3 Individuals and variables. A national survey by the Pew Research Center and USA Today, conducted August 16–Septermber 12, 2016, was based on web-based and mail responses of a national sample of 4538 adults, 18 years of age or older, living in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. Those interviewed were asked to rate the job performance of police forces across the country for holding officers accountable when misconduct occurs. Possible ratings were「Excellent,」「Good,」「Only fair,」and「Poor.」Seventy percent of white respondents gave a rating of「Excellent」or「Good,」while only 31% of black respondents gave a rating of「Excellent」or「Good.」For this study,

a) the individuals are the sample of 4538 adults interviewed. 

b) the variable is the rating a respondent selected. 

c) both (a) and (b). 

d) neither (a) nor (b).

1.4 Population and sample. For the survey described in the previous exercise, 

a) the population is the 4538 adults interviewed and the sample are those who gave a rating of excellent or good. 

b) the population is all adults, 18 years of age or older, living in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia, and the sample is those who gave a rating of poor. 

c) the population is all adults, 18 years of age or older, living in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia, and the sample is the black and white respondents. 

d) the population is all adults, 18 years of age or older, living in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia, and the sample is the 4538 adults who provided responses.

1.5 Observational studies and experiments. Researchers at UNLV studied whether the attractiveness of an instructor affected the performance of students. The researchers randomly assigned 131 UNLV students to one of several instructors. Students listened to a recording of an introductory physics lecture by their instructor, and each instructor delivered the same lecture. During the lecture, the students were shown different sets of photographs that they were told were images of the instructor. Some of the photographed people were good-looking, others less so. Students were quizzed after the lecture, and those with instructors deemed attractive performed better than those with unattractive instructors. Which of the following is true?

a) This is an observational study, and participants were volunteers.

b) This is an observational study, and participants were selected at random.

c) This is an experiment, but participants themselves decided which instructor to listen to.

d) This is an experiment, and participants were randomly assigned to treatments (instructors).

1.6 Response variable. For the study described in the previous exercise, the response variable is which of the following?

a) Scores on a quiz.

b) Whether a subject was assigned to a group with an attractive or unattractive instructor.

c) The recorded lecture.

d) The 131 students.

1.7 A census? A study is considered to be a census if

a) the population of interest is very large.

b) the study attempts to measure every individual in a population.

c) all units in the study receive some treatment.

d) it attempts to answer questions about the opinions of all citizens of a particular country.

1.9 Athletes’ salaries. Here is a small part of a data set that describes Major League Baseball players as of opening day of the 2018 season:

What individuals does this data set describe?

In addition to the player’s name, how many variables does the data set contain? Which of these variables take numerical values?

What do you think are the units in which each of the numerical variables is expressed? For example, what does it mean to give Mike Trout’s annual salary as 34,083? (Hint: The average annual salary of a Major League Baseball player on opening day, 2018, was, with roundoff, `$`4,520,000.)

1.10 Who recycles? In Example 1, weight is not a good measure of the participation of households in different neighborhoods in a city recycling program. What variables would you measure in its place?

1.11 Sampling moms. Pregnant and breast-feeding women should eat at least 12 ounces of fish and seafood per week to ensure their babies’ optimal brain development, according to a coalition of top scientists from private groups and federal agencies. A nutritionist wants to know whether pregnant women are eating at least 12 ounces of fish per week. To do so, she obtains a list of the 340 members of a local chain of prenatal fitness clubs and mails a questionnaire to 60 of these women selected at random. Only 21 questionnaires are returned. What is the population in this study? What is the sample from which information is actually obtained? What percentage of the women whom the nutritionist tried to contact responded?

1.12 The death penalty. A press release by the Gallup News Service says that, based on a poll conducted on October 5–11, 2017, it found that 55% of Americans respond Yes when asked this question:「Are you in favor of the death penalty for a person convicted of murder?」Toward the end of the article, you read:「Results for this Gallup poll are based on telephone interviews conducted October 5–11, 2017, with a random sample of 1,028 adults, aged 18 and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia.」What variable did this poll measure? What population do you think Gallup wants information about? What was the sample?

1.13 The political gender gap. There may be a「gender gap」in political party preference in the United States, with women more likely than men to prefer Democratic candidates. A political scientist interviews a large sample of registered voters, both men and women. She asks each voter whether he or she voted for the Democratic or the Republican candidate in the last presidential election. Is this study an experiment? Why or why not? What variables does the study measure?

1.14 What is the population? For each of the following sampling situations, identify the population as exactly as possible. That is, say what kind of individuals the population consists of and say exactly which individuals fall in the population. If the information given is not sufficient, complete the description of the population by making reasonable assumptions about any missing information.

An opinion poll contacts 972 American adults and asks them,「Would you rather have a job working for the government or working for business?」

Video adapter cables have pins that plug into slots in a computer monitor. The adapter will not work if pins are bent or broken. A computer store buys video adapter cables in large lots from a supplier. The store chooses five cables from each lot and inspects the pins. If any of the cables have bent or broken pins, the entire lot is sent back.

The American Community Survey contacts 3.5 million households, including some in every county in the United States. This Census Bureau survey asks each household questions about their housing, economic, and social status.

1.15 What is the population? For each of the following sampling situations, identify the population as exactly as possible. That is, say what kind of individuals the population consists of and say exactly which individuals fall in the population. If the information given is not sufficient, complete the description of the population in a reasonable way.

A sociologist is interested in determining what proportion of teens believe the drinking age should be lowered to 18 in all the states. She selects a sample of five high schools in a large city and interviews all 12th graders in each of the schools.

A medical researcher is interested in the rate of dementia among former NFL football players. From a list of living, former players he selects a sample of 20 and interviews them to determine if signs of dementia are present.

The host of a local radio talk show wonders if people who are actively religious are more likely to trust their neighbors than those who are not. The station receives calls from 51 listeners who voice their opinions.

1.16 Teens sleep needs. A Washington Post article reported on a study about the sleep needs of teenagers. In the study, researchers measured the presence of the sleep-promoting hormone melatonin in teenagers’ saliva at different times of the day. They learned that the melatonin levels rise later at night than they do in children and adults and remain at a higher level later in the morning. The teenagers who took part in the study were volunteers. Higher levels of melatonin indicate sleepiness. The researchers recommended that high schools start later in the day to accommodate the sleep needs of teens. Is this study an experiment, a sample survey, or an observational study that is not a sample survey? Explain your answer.

1.17 Power lines and leukemia. The study of power lines and leukemia in Example 3 compared two groups of individuals and measured many variables that might influence differences between the groups. Explain carefully why this study is not an experiment.

1.18 Treating prostate disease. A large study used records from Canada’s national health care system to compare the effectiveness of two ways to treat prostate disease. The two treatments are traditional surgery and a new method that does not require surgery. The records described many patients whose doctors had chosen one or the other method. The study found that patients treated by the new method were more likely to die within eight years.

Explain why this is an observational study, not an experiment.

Briefly describe the nature of an experiment to compare the two ways to treat prostate disease.

1.19 Walnuts and cholesterol. Does eating walnuts increase the level of good cholesterol (HDL) and reduce the level of bad cholesterol (LDL)? Here are two ways to study this question.

Researchers in Australia recruited 58 adults with diabetes for a research study. These subjects were randomly assigned to two treatment groups: a low-modified-fat diet group and a low-modified-fat diet group that included a handful of walnuts each day. After six months, researchers compared changes in HDL and LDL levels for the two groups.

Another team of researchers recruited 58 adults with diabetes who regularly eat walnuts as part of their diet. The researchers match each with a similar adult with diabetes who does not regularly eat walnuts. The researchers measured the HDL and LDL for each adult and compared the results for both groups. Explain why the first is an experiment and the second is an observational study.

Why does the experiment give more useful information about whether walnuts increase HDL and reduce LDL?

1.20 Alcohol and cancer in women. A Washington Post article reported on a study about alcohol consumption and cancer in women. Since 1996, a team of British researchers has been gathering detailed information from 1.28 million women aged 50 to 64. The researchers recorded how much alcohol the women reported consuming when they volunteered for the study and again three years later. The researchers then examined whether there was any link with the 68,775 cancers the women developed over an average of the next seven years. They found that even among women who consumed as little as 10 grams of alcohol a day on average (the equivalent of about one drink), the risk for cancer of the breast, liver, and rectum was elevated.

Is this an experiment? Explain your answer.

We would prefer a sample survey to using women who volunteer for a study. What population does it appear that the researchers were interested in? What variables did they measure?

1.21 Alcohol and longevity. A Chicago Tribune article reported on a study about alcohol consumption and how long you live. The research tracked 1700 nonagenarians (adults in their 90s) enrolled in the study that began in 2003 to explore impacts of daily habits on longevity. The researchers discovered that subjects who drank about two glasses of beer or wine a day were 18% less likely to experience a premature death. Meanwhile, participants who exercised 15 to 45 minutes a day cut the same risk by 11%.

Is this an experiment? Explain your answer.

We would prefer a sample survey to using nonagenarians who volunteer for a study. What population does it appear that the researchers were interested in? What variables did they measure?

1.22 Bullying. Researchers tracked 2668 people from early childhood through adulthood and found that 13-year-olds who are frequent targets of bullies were three times more likely than their nonvictimized peers to be depressed later as adults. What is the population in this study? What is the sample? What variables do the researchers measure?

1.23 Choose your study type. What is the best way to answer each of the questions below: an experiment, a sample survey, or an observational study that is not a sample survey? Explain your choices.

a) Is your school’s football team called for fewer penalties in home games than in away games?

b) Are college students satisfied with the cost of textbooks that they are required to purchase?

c) Do college students who have access to video recordings of course lectures perform better in the course than those who don’t?

1.24 Choose your study purpose. Give an example of a question about pet owners, their behavior, or their opinions that would best be answered by: a) a sample survey. b) an observational study that is not a sample survey. c) an experiment.

1.4 美国棒球运动员的年薪。以下是美国职业棒球大联盟在 2011 赛季的第一天公布的部分球员资料：a）这个数据集描述的个体是什么？b）除了球员姓名外，这个数据集还包括哪几个变量？哪些变量的值是数字？

1.5 谁在做资源回收？在例 1 当中我们提到在同一个城市的两个不同社区间比较资源回收的成效时，重量不是理想的变量。那么，你建议用什么变量来替代重量？

1.6 在孕妇中做抽样调查。怀孕和哺乳期女性每周至少应该吃 12 盎司鱼类或海鲜，才能使她们的婴儿的大脑得到最好的发育。这是来自一个私营和联邦机构的顶级科学家小组的建议。一位营养学家想知道孕期女性是否每周都会吃至少 12 盎司鱼类。为此，她找到了一份当地孕妇健身俱乐部的 340 名会员的名单，从中随机选择了 60 名并给她们寄出了调查问卷，最终她只收回了 21 份问卷。该项研究的总体是什么？用于获取信息的样本是什么？在该营养师联络的女性中，寄回问卷的人占比多少？

1.7 死刑。盖洛普新闻服务机构发布的一条消息说，根据 2011 年 10 月 6 日～2011 年 10 月 9 日所做的民意调查，他们发现当被问到「你赞成对谋杀犯处以死刑吗」的问题时，61% 的美国人回答「是」。在该消息的结尾，你会读到「这个结果是基于随机电话访谈全国 1005 名 18 岁及以上成年人得到的」。这个抽样调查测量的变量是什么？你认为盖洛普的这项民意调查的总体是什么？样本是什么？

1.8 政治倾向的性别差异。在美国，政治倾向似乎存在性别差异，女性比男性更倾向于支持民主党。一位政治学者访问了许多选民，男性和女性都有。她问他们，上一次国会选举时把票投给了民主党还是共和党。这项研究是不是实验？你做出判断的理由是什么？该项研究测量了哪些变量？

1.9 总体是什么？针对下面几个抽样调查，将总体尽可能明确地指出来。也就是说，总体是由哪些个体组成的，哪些个体属于总体？如果题目提供的信息不足，你可以做出合理的假设。a）一项民意调查联络了 972 位成年人，问他们：「你更愿意为政府工作还是在公司工作？」b）视频接口线的一端有能插入电脑显示器插口的针型槽。如果里面的插针弯曲或损坏了，这条接口线就不能用了。一家电脑商店从供应商处批量采购视频接口线，从每批中抽出 5 条线检查插针情况。如果发现有插针弯曲或损坏的情况，则将整批接口线退回给供应商。c）美国社区调查计划联络 300 万个美国住户，全美每一个县中都有一些住户会被调查。该调查会询问每个住户关于居住状况、经济情况及社会地位等问题。

1.10 总体是什么？针对下面几个抽样调查，将总体尽可能明确地指出来。也就是说，总体是由哪些个体组成的，哪些个体属于总体？如果题目提供的信息不足，你可以做出合理的假设。a）一位社会学者想知道，有多大比例的青少年认为美国各州应把法定最低饮酒年龄降至 18 岁。她选择了一个样本，是一个大城市的 5 所高中，并访谈了每所学校所有的 12 年级学生。b）一名医学研究者想知道前美国国家橄榄球联盟（NFL）运动员中患阿尔茨海默病的比例。他从仍在世的人员名单中随机挑选了 20 名，并通过访谈来判断他们是否患有阿尔茨海默病的迹象。c）当地电台脱口秀主持人想知道有宗教信仰的人是否比没有宗教信仰的人更信任他们的邻居。电台收到了 51 个听众的电话反馈。

1.11 青少年的睡眠需求。《华盛顿邮报》一篇文章报道了一个关于青少年睡眠需求的研究。实验人员测量了一天当中各个时间段青少年唾液中产生的促进睡眠的褪黑素的含量。他们发现，青少年的褪黑素水平在夜间要比成年人和儿童的褪黑素水平高，在早上仍保持在较高水平上。参加该项研究的青少年都是自愿的。褪黑素水平较高表明需要睡眠，因此实验人员建议高中生的上课时间应该推迟一些，以满足学生的睡眠需求。这项研究是一个实验、抽样调查还是观察研究？请给出答案并说明你的理由。

1.12 高压电缆和白血病患儿。在例 3 对于高压电缆和白血病患儿关系的研究中，实验人员比较了两组个体，并且测量了许多可能关乎两组之间差异的变量。请详细说明为何这项研究不是实验。

1.13 治疗前列腺疾病。一项大型研究使用了加拿大全民医疗系统的记录，来比较两种前列腺疾病治疗方法的有效性。其中一种是传统的手术治疗，另一种是不需要做手术的新疗法。记录中有许多病人的资料，这些病人，有的选择了手术治疗，有些选择了新疗法。研究显示，选择新疗法的病人在 8 年内的死亡率较高。请说明为何这是观察研究而非实验。

1.14 燕麦和胆固醇。吃燕麦餐可以降低坏胆固醇（LDL）的水平？以下是研究这个问题的两种方法：

第一种方法是：一位研究者找到 500 位 40 岁以上的成年人，他们都定期食用燕麦或燕麦类食品。他将每个人都和一位不定期食用燕麦或燕麦类食品的同龄成年人进行比较，测量他们的坏胆固醇水平。

第二种方法是：另一位研究者找了 1000 位 40 岁以上的成年人，他们都没有定期食用燕麦或燕麦类食品，也都愿意参与这项研究。她随机安排其中 500 人每天早餐食用燕麦，而其他人继续按平时的习惯吃早餐。6 个月后，她比较了两组人的坏胆固醇水平。a）请说明为什么第一种研究方法是观察研究，而第二种研究方法是实验。b）为什么在燕麦是否可以降低坏胆固醇水平的问题上，实验可以提供更多的有效信息？

1.15 酒精和女性癌症患者。《华盛顿邮报》有一篇关于女性饮酒与癌症的研究报道。从 1996 年起，一群英国的实验人员开始收集 128 万名 50~64 岁女性的详细信息。实验人员记录了三年中这些自愿参加该研究的女性报告的饮酒量，并探究了在平均 7 年后出现的 68775 个女性癌症患者与她们饮酒之间是否有关联。他们发现，即使这些女性每天平均只摄入 10 克酒精（大约相当于一杯酒），她们患乳腺癌、肝癌和直肠癌的风险也会增加。a）这是不是实验？请说明理由。b）我们更喜欢在志愿参加调查研究的人中做抽样调查。那么，实验人员感兴趣的总体是什么？他们测量了哪些变量？

1.16 课本的成本。一名学生想知道一本教材的成本是否取决于其页数。于是，该学生走进校园书店，从书架上随机选择了一本教材，并记录下它的页数和价格。这项研究的总体是什么？样本是什么？该学生测量的变量是什么？

1.20 网上练习。你可以在美国国家环境健康科学研究所（NIEHS）的网站（网址为：www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics.agents/emf）上找到有关暴露在高压电缆下对健康的影响报告。尽管少量对于成年人暴露在高压电缆下的研究，表明成年人患癌症与住所的电磁场没有必然联系，但该网站上提到的 NIEHS 科学家对此问题的结论是什么？为什么？

### Case Study: An Online Poll

You can read the newspaper and watch TV news for months without seeing an algebraic formula. No wonder algebra seems unconnected to life. You can’t go a day, however, without meeting data and statistical studies. You hear that last month’s unemployment rate was 3.9%. A news article says that 87% of AAAS (the American Association for the Advancement of Science) scientists agree that climate change is mostly due to human activity, while only 50% of all U.S. residents 18 years of age and over agree. A longer article says that low-income children who received high-quality day care did better on academic tests given years later and were more likely to go to college and hold good jobs than other similar children.

Where do these data come from? Why can we trust them? Or maybe we can’t trust them. Good data are the fruit of intelligent human effort. Bad data result from laziness or lack of understanding, or even the desire to mislead others.「Where do the data come from?」is the first question you should ask when someone throws a number at you.

In 2012, Colorado voters legalized marijuana. Subsequently, voters in several other states have considered legalizing marijuana. One of these is Michigan. In February 2014, the Michigan online news site MLive ran the story「Take our online poll: Should Michigan legalize marijuana?」Of 9684 respondents, 7906 (81.64%) said Yes, 1190 (12.29%) said No, and 588 (6.07%) said decriminalize but not legalize. These results would seem to indicate overwhelming support for legalizing marijuana in Michigan.

What can we say about data from this poll? By the end of this chapter you will have learned some basic questions to ask about data from the MLive online poll. The answers to these questions will help us assess whether the data from the poll are good or bad, as we will explore further in Chapter 2.

你可能读了几个月的报纸，或者看了几个月的电视新闻，却没有见过一个代数公式。难怪你会认为代数看上去和日常生活完全无关。但是，你不可能一整天都接触不到统计数据和结果。比如，一则新闻提到在 18-24 岁年龄段的人中，有 70% 的人认为从互联网上下载音乐与购买二手音乐光碟或从朋友那里借来转录的做法没有区别。而对于 65 岁或以上的人来说，持相同观点的人只有 36%。一篇更长的文章写道，得到高质量日间看护的低收入家庭的孩子，几年后在学业方面的表现更佳，与其他低收入家庭的孩子相比，未来更有可能考上大学、找到好工作。

这些数据是从哪里来的呢？为什么我们可以相信这些数据，或者不应该相信这些数据？好的数据是人类智慧劳动的成果，坏的数据则源于懒惰或者不求甚解的行为，只能误导他人。当有人向你抛来一个数字时，你应该问的第一个问题就是：它来自何处？

2008 年美国总统大选期间，有一个全国性的项目叫作「大家去投票」，人们从罐中选择一粒软糖，代表他们支持的总统候选人。在佛罗里达州彭布罗克派恩斯的「咖啡苑」（Coffee Scene），顾客可以在每次买东西时挑选一粒蓝色或者红色的软糖。蓝莓软糖表示投票给民主党总统候选人巴拉克·奥巴马，红色草莓软糖表示投票给共和党总统候选人约翰·麦凯恩。

全美有 34 个州的超过 100 家餐馆参与了这项活动，每周一清点投票结果。截至 2008 年 10 月 13 日，投票总数超过 211000 张，麦凯恩在这场全国性的软糖投票中获得了 53.5% 的支持率。2004 年美国总统大选期间的软糖投票结果，曾准确预测出小布什将赢得总统大选。约翰·麦凯恩却没有那么幸运，投票结果错误地预测麦凯恩将在 2008 年的美国总统大选中胜出。

对于这个投票结果，我们该如何解读呢？在本章的最后，你将了解到，针对这个软糖投票活动产生的数据，如何提出一些基础性问题。对这些提问的回答，将帮助我们评估这个投票数据的优劣，我们将在第 2 章深入探讨这个问题。

### 1.1 Talking about Data: Individuals and Variables

Statistics is the science of data. We could almost say「the art of data」because good judgment and even good taste, along with good math, make good statistics. A big part of good judgment lies in deciding what you must measure in order to produce data that will shed light on your concerns. We begin with some vocabulary to describe the raw materials that go into data. For example, here are the first lines of a professor’s data set at the end of a statistics course:

Key Terms —— Individuals or units are the objects described by a set of data. Individuals may be people, but they may also be animals or things. A variable is any characteristic of an individual. A variable can take different values for different individuals. A categorical variable simply places an individual into one of several groups or categories. A numerical variable takes numerical values for which arithmetic operations such as adding and averaging make sense. A numerical variable is sometimes referred to as a quantitative variable.

The individuals are students enrolled in the course. In addition to each student’s name, there are three variables. The first says what major a student has chosen. The second variable gives the student’s total points out of 500 for the course, and the third records the grade received.

Statistics deals with numbers, but not all variables are numerical. Some are「categorical」and simply place an individual into one of several groups or categories. Of the three variables in the professor’s data set, only total points has numbers as its values. Major and grade are categorical, and to do statistics with these variables, we use counts or percentages. We might give the percentage of students who got an A, for example, or the percentage who are psychology majors.

Bad judgment in choosing variables can lead to data that cost lots of time and money but don’t shed light on the world. What constitutes good judgment can be controversial. Here are examples of the challenges in deciding what data to collect.

统计学是关于数据的科学。我们甚至可以说它是「数据的艺术」，因为只有通过正确的判断乃至好的品位和扎实的数学知识，才能得出好的统计数据。好的判断中的一大部分取决于你应该度量什么，以使得出的数据有助于解释你所关心的问题。我们先从一些与数据相关的基本术语入手。

个体与变量 —— 个体是一组数据所描述的对象。个体可以是一群人，也可以是一些动物或者其他物品。变量指的是某一个体的特征，不同个体的变量可以取不同的值。

1『对应于编程里的对象和属性。（2020-11-21）』

举个例子，这是统计学课程结束时，教授手中的成绩数据库中的头几行：

在这里，个体指的是选修这门课程的学生。除了学生的姓名之外，还有三个变量。第一个变量是这名学生的专业，第二个变量是该名学生所得的分数（总分为 500 分），第三个变量是该名学生的成绩等级。尽管统计学是和数字打交道，但并非所有的变量都要用数字表示。有些变量代表的是「类别」，只需将个体归入不同的组别或种类即可。在这个例子的三个变量中，只有总分数是用数值表示的，专业和等级都是类别变量。统计类别变量时，我们采用的是计数或者百分比的方式。例如，我们可以给出得到等级 A 的学生的百分比，或者给出主修心理学的学生的百分比。

选择变量时的错误判断，可能导致在数据上浪费大量时间和金钱却徒劳无功。怎样才能做出好的判断，这可能是个富有争议性的问题。下面的例子展示了在判断应该收集哪些数据时面临的挑战。

#### Example 1 Who recycles?

Who takes the trouble to recycle? Researchers spent lots of time and money weighing the stuff put out for recycling in two neighborhoods in a California city; call them Upper Crust and Lower Mid. The individuals here are households because trash and recycling pickup are done for residences, not for people one at a time. The variable measured was the weight in pounds of the curbside recycling basket each week.

The Upper Crust households contributed more pounds per week on the average than did the folks in Lower Mid. Can we say that the rich are more serious about recycling? No. Someone noticed that Upper Crust recycling baskets contained lots of heavy glass wine bottles. In Lower Mid, they put out lots of light plastic soda bottles and light metal beer and soda cans. The conclusion: weight tells us little about commitment to recycling.

是谁不嫌麻烦地在做资源回收呢？在加利福尼亚州某个城市的两个社区，暂且命名为「上流社区」和「中低社区」，实验人员花费了大量的时间和金钱，将住户拿到屋外的垃圾过磅称重。因为垃圾和回收物的数量是按照住户而不是人头计算，在这里，个体就是两个社区的所有住户，变量是每周路边回收箱里垃圾的重量。

「上流社区」每周平均的垃圾重量要比「中低社区」大，我们是否可以据此说富人更严肃地对待垃圾回收这件事呢？不能。有人注意到，「上流社区」的垃圾桶里有很多沉重的玻璃酒瓶。而在「中低社区」，人们扔进垃圾箱的多是轻质塑料汽水瓶和啤酒铝罐。结论是，重量很难告诉我们人们履行资源回收承诺的实际情况。

#### Example 2 What’s your race?

The U.S. Census asks,「What is this person’s race?」for every person in every household.「Race」is a variable, and the Census Bureau must say exactly how to measure it. The census form does this by giving a list of races. Years of political squabbling lie behind this list.

How many races shall we list, and what names shall we use for them? Shall we have a category for people of mixed race? Asians wanted more national categories, such as Filipino and Vietnamese, for the growing Asian population. Pacific Islanders wanted to be separated from the larger Asian group. Black leaders did not want a mixed-race category, fearing that many blacks would choose it and so reduce the official count of the black population.

The 2010 census form (see Figure 1.1) ended up with six Asian groups (plus「Other Asian」) and three Pacific Island groups (plus「Other Pacific Islander」). There is no「mixed-race」group, but you can mark more than one race. That is, people claiming mixed race can count as both so that the total of the racial group counts in 2010 is larger than the population count. Unable to decide what the proper term for blacks should be, the Census Bureau settled on「Black, African American, or Negro.」What about Hispanics? That’s a separate question because Hispanics can be of any race. Again unable to choose a short name that would satisfy everyone, the Census Bureau decided to ask if you are of「Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin.」

全美人口普查时调查人员会问「你属于哪个种族」，每个家庭成员都要回答这一问题。「种族」是一个变量，美国人口普查局必须给出种族的准确定义。普查表格上列出了一个种族名单，多年来美国政治能够顺顺当当不出问题，主要归功于这个名单。

名单上应该列出多少个种族？用什么名称来代表它们？需要把混合种族列为一个独立的类别吗？亚裔人想要划分出更多的种族，比如菲律宾人和越南人，因为亚裔人口一直在增长。太平洋岛国的人希望与其他较大的亚洲族群分开。黑人领袖不希望出现混合种族类别，因为担心太多的黑人选择这个类别，将减少黑人人口的官方统计数量。

2010 年的普查表（图 1–1）最终列出了 6 个亚洲族群（加上「其他亚裔人」）和 3 个太平洋岛国族群（加上「其他太平洋岛国人」），表上没有出现混合种族一项，但人们可以选择多个选项。也就是说，填报混合种族的人可能会被计入多个族群，因此这个数据会比总人口大。因为无法确定如何称呼黑色人种，人口普查局用了「黑色皮肤，非裔美国人或黑人」这一说法。拉丁裔呢？这是另外一个问题，因为他们可能属于任何一个种族，而且无法找到一个能让所有人都满意的说法来代表他们。因此，只能问人们是否属于「西班牙裔、拉丁裔或祖先来自西班牙」。

在种族问题上存在的争执提醒我们，数据反映了社会。种族是一个社会概念，而不是一个生物学事实。在普查中，你可以决定自己属于哪个种族。种族在美国是一个敏感问题，出现争执也不足为奇。人口普查局的方法似乎是一种不错的折中之策。

### 1.2 Observational Studies

As Yogi Berra, the former catcher and manager of the New York Yankees who is renowned for his humorous quotes, said,「You can observe a lot by watching.」Sometimes all you can do is watch. To learn how chimpanzees in the wild behave, watch. To study how a teacher and young children interact in a schoolroom, watch. It helps if the watcher knows what to look for. The chimpanzee expert may be interested in how males and females interact, in whether some chimps in the troop are dominant, in whether the chimps hunt and eat meat. Indeed, chimps were thought to be vegetarians until Jane Goodall watched them carefully in Gombe National Park, Tanzania. Now it is clear that meat is a natural part of the chimpanzee diet.

At first, the observer may not know what to record. Eventually, patterns seem to emerge, and we can decide what variables we want to measure. How often do chimpanzees hunt? Alone or in groups? How large are hunting groups? Males alone, or both males and females? How much of the diet is meat? Observation that is organized and measures clearly defined variables is more convincing than just watching. Here is an example of highly organized (and expensive) observation.

纽约扬基队的前接球手和经理约吉·贝拉，以其幽默的话语为人所知。他曾说：「你只要观察，就能看到很多东西。」有的时候，你能做的也只有观察了。想知道黑猩猩在野外的行为，你得观察。想研究老师和小朋友在教室中的互动行为，你也得观察。若观察者知道自己应该看的是什么，就会容易一些。黑猩猩专家可能对雌猩猩和雄猩猩的相互影响有兴趣，或者想知道黑猩猩群中的某几只黑猩猩是否有统治权，以及黑猩猩会不会猎食动物。事实上，大家一直以为黑猩猩是食草动物，直到珍妮·古道尔在坦桑尼亚的贡贝国家公园仔细观察了它们的行为。现在人们已经清楚地知道，肉类是黑猩猩日常饮食的一部分。

刚开始的时候，观察者可能不知道应该记录些什么。然而迟早会出现一些模式，帮助我们决定应该衡量哪些变量。比如，黑猩猩多久猎食一次？单独行动还是群体行动？多少只一起行动？只有雄性还是雌、雄都有？在它们的食物中肉类占多大比重？系统地观察，再加上清楚地定义变量，会比只观察更有说服力。以下是一个计划完善（且很花钱）的观察研究案例。

#### Example 3 Do power lines cause leukemia in children?

Electric currents generate magnetic fields. So, living with electricity exposes people to magnetic fields. Living near power lines increases exposure to these fields. Really strong fields can disturb living cells in laboratory studies. What about the weaker fields we experience if we live near power lines? Some data suggested that more children in these locations might develop leukemia, a cancer of the blood cells.

We can’t do experiments that deliberately expose children to magnetic fields for weeks and months at a time. It’s hard to compare cancer rates among children who happen to live in more and less exposed locations because leukemia is quite rare and locations vary a lot in many ways other than magnetic fields. It is easier to start with children who have leukemia and compare them with children who don’t. We can look at lots of possible causes—diet, pesticides, drinking water, magnetic fields, and others—to see where children with leukemia differ from those without. Some of these broad studies suggested a closer look at magnetic fields.

One really careful look at magnetic fields took five years and cost `$5` million. The researchers compared 638 children who had leukemia and 620 who did not. They went into the homes and actually measured the magnetic fields in the children’s bedrooms, in other rooms, and at the front door. They recorded facts about nearby power lines for the family home and also for the mother’s residence when she was pregnant. Result: no evidence of more than a chance connection between magnetic fields and childhood leukemia. Similar conclusions were reached by researchers at the University of Oxford in England who reviewed data from 1962–2008 and by researchers in California who reviewed data in California from 1986–2008.

Key Terms —— A response variable is a variable that measures an outcome or result of a study. An observational study observes individuals and measures variables of interest but does not intervene to influence the responses. The purpose of an observational study is to describe some group or situation.

「No evidence」that magnetic fields are connected with childhood leukemia doesn’t prove that there is no risk. It says only that a very careful study could not find any risk that stands out from the play of chance that distributes leukemia cases across the landscape. In other words, the study could not rule out chance as a plausible explanation for what was observed. Critics continue to argue that the study failed to measure some important variables or that the children studied don’t fairly represent all children. Nonetheless, a carefully designed observational study is a great advance over haphazard and sometimes emotional counting of cancer cases.

电流产生磁场，所以电力会让人们暴露在磁场之中，住在高压电缆附近则增加了这种暴露的程度。强磁场确实会干扰实验室里做研究用的活细胞。如果我们住在高压电缆附近，那么磁场会对我们产生何种影响呢？一些数据表明，住在这种环境里，可能会有更多的儿童患上白血病。

我们不能为了做实验而让孩子们几周或者几个月暴露在高压电缆的磁场中。由于白血病比较少见，而且除了磁场之外，居住地之间还有很多不同，因此对于住在或多或少暴露在磁场中的住所的儿童，很难比较癌症发病率。较为简单的方法是从那些已患白血病的儿童着手，把他们和未患白血病的儿童做比较。我们可以查找许多可能的原因，例如食物、杀虫剂、饮用水、磁场等，看看这些患白血病的儿童和正常儿童有何不同。这些广泛的研究表明，我们有必要对磁场做进一步深入研究。

最终，有人花了 5 年时间和 500 万美元，对磁场进行了极为细致的研究。实验人员调查了 638 名白血病患儿和 620 名未患白血病的儿童的情况。实验人员走访了这些儿童的家，在他们的卧室和其他房间，以及房子的前门处测量了磁场强度。实验人员不仅对这些儿童住所附近的高压电缆情况做了记录，还对这些孩子的母亲在怀孕时的住处附近的高压电缆的情况也做了记录。结论是，没有任何证据证明磁场和儿童患白血病之间存在相关性。

「没有证据」显示磁场和儿童患白血病有关，但这并不表示暴露在磁场下就完全没有风险，而是说在经过非常严谨的研究之后，不能得出「磁场有导致儿童患白血病的风险」的结论。换言之，该项研究不能为观察到的结果提供有说服力的证据。有些批评家认为这个研究漏掉了一些重要的变量，或者参与研究的儿童不具有代表性。不过，一个有详尽计划的观察研究，肯定比随口，甚至带有情绪化地说出几个癌症病例，更令人信服。

反应变量与观察研究 —— 反应变量是用来表示研究结果的变量。观察研究指的是观察一些个体，并衡量我们感兴趣的变量，但并不试图影响反应变量。观察研究的目的是描述一个群体或一种状况。

知识普及 —— 你可能会大吃一惊，一个对记者和科学家的抽样调查竟然会发现巨大的沟通鸿沟。记者认为科学家骄傲自大，而科学家认为记者愚昧无知。我们无意偏向哪一边，但从这项抽样调查中得出了一个有趣的结果：82% 的科学家认为「媒体对于统计学的了解很少，无法对医药和其他领域的新发现做出客观的阐释」。

### 1.3 Sample Surveys

Statistics in Your World —— You just don’t understand A sample survey of journalists and scientists found quite a communications gap. Journalists think that scientists are arrogant, while scientists think that journalists are ignorant. We won’t take sides, but here is one interesting result from the survey: 82% of the scientists agree that the「media do not understand statistics well enough to explain new findings」in medicine and other fields.

You don’t have to eat the entire pot of soup to know it needs more salt. That is the idea of sampling: to gain information about the whole by examining only a part. Sample surveys are an important kind of observational study. They survey some group of individuals by studying only some of its members, selected not because they are of special interest but because they represent the larger group. Here is the vocabulary we use to discuss sampling.

Key Terms —— The population in a statistical study is the entire group of individuals about which we want information. A sample is the part of the population from which we actually collect information and is used to draw conclusions about the whole.

Notice that the population is the group we want to study. If we want information about all U.S. college students, that is our population—even if students at only one college are available for sampling. To make sense of any sample result, you must know what population the sample represents. Did a preelection poll, for example, ask the opinions of all adults? Or citizens only? Registered voters only? Democrats only? The sample consists of the people we actually have information about. If the poll can’t contact some of the people it selected, those people aren’t in the sample.

The distinction between population and sample is basic to statistics. The following examples illustrate this distinction and also introduce some major uses of sampling. These brief descriptions also indicate the variables measured for each individual in the sample.

有句谚语说：「你不必吃完整头牛，就能知道肉老。」这就是抽样调查的精髓，即通过一部分获知全体的情况。「抽样调查」（sample survey）是一种很重要的观察研究方法。他们只研究目标对象中的一部分人，选中这些人并不是因为实验人员对他们特别感兴趣，而是因为他们具有代表性。以下是用来讨论抽样的词汇。

总体和样本 —— 总体（population）是指我们研究的全体对象。样本（sample）是总体的一部分，我们从样本中搜集信息，以便对总体做出推断。

请注意，总体就是我们想研究的所有目标对象。如果我们想得到关于美国大学生的信息，那么所有美国大学生就是我们的总体；即使在选取样本时，因受条件所限只能从一所大学里抽样，总体仍然不变。要想从样本中得出结论，必须先知道该样本代表的总体是什么。比如说，选前民意调查到底问了哪些人的意见？是所有成年人，美国公民，已登记的选民，还是民主党人？样本只包括我们成功获取信息的那些人，如果在调查中有些被选中的人联络不上，那么这些人就不包括在样本中。

总体和样本的区别，在统计学里是很基本的知识。以下的例子会说明总体和样本的区别，介绍抽样调查的一些主要用途，还会指出我们对样本中的个体进行衡量所涉及的变量。

#### Example 4 Public opinion polls

Polls such as those conducted by Gallup and many news organizations ask people’s opinions on a variety of issues. The variables measured are responses to questions about public issues. Though most noticed at election time, these polls are conducted on a regular basis throughout the year. For a typical opinion poll:

Population: U.S. residents 18 years of age and over. Noncitizens and even undocumented immigrants are included.

Sample: Between 1000 and 1500 people interviewed by telephone.

盖洛普和许多新闻机构经常进行民意调查，询问人们对各种问题的看法。此处要测量的变量，就是人们对公共问题的看法。尽管在选举期间特别受关注，但其实这类民意调查每年都会定期开展。

总体：18 岁及以上的美国居民，其中包括非美国公民，以及非法移民。

样本：通过电话访谈的 1000-1500 人。

#### Example 5 The Current Population Survey

Government economic and social data come from large sample surveys of a nation’s individuals, households, or businesses. The monthly Current Population Survey (CPS) is the most important government sample survey in the United States. Many of the variables recorded by the CPS concern the employment or unemployment of everyone over 16 years old in a household. The government’s monthly unemployment rate comes from the CPS. The CPS also records many other economic and social variables. For the CPS:

Population: The more than 126 million U.S. households. Notice that the individuals are households rather than people or families. A household consists of all people who share the same living quarters, regardless of how they are related to each other.

Sample: About 60,000 households interviewed each month.

美国政府的经济和社会数据，来自对全美国的个人、住户或企业所做的大规模抽样调查。美国最重要的政府抽样调查是每月一次的「当前人口调查」（Current Population Survey，CPS）。在当前人口调查记录的变量中，有许多和住户中 16 岁以上人口的就业状况有关。政府公布的每月失业率就来自于当前人口调查，当前人口调查也记录了其他经济和社会变量。

总体：超过 1.17 亿个美国住户。请注意这里指的是住户，而不是个人或家庭。一个住户是由所有住在同一所房子中的人组成的，不管他们之间是否有血缘关系。

样本：每月走访的大约 60000 个住户。

#### Example 6 TV ratings

Market research is designed to discover what consumers want and what products they use. One example of market research is the television-rating service of Nielsen Media Research. The Nielsen ratings influence how much advertisers will pay to sponsor a program and whether or not the program stays on the air. For the Nielsen national TV ratings:

Population: The more than 119 million U.S. households that have a television set.

Sample: About 75,000 households that agree to use a「people meter」to record the TV viewing of all people in the household.

The variables recorded include the number of people in the household and their age and sex, whether the TV set is in use at each time period, and, if so, what program is being watched and who is watching it.

「市场调查」（market research）被用于了解消费者的喜好和他们的产品使用情况。市场调查的一个典型例子就是尼尔森媒介研究所做的电视收视率调查。尼尔森给出的结果关系到广告商愿意花多少钱购买某个节目的广告时间，以及这个节目是否还会继续播下去。

总体：超过 1.14 亿个拥有电视机的住户。

样本：大约 25000 个同意尼尔森公司用收视率记录仪采集他们观看电视节目情况的住户。

所记录的变量包括住户的人数、年龄和性别，是否每个时段都开着电视机，以及谁在看、看什么节目。

#### Example 7 The General Social Survey

Social science research makes heavy use of sampling. The General Social Survey (GSS), carried out every second year by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago, is the most important social science sample survey. The variables cover the subject’s personal and family background, experiences and habits, and attitudes and opinions on subjects from abortion to war.

Population: Adults (aged 18 and over) living in households in the United States. The population does not include adults in institutions such as prisons and college dormitories. It also does not include persons who cannot be interviewed in English.

Sample: About 3000 adults interviewed in person in their homes.

「综合社会调查」（General Social Survey，GSS）一般由芝加哥大学全国民意研究中心每隔一年进行一次，是最重要的社会科学抽样调查。调查变量涉及调查对象的个人和家庭背景、经历和习惯，以及对从堕胎到战争的各种话题的态度和看法。

总体：美国住户中的成年人（18 岁及以上），不包括诸如监狱囚犯和住在学校宿舍的成年人，也不包括无法用英语交流的人。

样本：大约 3000 名在住所中接受调查的成年人。

Now it’s your turn.

1.1 Legalizing marijuana. The Pew Research Center conducted a poll October 25–30, 2017. They asked:

Do you think the use of marijuana should be made legal or not?

The Pew Research Center reported that the poll consisted of telephone interviews with 1504 randomly selected adult Americans. What do you think the population is? What is the sample?

Most statistical studies use samples in the broad sense. For example, the 638 children with leukemia in Example 3 are supposed to represent all children with leukemia. We usually reserve the dignified term「sample survey」for studies that use an organized plan to choose a sample that represents some specific population. The children with leukemia were patients at centers that specialize in treating children’s cancer. Expert judgment says they are typical of all leukemia patients, even though they come only from special types of hospitals. A sample survey doesn’t rely on judgment: it starts with an entire population and uses specific, quantifiable methods to choose a sample to represent the population. Chapters 2, 3, and 4 discuss the art and science of sample surveys.

1.1 联邦政府资助。美国有线电视新闻网民意调查公司在 2010.09.01-2010.09.02 做了一项民意调查，他们问：a）你认为联邦政府是否应该资助从人体胚胎中提取干细胞的研究？b）美国有线电视新闻网民意调查报告说对 1024 名随机挑选的美国成年人进行了电话访谈，你认为这个调查的总体是什么？样本是什么？

大部分统计研究使用的样本都是「广义」的样本。比如，例 3 中的 638 个白血病患儿被视为所有白血病患儿的代表。我们通常把「抽样调查」这个词留到有计划地抽取样本，对总体进行研究的时候才用。那些白血病患儿是专门治疗儿童癌症的治疗中心的病人，专家认为，即使他们全都来自一些特殊的医院，也可以代表所有的白血病患儿。抽样调查可不能依赖专家观点，而要从一个总体开始，采用可以量化的特定方法从中抽取能代表总体的样本。从第 2 章到第 4 章，我们将专门讨论抽样调查这门艺术和科学。

### 1.4 Census

Key Terms —— A census is a sample survey that attempts to include the entire population in the sample. A sample survey looks at only a part of the population. Why not look at the entire population? A census tries to do this.

The U.S. Constitution requires a census of the American population every 10 years. A census of so large a population is expensive and takes a long time. Even the federal government, which can afford a census, uses samples such as the Current Population Survey to produce timely data on employment and many other variables. If the government asked every adult in the country about his or her employment, this month’s unemployment rate would be available next year rather than next month. In fact, to save money, the 2010 census consisted of only 10 questions. Five of these were general questions, and five required answers for every person living at the address the form was sent to.

Statistics in Your World —— Is a census old-fashioned? The United States has taken a census every 10 years since 1790. Technology marches on, however, and replacements for a national census look promising. Denmark has no census, and France plans to eliminate its census. Denmark has a national register of all its residents, who carry identification cards and change their register entry whenever they move. France will replace its census by a large sample survey that rotates among the nation’s regions. The U.S. Census Bureau has a similar idea: the American Community Survey has already started and has eliminated the census「long form.」In 2011, Canada eliminated its long-form census and replaced it with a controversial voluntary National Household Survey. But in 2016, Canada reintroduced the long form.

So time and money favor samples over a census. Samples can have other advantages as well. If you are testing fireworks or fuses, the sampled items are destroyed. Moreover, a sample can produce more accurate data than a census. A careful sample of an inventory of spare parts will almost certainly give more accurate results than asking the clerks to count all 500,000 parts in the warehouse. Bored people do not count accurately.

The experience of the Census Bureau reminds us that a census can only attempt to sample the entire population. The bureau estimated that the 2010 census overcounted the American population by 0.01% but undercounted the black population by 2.1%. A census is not foolproof, even with the resources of the government behind it. Why take a census at all? The government needs block-by-block population figures to create election districts with equal populations. The main function of the U.S. census is to provide this local information.

抽样调查只观察总体的一部分，为什么不观察全部呢？普查才需要观察总体。

普查 —— 普查（census）是试图把总体纳入样本的抽样调查。

美国宪法规定每 10 年要做一次全国人口普查。要对这么大的总体做普查，既费钱又耗时。即使美国联邦政府负担得起普查费用，仍然还得利用抽样调查的方法，比如通过当前人口调查获取失业率及其他许多变量的即时数据。若政府真的询问全美每一个成人的工作状况，那么这个月的失业率数据恐怕要等到明年才会得到。为了省钱，2010 年的普查只有 10 个问题，其中 5 个是常规问题，另外 5 个问题要求被调查的住户中的所有人都要回答。

所以，从时间和金钱的角度来看，抽样调查比普查划算，而且抽样调查还有其他优点。假如你要测试烟花或保险丝的功能是否正常，最好使用抽样调查法，因为测试过的产品就不能用了。还有，比起普查，抽样调查反而可能会得到更精确的结果。派职员去检查所有 50 万个零配件是否合格，不如让他仔细做一个样本抽查，人在烦躁的时候是不会得到准确结果的。

美国人口普查局的经验提醒我们，普查只能「试图」对总体进行抽样调查。在写本书的时候，美国 2010 年的普查结果还未公布，但人口普查局估计 2000 年普查遗漏了 0.12% 的美国人口，其中包括 2.78% 的黑人，他们大多住在内陆城市。即使有政府的强大资源做后盾，普查也不能做到不出错。那么，为什么要做普查呢？政府需要每个街区的详细资料，才能划分出人数大致相同的选区。美国人口普查的主要作用，就是提供这些本地信息。

知识普及 —— 普查是否过时了？

美国从 1790 年开始，每 10 年进行一次人口普查。但是，科技日新月异，全国性人口普查很有可能被其他方式取代。丹麦没有人口普查，法国也准备取消人口普查。丹麦对全国居民进行登记，居民有身份证，只要搬家就得变更登记信息。法国打算用一个大型抽样调查取代人口普查，这个调查将在不同的区域轮流进行。美国人口普查局也有类似的想法，美国社区调查（American Community Survey）项目已经启动，而且繁杂的普查问卷在 2000 年就被取消了。

### 1.5 Experiments

Our goal in choosing a sample is a picture of the population, disturbed as little as possible by the act of gathering information. All observational studies share the principle「observe but don’t disturb.」When Jane Goodall first began observing chimpanzees in Tanzania, she set up a feeding station where the chimps could eat bananas. She later said that was a mistake because it might have changed the apes’ behavior.

Key Terms —— An experiment deliberately imposes some treatment on individuals in order to observe their responses. The purpose of an experiment is to study whether the treatment causes a change in the response.

In experiments, on the other hand, we want to change behavior. In doing an experiment, we don’t just observe individuals or ask them questions. We actively impose some treatment in order to observe the response. Experiments can answer questions such as「Does aspirin reduce the chance of a heart attack?」and「Do a majority of college students prefer Pepsi to Coke when they taste both without knowing which they are drinking?」

抽取样本的目的，是为了了解总体的真实情况，而且在搜集信息时应尽量避免受到干扰。所有观察研究都遵循同一原则：观察就好，但别干扰。当珍妮·古道尔刚开始在坦桑尼亚观察黑猩猩时，曾设立了一个食物补给站，黑猩猩在那里可以吃到香蕉。随后她便认识到这个做法不对，因为这很有可能会改变黑猩猩的行为。「现在吃那根香蕉吧，那位和善的统计专家正盯着我们看呢。」

另一方面，我们做某些实验的目的就是要改变行为。在实验过程中，我们不只是观察个体或者问他们问题，而是刻意做了某些处理，以便观察其反应。实验可以帮助我们解答诸如「阿司匹林能降低心脏病发作的风险吗」，「如果让大学生在看不到商标的情况下品尝百事可乐和可口可乐，大部分学生会更喜欢百事可乐吗」之类的问题。

实验 —— 实验（experiment）中实验人员会刻意对某些个体进行某些处理（treatment），以观察其反应。实验的目的是研究某个特定的处理是否会导致个体的反应发生变化。

#### Example 8 Helping welfare mothers find jobs

The Urban Institute in Washington DC reports that most adult welfare recipients are single mothers in their 20s and 30s with one or two children. Observational studies of welfare mothers show that many are able to increase their earnings and leave the welfare system. Some take advantage of voluntary job-training programs to improve their skills. Should participation in job-training and job-search programs be required of all able-bodied welfare mothers? Observational studies of the current system cannot tell us what the effects of such a policy would be. Even if the mothers studied are a properly chosen sample of all welfare recipients, those who seek out training and find jobs may differ in many ways from those who do not. They are observed to have more education, for example, but they may also differ in values and motivation, things that cannot be observed.

To see if a required jobs program will help mothers escape welfare, such a program must actually be tried. Choose two similar groups of mothers when they apply for welfare. Require one group to participate in a job-training program, but do not offer the program to the other group. This is an experiment. Comparing the income and work record of the two groups after several years will show whether requiring training has the desired effect.

华盛顿特区城市研究所报告说，大多数领取福利救济的成年人都是有一个或两个孩子的二三十岁的单身母亲。针对这些领取福利救济的母亲的观察研究表明，大部分人都有工作能力，有些人还自愿参加工作培训以提高自身的工作技能。是否应该要求所有身体健康的领取福利救济的妈妈们都参加工作培训和找工作呢？这项观察研究无法告诉我们这样的政策会产生什么影响。就算这项观察的对象是所有领取福利救济的母亲们的一个合适的样本，那些参加培训和找工作的母亲也可能在很多方面与其他没这样做的母亲存在差异。例如，实验人员从观察中了解到前者接受过更多的教育，她们也有可能在价值观和动机方面不同于后者，而这些特征是无法观察到的。

想要知道这样的计划能否帮助那些母亲脱离福利救济，可以采用这样的方法：选择两组申请福利救济的母亲，要求其中一组参加工作培训，而另一组不参加。这是一个实验。若干年后，通过比较两组人的收入和工作记录就可以看出，要求她们参加工作培训是否能达到我们预期的效果。

1.2 Diet soda and weight. Many people drink diet soda to control their weight. To explore the relationship between drinking diet soda and weight, medical researchers recruited 400 adults who identified themselves as diet soda drinkers. These 400 participants recorded how many bottles or cans of diet soda they drank per week over a period of two years. Each participant was weighed at the beginning and end of this two-year period. The researchers found that the more diet soda one drank, the more likely one was to have gained weight during the two-year period. The results were published in a well-known scientific journal. Was this an observational study or an experiment?

The welfare example illustrates the big advantage of experiments over observational studies: in principle, experiments can give good evidence for cause and effect. If we design the experiment properly, we start with two very similar groups of welfare mothers. The individual women of course differ from each other in age, education, number of children, and other respects. But the two groups resemble each other when we look at the ages, years of education, and number of children for all women in each group. During the experiment, the women’s lives differ, but there is only one systematic difference between the two groups: whether or not they are in the jobs program. All live through the same good or bad economic times, the same changes in public attitudes, and so on. If the training group does much better than the untrained group in holding jobs and earning money, we can say that the training program actually causes this happy outcome.

One of the big ideas of statistics is that experiments can give good evidence that a treatment causes a response. A big idea needs a big caution: statistical conclusions hold「on the average」for groups of individuals. They don’t tell us much about one individual. If on the average the women in the training program earned more than those who were left out, that says that the program achieved its goal. It doesn’t say that every woman in such a program will be helped. And a big idea may also raise big questions: if we hope the training will raise earnings, is it ethical to offer it to some women and not to others? Chapters 5 and 6 explain how to design good experiments, and Chapter 7 looks at ethical issues.

1.2 把讲义上传到班级网站上。为了确定怎样做对学生的帮助最大，一位教育研究者查阅了他所教的几个班级的学生的网上留言，他发现学生们提到最多的是教师讲义被上传到班级网站上供大家下载这件事。于是，该研究者建议教师将讲义上传至班级网站。这是一个观察研究还是一项实验？

福利救济的例子说明，实验比观察研究更有效。从原则上说，实验可以为「因果关系」（cause and effect）的存在与否提供良好的证据。如果我们适当地设计实验，就可以从两组较为相似的领取福利救济的母亲开始。她们之间当然会存在年龄、受教育程度、子女人数及其他方面的差别。但是，当我们检视两组中所有实验对象的年龄、受教育程度、子女人数时，发现这两个组的情况很接近。实验过程中，虽然她们的生活都不一样，但是两组实验对象之间只有一项「系统性差异」（systematic difference），那就是一组参加了工作培训，而另一组没有。大家都经过了同样的经济繁荣或不景气的状况，以及观念的改变，等等。如果参加培训的那一组在工作表现和赚钱方面都远胜另一组，我们就可以说参加工作培训确实带来了令人满意的结果。

实验可以提供好的证据，证明某项处理的确产生了某种反应，这是统计学的一个重要概念。这个概念还附带了一个重要的提醒：统计结论是针对一群个体从「平均的角度」（on the average）得出的结论，而非针对任何特定的个体。从平均的角度看，参加工作培训的实验对象的收入比没参加的人高。这说明我们预期的目标达成了，但并不代表每个参加培训的人都会受益。这个概念也会引发一个大大的疑问：如果我们希望工作培训计划能增加实验对象的收入，那么，只让某些女性参加，却不让其他人参加，会不会有点儿不道德？在第 5 章和第 6 章中，我们将会说明怎样设计好的实验，在第 7 章中我们将会讨论相关的伦理问题。
