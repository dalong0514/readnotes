When most people hear “Machine Learning,” they picture a robot: a dependable butler or a deadly Terminator depending on who you ask. But Machine Learning is not just a futuristic fantasy, it’s already here. In fact, it has been around for decades in some specialized applications, such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR). But the first ML application that really became mainstream, improving the lives of hundreds of millions of people, took over the world back in the 1990s: it was the spam filter. Not exactly a self-aware Skynet, but it does technically qualify as Machine Learning (it has actually learned so well that you seldom need to flag an email as spam anymore). It was followed by hundreds of ML applications that now quietly power hundreds of products and features that you use regularly, from better recommendations to voice search.

Where does Machine Learning start and where does it end? What exactly does it mean for a machine to learn something? If I download a copy of Wikipedia, has my computer really “learned” something? Is it suddenly smarter? In this chapter we will start by clarifying what Machine Learning is and why you may want to use it.

Then, before we set out to explore the Machine Learning continent, we will take a look at the map and learn about the main regions and the most notable landmarks: supervised versus unsupervised learning, online versus batch learning, instancebased versus model-based learning. Then we will look at the workflow of a typical ML project, discuss the main challenges you may face, and cover how to evaluate and fine-tune a Machine Learning system.

This chapter introduces a lot of fundamental concepts (and jargon) that every data scientist should know by heart. It will be a high-level overview (the only chapter without much code), all rather simple, but you should make sure everything is crystal-clear to you before continuing to the rest of the book. So grab a coffee and let’s get started!

If you already know all the Machine Learning basics, you may want to skip directly to Chapter 2. If you are not sure, try to answer all the questions listed at the end of the chapter before moving on.

### 1.1 What Is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is the science (and art) of programming computers so they can learn from data.

Here is a slightly more general definition:

[Machine Learning is the] field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

—Arthur Samuel, 1959

And a more engineering-oriented one:

A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

—Tom Mitchell, 1997

For example, your spam filter is a Machine Learning program that can learn to flag spam given examples of spam emails (e.g., flagged by users) and examples of regular (nonspam, also called “ham”) emails. The examples that the system uses to learn are called the training set. Each training example is called a training instance (or sample). In this case, the task T is to flag spam for new emails, the experience E is the training data, and the performance measure P needs to be defined; for example, you can use the ratio of correctly classified emails. This particular performance measure is called accuracy and it is often used in classification tasks.

If you just download a copy of Wikipedia, your computer has a lot more data, but it is not suddenly better at any task. Thus, it is not Machine Learning.

### 1.2 Why Use Machine Learning?

Consider how you would write a spam filter using traditional programming techniques (Figure 1-1):

1 First you would look at what spam typically looks like. You might notice that some words or phrases (such as “4U,” “credit card,” “free,” and “amazing”) tend to come up a lot in the subject. Perhaps you would also notice a few other patterns in the sender’s name, the email’s body, and so on.

2 You would write a detection algorithm for each of the patterns that you noticed, and your program would flag emails as spam if a number of these patterns are detected.

3 You would test your program, and repeat steps 1 and 2 until it is good enough.

Figure 1-1. The traditional approach

Since the problem is not trivial, your program will likely become a long list of complex rules—pretty hard to maintain.

In contrast, a spam filter based on Machine Learning techniques automatically learns which words and phrases are good predictors of spam by detecting unusually frequent patterns of words in the spam examples compared to the ham examples (Figure 1-2). The program is much shorter, easier to maintain, and most likely more accurate.

Figure 1-2. Machine Learning approach

Moreover, if spammers notice that all their emails containing “4U” are blocked, they might start writing “For U” instead. A spam filter using traditional programming techniques would need to be updated to flag “For U” emails. If spammers keep working around your spam filter, you will need to keep writing new rules forever.

In contrast, a spam filter based on Machine Learning techniques automatically notices that “For U” has become unusually frequent in spam flagged by users, and it starts flagging them without your intervention (Figure 1-3).

Figure 1-3. Automatically adapting to change

Another area where Machine Learning shines is for problems that either are too complex for traditional approaches or have no known algorithm. For example, consider speech recognition: say you want to start simple and write a program capable of distinguishing the words “one” and “two.” You might notice that the word “two” starts with a high-pitch sound (“T”), so you could hardcode an algorithm that measures high-pitch sound intensity and use that to distinguish ones and twos. Obviously this technique will not scale to thousands of words spoken by millions of very different people in noisy environments and in dozens of languages. The best solution (at least today) is to write an algorithm that learns by itself, given many example recordings for each word.

Finally, Machine Learning can help humans learn (Figure 1-4): ML algorithms can be inspected to see what they have learned (although for some algorithms this can be tricky). For instance, once the spam filter has been trained on enough spam, it can easily be inspected to reveal the list of words and combinations of words that it believes are the best predictors of spam. Sometimes this will reveal unsuspected correlations or new trends, and thereby lead to a better understanding of the problem.

Applying ML techniques to dig into large amounts of data can help discover patterns that were not immediately apparent. This is called data mining.

Figure 1-4. Machine Learning can help humans learn

To summarize, Machine Learning is great for:

• Problems for which existing solutions require a lot of hand-tuning or long lists of rules: one Machine Learning algorithm can often simplify code and perform better.

• Complex problems for which there is no good solution at all using a traditional approach: the best Machine Learning techniques can find a solution.

• Fluctuating environments: a Machine Learning system can adapt to new data.

• Getting insights about complex problems and large amounts of data.

### 1.3 Types of Machine Learning Systems

There are so many different types of Machine Learning systems that it is useful to classify them in broad categories based on:

• Whether or not they are trained with human supervision (supervised, unsupervised, semisupervised, and Reinforcement Learning)

• Whether or not they can learn incrementally on the fly (online versus batch learning)

• Whether they work by simply comparing new data points to known data points, or instead detect patterns in the training data and build a predictive model, much like scientists do (instance-based versus model-based learning)

These criteria are not exclusive; you can combine them in any way you like. For example, a state-of-the-art spam filter may learn on the fly using a deep neural network model trained using examples of spam and ham; this makes it an online, modelbased, supervised learning system. Let’s look at each of these criteria a bit more closely.

#### 1.3.1 Supervised/Unsupervised Learning

Machine Learning systems can be classified according to the amount and type of supervision they get during training. There are four major categories: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semisupervised learning, and Reinforcement Learning.

#### Supervised learning

In supervised learning, the training data you feed to the algorithm includes the desired solutions, called labels (Figure 1-5).

Figure 1-5. A labeled training set for supervised learning (e.g., spam classification)

1『明白了，监督式学习的数据都是有「属性」的，即数据已经是被打了标签的，而非监督式学习的数据没有标签。（2020-11-22）』

A typical supervised learning task is classification. The spam filter is a good example of this: it is trained with many example emails along with their class (spam or ham), and it must learn how to classify new emails.

Another typical task is to predict a target numeric value, such as the price of a car, given a set of features (mileage, age, brand, etc.) called predictors. This sort of task is called regression (Figure 1-6). [1] To train the system, you need to give it many examples of cars, including both their predictors and their labels (i.e., their prices).

In Machine Learning an attribute is a data type (e.g., “Mileage”), while a feature has several meanings depending on the context, but generally means an attribute plus its value (e.g., “Mileage = 15,000”). Many people use the words attribute and feature interchangeably, though.

Figure 1-6. Regression

Note that some regression algorithms can be used for classification as well, and vice versa. For example, Logistic Regression is commonly used for classification, as it can output a value that corresponds to the probability of belonging to a given class (e.g., 20% chance of being spam).

Here are some of the most important supervised learning algorithms (covered in this book):

• k-Nearest Neighbors

• Linear Regression

• Logistic Regression

• Support Vector Machines (SVMs)

• Decision Trees and Random Forests

• Neural networks [2] 

1 Fun fact: this odd-sounding name is a statistics term introduced by Francis Galton while he was studying the fact that the children of tall people tend to be shorter than their parents. Since children were shorter, he called this regression to the mean. This name was then applied to the methods he used to analyze correlations between variables.

2 Some neural network architectures can be unsupervised, such as autoencoders and restricted Boltzmann machines. They can also be semisupervised, such as in deep belief networks and unsupervised pretraining.

3『回归这个术语，原来是高尔顿定义的，统计学的鼻祖，哈哈。（2020-11-22）』

#### Unsupervised learning

In unsupervised learning, as you might guess, the training data is unlabeled (Figure 1-7). The system tries to learn without a teacher.

Figure 1-7. An unlabeled training set for unsupervised learning

Here are some of the most important unsupervised learning algorithms (most of these are covered in Chapter 8 and Chapter 9):

• Clustering 

— K-Means 

— DBSCAN 

— Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA)

• Anomaly detection and novelty detection 

— One-class SVM 

— Isolation Forest

• Visualization and dimensionality reduction

— Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

— Kernel PCA

— Locally-Linear Embedding (LLE)

— t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)

• Association rule learning

— Apriori

— Eclat

For example, say you have a lot of data about your blog’s visitors. You may want to run a clustering algorithm to try to detect groups of similar visitors (Figure 1-8). At no point do you tell the algorithm which group a visitor belongs to: it finds those connections without your help. For example, it might notice that 40% of your visitors are males who love comic books and generally read your blog in the evening, while 20% are young sci-fi lovers who visit during the weekends, and so on. If you use a hierarchical clustering algorithm, it may also subdivide each group into smaller groups. This may help you target your posts for each group.

Figure 1-8. Clustering 

Visualization algorithms are also good examples of unsupervised learning algorithms: you feed them a lot of complex and unlabeled data, and they output a 2D or 3D representation of your data that can easily be plotted (Figure 1-9). These algorithms try to preserve as much structure as they can (e.g., trying to keep separate clusters in the input space from overlapping in the visualization), so you can understand how the data is organized and perhaps identify unsuspected patterns.

Figure 1-9. Example of a t-SNE visualization highlighting semantic clusters 3  

A related task is dimensionality reduction, in which the goal is to simplify the data without losing too much information. One way to do this is to merge several correlated features into one. For example, a car’s mileage may be very correlated with its age, so the dimensionality reduction algorithm will merge them into one feature that represents the car’s wear and tear. This is called feature extraction.

It is often a good idea to try to reduce the dimension of your training data using a dimensionality reduction algorithm before you feed it to another Machine Learning algorithm (such as a supervised learning algorithm). It will run much faster, the data will take up less disk and memory space, and in some cases it may also perform better.

1『学到了，在用监督式学习去跑数据前，可以通过 dimensionality reduction 算法去浓缩数据的维度（属性），比如汽车公里数和车龄这 2 个属性提炼成 1 个。（2020-11-22）』

Yet another important unsupervised task is anomaly detection—for example, detecting unusual credit card transactions to prevent fraud, catching manufacturing defects, or automatically removing outliers from a dataset before feeding it to another learning algorithm. The system is shown mostly normal instances during training, so it learns to recognize them and when it sees a new instance it can tell whether it looks like a normal one or whether it is likely an anomaly (see Figure 1-10). A very similar task is novelty detection: the difference is that novelty detection algorithms expect to see only normal data during training, while anomaly detection algorithms are usually more tolerant, they can often perform well even with a small percentage of outliers in the training set.

Figure 1-10. Anomaly detection

Finally, another common unsupervised task is association rule learning, in which the goal is to dig into large amounts of data and discover interesting relations between attributes. For example, suppose you own a supermarket. Running an association rule on your sales logs may reveal that people who purchase barbecue sauce and potato chips also tend to buy steak. Thus, you may want to place these items close to each other.

3 Notice how animals are rather well separated from vehicles, how horses are close to deer but far from birds, and so on. Figure reproduced with permission from Socher, Ganjoo, Manning, and Ng (2013), “T-SNE visualization of the semantic word space.”

#### Semisupervised learning

Some algorithms can deal with partially labeled training data, usually a lot of unlabeled data and a little bit of labeled data. This is called semisupervised learning (Figure 1-11).

Some photo-hosting services, such as Google Photos, are good examples of this. Once you upload all your family photos to the service, it automatically recognizes that the same person A shows up in photos 1, 5, and 11, while another person B shows up in photos 2, 5, and 7. This is the unsupervised part of the algorithm (clustering). Now all the system needs is for you to tell it who these people are. Just one label per person, [4]  and it is able to name everyone in every photo, which is useful for searching photos.

Figure 1-11. Semisupervised learning 

Most semisupervised learning algorithms are combinations of unsupervised and supervised algorithms. For example, deep belief networks (DBNs) are based on unsupervised components called restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) stacked on top of one another. RBMs are trained sequentially in an unsupervised manner, and then the whole system is fine-tuned using supervised learning techniques.

4 That’s when the system works perfectly. In practice it often creates a few clusters per person, and sometimes mixes up two people who look alike, so you need to provide a few labels per person and manually clean up some clusters.

#### Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning is a very different beast. The learning system, called an agent in this context, can observe the environment, select and perform actions, and get rewards in return (or penalties in the form of negative rewards, as in Figure 1-12). It must then learn by itself what is the best strategy, called a policy, to get the most reward over time. A policy defines what action the agent should choose when it is in a given situation.

Figure 1-12. Reinforcement Learning

For example, many robots implement Reinforcement Learning algorithms to learn how to walk. DeepMind’s AlphaGo program is also a good example of Reinforcement Learning: it made the headlines in May 2017 when it beat the world champion Ke Jie at the game of Go. It learned its winning policy by analyzing millions of games, and then playing many games against itself. Note that learning was turned off during the games against the champion; AlphaGo was just applying the policy it had learned.

#### 1.3.2 Batch and Online Learning

Another criterion used to classify Machine Learning systems is whether or not the system can learn incrementally from a stream of incoming data.

1-3『跟间歇反应、连续反应关联上了，区别在于有没有连续进料，类比于连续进数据，妙哉。（2020-11-22）』

#### Batch learning

In batch learning, the system is incapable of learning incrementally: it must be trained using all the available data. This will generally take a lot of time and computing resources, so it is typically done offline. First the system is trained, and then it is launched into production and runs without learning anymore; it just applies what it has learned. This is called offline learning.

If you want a batch learning system to know about new data (such as a new type of spam), you need to train a new version of the system from scratch on the full dataset (not just the new data, but also the old data), then stop the old system and replace it with the new one.

Fortunately, the whole process of training, evaluating, and launching a Machine Learning system can be automated fairly easily (as shown in Figure 1-3), so even a batch learning system can adapt to change. Simply update the data and train a new version of the system from scratch as often as needed.

This solution is simple and often works fine, but training using the full set of data can take many hours, so you would typically train a new system only every 24 hours or even just weekly. If your system needs to adapt to rapidly changing data (e.g., to predict stock prices), then you need a more reactive solution.

Also, training on the full set of data requires a lot of computing resources (CPU, memory space, disk space, disk I/O, network I/O, etc.). If you have a lot of data and you automate your system to train from scratch every day, it will end up costing you a lot of money. If the amount of data is huge, it may even be impossible to use a batch learning algorithm.

Finally, if your system needs to be able to learn autonomously and it has limited resources (e.g., a smartphone application or a rover on Mars), then carrying around large amounts of training data and taking up a lot of resources to train for hours every day is a showstopper.

Fortunately, a better option in all these cases is to use algorithms that are capable of learning incrementally.

#### Online learning

In online learning, you train the system incrementally by feeding it data instances sequentially, either individually or by small groups called mini-batches. Each learning step is fast and cheap, so the system can learn about new data on the fly, as it arrives (see Figure 1-13).

Figure 1-13. Online learning

Online learning is great for systems that receive data as a continuous flow (e.g., stock prices) and need to adapt to change rapidly or autonomously. It is also a good option if you have limited computing resources: once an online learning system has learned about new data instances, it does not need them anymore, so you can discard them (unless you want to be able to roll back to a previous state and “replay” the data). This can save a huge amount of space.

Online learning algorithms can also be used to train systems on huge datasets that cannot fit in one machine’s main memory (this is called out-of-core learning). The algorithm loads part of the data, runs a training step on that data, and repeats the process until it has run on all of the data (see Figure 1-14).

Out-of-core learning is usually done offline (i.e., not on the live system), so online learning can be a confusing name. Think of it as incremental learning.

Figure 1-14. Using online learning to handle huge datasets

One important parameter of online learning systems is how fast they should adapt to changing data: this is called the learning rate. If you set a high learning rate, then your system will rapidly adapt to new data, but it will also tend to quickly forget the old data (you don’t want a spam filter to flag only the latest kinds of spam it was shown). Conversely, if you set a low learning rate, the system will have more inertia; that is, it will learn more slowly, but it will also be less sensitive to noise in the new data or to sequences of nonrepresentative data points (outliers).

A big challenge with online learning is that if bad data is fed to the system, the system’s performance will gradually decline. If we are talking about a live system, your clients will notice. For example, bad data could come from a malfunctioning sensor on a robot, or from someone spamming a search engine to try to rank high in search results. To reduce this risk, you need to monitor your system closely and promptly switch learning off (and possibly revert to a previously working state) if you detect a drop in performance. You may also want to monitor the input data and react to abnormal data (e.g., using an anomaly detection algorithm).

#### 1.3.3 Instance-Based Versus Model-Based Learning

One more way to categorize Machine Learning systems is by how they generalize. Most Machine Learning tasks are about making predictions. This means that given a number of training examples, the system needs to be able to generalize to examples it has never seen before. Having a good performance measure on the training data is good, but insufficient; the true goal is to perform well on new instances.

There are two main approaches to generalization: instance-based learning and model-based learning.

#### Instance-based learning

Possibly the most trivial form of learning is simply to learn by heart. If you were to create a spam filter this way, it would just flag all emails that are identical to emails that have already been flagged by users—not the worst solution, but certainly not the best.

Instead of just flagging emails that are identical to known spam emails, your spam filter could be programmed to also flag emails that are very similar to known spam emails. This requires a measure of similarity between two emails. A (very basic) similarity measure between two emails could be to count the number of words they have in common. The system would flag an email as spam if it has many words in common with a known spam email.

This is called instance-based learning: the system learns the examples by heart, then generalizes to new cases by comparing them to the learned examples (or a subset of them), using a similarity measure. For example, in Figure 1-15 the new instance would be classified as a triangle because the majority of the most similar instances belong to that class.

Figure 1-15. Instance-based learning

#### Model-based learning

Another way to generalize from a set of examples is to build a model of these examples, then use that model to make predictions. This is called model-based learning (Figure 1-16).

Figure 1-16. Model-based learning

For example, suppose you want to know if money makes people happy, so you download the Better Life Index data from the OECD’s website as well as stats about GDP per capita from the IMF’s website. Then you join the tables and sort by GDP per capita. Table 1-1 shows an excerpt of what you get.

Let’s plot the data for a few random countries (Figure 1-17).

Figure 1-17. Do you see a trend here?

There does seem to be a trend here! Although the data is noisy (i.e., partly random), it looks like life satisfaction goes up more or less linearly as the country’s GDP per capita increases. So you decide to model life satisfaction as a linear function of GDP per capita. This step is called model selection: you selected a linear model of life satisfaction with just one attribute, GDP per capita (Equation 1-1).

Equation 1-1. A simple linear model 

```
life_satisfaction = θ0 + θ1 × GDP_per_capita
```

This model has two model parameters, θ0 and θ1. [5] By tweaking these parameters, you can make your model represent any linear function, as shown in Figure 1-18.

Figure 1-18. A few possible linear models

Before you can use your model, you need to define the parameter values θ0 and θ1. How can you know which values will make your model perform best? To answer this question, you need to specify a performance measure. You can either define a utility function (or fitness function) that measures how good your model is, or you can define a cost function that measures how bad it is. For linear regression problems, people typically use a cost function that measures the distance between the linear model’s predictions and the training examples; the objective is to minimize this distance.

1『功效方程和成本方程这两个术语出来了，原来这两个函数都是用来衡量模型好坏的，第一次看到 cost function 是在吴恩达的 ML 课里。（2020-11-22）』

This is where the Linear Regression algorithm comes in: you feed it your training examples and it finds the parameters that make the linear model fit best to your data. This is called training the model. In our case the algorithm finds that the optimal parameter values are `θ0 = 4.85` and `θ1 = 4.91 × 10^–5`. Now the model fits the training data as closely as possible (for a linear model), as you can see in Figure 1-19.

You are finally ready to run the model to make predictions. For example, say you want to know how happy Cypriots are, and the OECD data does not have the answer. Fortunately, you can use your model to make a good prediction: you look up Cyprus’s GDP per capita, find `$22,587`, and then apply your model and find that life satisfaction is likely to be somewhere around `4.85 + 22,587 × 4.91 × 10^-5 = 5.96`.

To whet your appetite, Example 1-1 shows the Python code that loads the data, prepares it, [6] creates a scatterplot for visualization, and then trains a linear model and makes a prediction. [7]

If you had used an instance-based learning algorithm instead, you would have found that Slovenia has the closest GDP per capita to that of Cyprus (`$20,732`), and since the OECD data tells us that Slovenians’ life satisfaction is 5.7, you would have predicted a life satisfaction of 5.7 for Cyprus. If you zoom out a bit and look at the two next closest countries, you will find Portugal and Spain with life satisfactions of 5.1 and 6.5, respectively. Averaging these three values, you get 5.77, which is pretty close to your model-based prediction. This simple algorithm is called k-Nearest Neighbors regression (in this example, k = 3).

Replacing the Linear Regression model with k-Nearest Neighbors regression in the previous code is as simple as replacing these two lines:

```py
import sklearn.linear_model 
model = sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression()
```

with these two:

```py
import sklearn.neighbors
model = sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsRegressor(n_neighbors=3)
```

If all went well, your model will make good predictions. If not, you may need to use more attributes (employment rate, health, air pollution, etc.), get more or better quality training data, or perhaps select a more powerful model (e.g., a Polynomial Regression model).

In summary:

• You studied the data.

• You selected a model.

• You trained it on the training data (i.e., the learning algorithm searched for the model parameter values that minimize a cost function).

• Finally, you applied the model to make predictions on new cases (this is called inference), hoping that this model will generalize well.

This is what a typical Machine Learning project looks like. In Chapter 2 you will experience this first-hand by going through an end-to-end project.

We have covered a lot of ground so far: you now know what Machine Learning is really about, why it is useful, what some of the most common categories of ML systems are, and what a typical project workflow looks like. Now let’s look at what can go wrong in learning and prevent you from making accurate predictions.

5 By convention, the Greek letter θ (theta) is frequently used to represent model parameters.

6 The `prepare_country_stats()` function’s definition is not shown here (see this chapter’s Jupyter notebook if you want all the gory details). It’s just boring Pandas code that joins the life satisfaction data from the OECD with the GDP per capita data from the IMF.

7 It’s okay if you don’t understand all the code yet; we will present Scikit-Learn in the following chapters.

### 1.4 Main Challenges of Machine Learning

In short, since your main task is to select a learning algorithm and train it on some data, the two things that can go wrong are “bad algorithm” and “bad data.” Let’s start with examples of bad data.

#### 1.4.1 Insufficient Quantity of Training Data

For a toddler to learn what an apple is, all it takes is for you to point to an apple and say “apple” (possibly repeating this procedure a few times). Now the child is able to recognize apples in all sorts of colors and shapes. Genius.

Machine Learning is not quite there yet; it takes a lot of data for most Machine Learning algorithms to work properly. Even for very simple problems you typically need thousands of examples, and for complex problems such as image or speech recognition you may need millions of examples (unless you can reuse parts of an existing model).

#### The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data

In a famous paper published in 2001, Microsoft researchers Michele Banko and Eric Brill showed that very different Machine Learning algorithms, including fairly simple ones, performed almost identically well on a complex problem of natural language disambiguation [8] once they were given enough data (as you can see in Figure 1-20).

Figure 1-20. The importance of data versus algorithms [9] 

As the authors put it: “these results suggest that we may want to reconsider the tradeoff between spending time and money on algorithm development versus spending it on corpus development.”

The idea that data matters more than algorithms for complex problems was further popularized by Peter Norvig et al. in a paper titled “The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data” published in 2009. [10] It should be noted, however, that small- and medium-sized datasets are still very common, and it is not always easy or cheap to get extra training data, so don’t abandon algorithms just yet.

8 For example, knowing whether to write “to,” “two,” or “too” depending on the context.

#### 1.4.2 Nonrepresentative Training Data

In order to generalize well, it is crucial that your training data be representative of the new cases you want to generalize to. This is true whether you use instance-based learning or model-based learning.

For example, the set of countries we used earlier for training the linear model was not perfectly representative; a few countries were missing. Figure 1-21 shows what the data looks like when you add the missing countries.

Figure 1-21. A more representative training sample 

If you train a linear model on this data, you get the solid line, while the old model is represented by the dotted line. As you can see, not only does adding a few missing countries significantly alter the model, but it makes it clear that such a simple linear model is probably never going to work well. It seems that very rich countries are not happier than moderately rich countries (in fact they seem unhappier), and conversely some poor countries seem happier than many rich countries.

By using a nonrepresentative training set, we trained a model that is unlikely to make accurate predictions, especially for very poor and very rich countries.

It is crucial to use a training set that is representative of the cases you want to generalize to. This is often harder than it sounds: if the sample is too small, you will have sampling noise (i.e., nonrepresentative data as a result of chance), but even very large samples can be nonrepresentative if the sampling method is flawed. This is called sampling bias.

#### A Famous Example of Sampling Bias

Perhaps the most famous example of sampling bias happened during the US presidential election in 1936, which pitted Landon against Roosevelt: the Literary Digest conducted a very large poll, sending mail to about 10 million people. It got 2.4 million answers, and predicted with high confidence that Landon would get 57% of the votes.

Instead, Roosevelt won with 62% of the votes. The flaw was in the Literary Digest’s sampling method:

• First, to obtain the addresses to send the polls to, the Literary Digest used telephone directories, lists of magazine subscribers, club membership lists, and the like. All of these lists tend to favor wealthier people, who are more likely to vote Republican (hence Landon).

• Second, less than 25% of the people who received the poll answered. Again, this introduces a sampling bias, by ruling out people who don’t care much about politics, people who don’t like the Literary Digest, and other key groups. This is a special type of sampling bias called nonresponse bias.

Here is another example: say you want to build a system to recognize funk music videos. One way to build your training set is to search “funk music” on YouTube and use the resulting videos. But this assumes that YouTube’s search engine returns a set of videos that are representative of all the funk music videos on YouTube. In reality, the search results are likely to be biased toward popular artists (and if you live in Brazil you will get a lot of “funk carioca” videos, which sound nothing like James Brown). On the other hand, how else can you get a large training set?

#### 1.4.3 Poor-Quality Data

Obviously, if your training data is full of errors, outliers, and noise (e.g., due to poor-quality measurements), it will make it harder for the system to detect the underlying patterns, so your system is less likely to perform well. It is often well worth the effort to spend time cleaning up your training data. The truth is, most data scientists spend a significant part of their time doing just that. For example:

• If some instances are clearly outliers, it may help to simply discard them or try to fix the errors manually.

• If some instances are missing a few features (e.g., 5% of your customers did not specify their age), you must decide whether you want to ignore this attribute altogether, ignore these instances, fill in the missing values (e.g., with the median age), or train one model with the feature and one model without it, and so on.

#### 1.4.4 Irrelevant Features

As the saying goes: garbage in, garbage out. Your system will only be capable of learning if the training data contains enough relevant features and not too many irrelevant ones. A critical part of the success of a Machine Learning project is coming up with a good set of features to train on. This process, called feature engineering, involves:

• Feature selection: selecting the most useful features to train on among existing features.

• Feature extraction: combining existing features to produce a more useful one (as we saw earlier, dimensionality reduction algorithms can help).

• Creating new features by gathering new data.

Now that we have looked at many examples of bad data, let’s look at a couple of examples of bad algorithms.

#### 1.4.5 Overfitting the Training Data

Say you are visiting a foreign country and the taxi driver rips you off. You might be tempted to say that all taxi drivers in that country are thieves. Overgeneralizing is something that we humans do all too often, and unfortunately machines can fall into the same trap if we are not careful. In Machine Learning this is called overfitting: it means that the model performs well on the training data, but it does not generalize well.

Figure 1-22 shows an example of a high-degree polynomial life satisfaction model that strongly overfits the training data. Even though it performs much better on the training data than the simple linear model, would you really trust its predictions?

Figure 1-22. Overfitting the training data

Complex models such as deep neural networks can detect subtle patterns in the data, but if the training set is noisy, or if it is too small (which introduces sampling noise), then the model is likely to detect patterns in the noise itself. Obviously these patterns will not generalize to new instances. For example, say you feed your life satisfaction model many more attributes, including uninformative ones such as the country’s name. In that case, a complex model may detect patterns like the fact that all countries in the training data with a w in their name have a life satisfaction greater than 7: New Zealand (7.3), Norway (7.4), Sweden (7.2), and Switzerland (7.5). How confident are you that the W-satisfaction rule generalizes to Rwanda or Zimbabwe? Obviously this pattern occurred in the training data by pure chance, but the model has no way to tell whether a pattern is real or simply the result of noise in the data.

Overfitting happens when the model is too complex relative to the amount and noisiness of the training data. The possible solutions are:

• To simplify the model by selecting one with fewer parameters (e.g., a linear model rather than a high-degree polynomial model), by reducing the number of attributes in the training data or by constraining the model.

• To gather more training data.

• To reduce the noise in the training data (e.g., fix data errors and remove outliers).

Constraining a model to make it simpler and reduce the risk of overfitting is called regularization. For example, the linear model we defined earlier has two parameters, θ0 and θ1. This gives the learning algorithm two degrees of freedom to adapt the model to the training data: it can tweak both the height (θ0) and the slope (θ1) of the line. If we forced θ1 = 0, the algorithm would have only one degree of freedom and would have a much harder time fitting the data properly: all it could do is move the line up or down to get as close as possible to the training instances, so it would end up around the mean. A very simple model indeed! If we allow the algorithm to modify θ1  but we force it to keep it small, then the learning algorithm will effectively have somewhere in between one and two degrees of freedom. It will produce a simpler model than with two degrees of freedom, but more complex than with just one. You want to find the right balance between fitting the training data perfectly and keeping the model simple enough to ensure that it will generalize well.

Figure 1-23 shows three models: the dotted line represents the original model that was trained with a few countries missing, the dashed line is our second model trained with all countries, and the solid line is a linear model trained with the same data as the first model but with a regularization constraint. You can see that regularization forced the model to have a smaller slope, which fits a bit less the training data that the model was trained on, but actually allows it to generalize better to new examples.

Figure 1-23. Regularization reduces the risk of overfitting

The amount of regularization to apply during learning can be controlled by a hyperparameter. A hyperparameter is a parameter of a learning algorithm (not of the model). As such, it is not affected by the learning algorithm itself; it must be set prior to training and remains constant during training. If you set the regularization hyperparameter to a very large value, you will get an almost flat model (a slope close to zero); the learning algorithm will almost certainly not overfit the training data, but it will be less likely to find a good solution. Tuning hyperparameters is an important part of building a Machine Learning system (you will see a detailed example in the next chapter).

#### 1.4.6 Underfitting the Training Data

As you might guess, underfitting is the opposite of overfitting: it occurs when your model is too simple to learn the underlying structure of the data. For example, a linear model of life satisfaction is prone to underfit; reality is just more complex than the model, so its predictions are bound to be inaccurate, even on the training examples.

The main options to fix this problem are:

• Selecting a more powerful model, with more parameters

• Feeding better features to the learning algorithm (feature engineering)

• Reducing the constraints on the model (e.g., reducing the regularization hyperparameter)

#### 1.4.7 Stepping Back

By now you already know a lot about Machine Learning. However, we went through so many concepts that you may be feeling a little lost, so let’s step back and look at the big picture:

• Machine Learning is about making machines get better at some task by learning from data, instead of having to explicitly code rules.

• There are many different types of ML systems: supervised or not, batch or online, instance-based or model-based, and so on.

• In a ML project you gather data in a training set, and you feed the training set to a learning algorithm. If the algorithm is model-based it tunes some parameters to fit the model to the training set (i.e., to make good predictions on the training set itself), and then hopefully it will be able to make good predictions on new cases as well. If the algorithm is instance-based, it just learns the examples by heart and generalizes to new instances by comparing them to the learned instances using a similarity measure.

• The system will not perform well if your training set is too small, or if the data is not representative, noisy, or polluted with irrelevant features (garbage in, garbage out). Lastly, your model needs to be neither too simple (in which case it will underfit) nor too complex (in which case it will overfit).

There’s just one last important topic to cover: once you have trained a model, you don’t want to just “hope” it generalizes to new cases. You want to evaluate it, and finetune it if necessary. Let’s see how.

### 1.5 Testing and Validating

The only way to know how well a model will generalize to new cases is to actually try it out on new cases. One way to do that is to put your model in production and monitor how well it performs. This works well, but if your model is horribly bad, your users will complain—not the best idea.

A better option is to split your data into two sets: the training set and the test set. As these names imply, you train your model using the training set, and you test it using the test set. The error rate on new cases is called the generalization error (or out-of-sample error), and by evaluating your model on the test set, you get an estimate of this error. This value tells you how well your model will perform on instances it has never seen before.

If the training error is low (i.e., your model makes few mistakes on the training set) but the generalization error is high, it means that your model is overfitting the training data.

It is common to use 80% of the data for training and hold out 20% for testing. However, this depends on the size of the dataset: if it contains 10 million instances, then holding out 1% means your test set will contain 100,000 instances: that’s probably more than enough to get a good estimate of the generalization error.

#### 1.5.1 Hyperparameter Tuning and Model Selection

So evaluating a model is simple enough: just use a test set. Now suppose you are hesitating between two models (say a linear model and a polynomial model): how can you decide? One option is to train both and compare how well they generalize using the test set.

Now suppose that the linear model generalizes better, but you want to apply some regularization to avoid overfitting. The question is: how do you choose the value of the regularization hyperparameter? One option is to train 100 different models using 100 different values for this hyperparameter. Suppose you find the best hyperparameter value that produces a model with the lowest generalization error, say just 5% error.

So you launch this model into production, but unfortunately it does not perform as well as expected and produces 15% errors. What just happened?

The problem is that you measured the generalization error multiple times on the test set, and you adapted the model and hyperparameters to produce the best model for that particular set. This means that the model is unlikely to perform as well on new data.

A common solution to this problem is called holdout validation: you simply hold out part of the training set to evaluate several candidate models and select the best one. The new heldout set is called the validation set (or sometimes the development set, or dev set). More specifically, you train multiple models with various hyperparameters on the reduced training set (i.e., the full training set minus the validation set), and you select the model that performs best on the validation set. After this holdout validation process, you train the best model on the full training set (including the validation set), and this gives you the final model. Lastly, you evaluate this final model on the test set to get an estimate of the generalization error.

This solution usually works quite well. However, if the validation set is too small, then model evaluations will be imprecise: you may end up selecting a suboptimal model by mistake. Conversely, if the validation set is too large, then the remaining training set will be much smaller than the full training set. Why is this bad? Well, since the final model will be trained on the full training set, it is not ideal to compare candidate models trained on a much smaller training set. It would be like selecting the fastest sprinter to participate in a marathon. One way to solve this problem is to perform repeated cross-validation, using many small validation sets. Each model is evaluated once per validation set, after it is trained on the rest of the data. By averaging out all the evaluations of a model, we get a much more accurate measure of its performance. However, there is a drawback: the training time is multiplied by the number of validation sets.

#### 1.5.2 Data Mismatch

In some cases, it is easy to get a large amount of data for training, but it is not perfectly representative of the data that will be used in production. For example, suppose you want to create a mobile app to take pictures of flowers and automatically determine their species. You can easily download millions of pictures of flowers on the web, but they won’t be perfectly representative of the pictures that will actually be taken using the app on a mobile device. Perhaps you only have 10,000 representative pictures (i.e., actually taken with the app). In this case, the most important rule to remember is that the validation set and the test must be as representative as possible of the data you expect to use in production, so they should be composed exclusively of representative pictures: you can shuffle them and put half in the validation set, and half in the test set (making sure that no duplicates or near-duplicates end up in both sets). After training your model on the web pictures, if you observe that the performance of your model on the validation set is disappointing, you will not know whether this is because your model has overfit the training set, or whether this is just due to the mismatch between the web pictures and the mobile app pictures. 

One solution is to hold out part of the training pictures (from the web) in yet another set that Andrew Ng calls the train-dev set. After the model is trained (on the training set, not on the train-dev set), you can evaluate it on the train-dev set: if it performs well, then the model is not overfitting the training set, so if performs poorly on the validation set, the problem must come from the data mismatch. You can try to tackle this problem by preprocessing the web images to make them look more like the pictures that will be taken by the mobile app, and then retraining the model. 

Conversely, if the model performs poorly on the train-dev set, then the model must have overfit the training set, so you should try to simplify or regularize the model, get more training data and clean up the training data, as discussed earlier.

#### No Free Lunch Theorem

A model is a simplified version of the observations. The simplifications are meant to discard the superfluous details that are unlikely to generalize to new instances. However, to decide what data to discard and what data to keep, you must make assumptions. For example, a linear model makes the assumption that the data is fundamentally linear and that the distance between the instances and the straight line is just noise, which can safely be ignored.

In a famous 1996 paper, [11] David Wolpert demonstrated that if you make absolutely no assumption about the data, then there is no reason to prefer one model over any other. This is called the No Free Lunch (NFL) theorem. For some datasets the best model is a linear model, while for other datasets it is a neural network. There is no model that is a priori guaranteed to work better (hence the name of the theorem). The only way to know for sure which model is best is to evaluate them all. Since this is not possible, in practice you make some reasonable assumptions about the data and you evaluate only a few reasonable models. For example, for simple tasks you may evaluate linear models with various levels of regularization, and for a complex problem you may evaluate various neural networks.

### 2.1 Working with Real Data

When you are learning about Machine Learning it is best to actually experiment with real-world data, not just artificial datasets. Fortunately, there are thousands of open datasets to choose from, ranging across all sorts of domains. Here are a few places you can look to get data:

• Popular open data repositories:

— [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)

— [Find Open Datasets and Machine Learning Projects | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)

— [Registry of Open Data on AWS](https://registry.opendata.aws/)

• Meta portals (they list open data repositories):

— [- Data Portals](http://dataportals.org/)

— [OpenDataMonitor](https://opendatamonitor.eu/frontend/web/index.php?r=dashboard%2Findex)

— [Financial, Economic and Alternative Data | Quandl](https://www.quandl.com/)

• Other pages listing many popular open data repositories:

— Wikipedia’s list of Machine Learning datasets 

— Quora.com question 

— Datasets subreddit

In this chapter we chose the California Housing Prices dataset from the StatLib repository [2] (see Figure 2-1). This dataset was based on data from the 1990 California census. It is not exactly recent (you could still afford a nice house in the Bay Area at the time), but it has many qualities for learning, so we will pretend it is recent data. We also added a categorical attribute and removed a few features for teaching purposes.

Figure 2-1. California housing prices

2 The original dataset appeared in R. Kelley Pace and Ronald Barry, “Sparse Spatial Autoregressions,” Statistics & Probability Letters 33, no. 3 (1997): 291–297.

### 2.2 Look at the Big Picture

Welcome to Machine Learning Housing Corporation! The first task you are asked to perform is to build a model of housing prices in California using the California census data. This data has metrics such as the population, median income, median housing price, and so on for each block group in California. Block groups are the smallest geographical unit for which the US Census Bureau publishes sample data (a block group typically has a population of 600 to 3,000 people). We will just call them “districts” for short.

Your model should learn from this data and be able to predict the median housing price in any district, given all the other metrics.

Since you are a well-organized data scientist, the first thing you do is to pull out your Machine Learning project checklist. You can start with the one in ???; it should work reasonably well for most Machine Learning projects but make sure to adapt it to your needs. In this chapter we will go through many checklist items, but we will also skip a few, either because they are self-explanatory or because they will be discussed in later chapters.

#### 2.2.1 Frame the Problem

The first question to ask your boss is what exactly is the business objective; building a model is probably not the end goal. How does the company expect to use and benefit from this model? This is important because it will determine how you frame the problem, what algorithms you will select, what performance measure you will use to evaluate your model, and how much effort you should spend tweaking it.

Your boss answers that your model’s output (a prediction of a district’s median housing price) will be fed to another Machine Learning system (see Figure 2-2), along with many other signals. [3] This downstream system will determine whether it is worth investing in a given area or not. Getting this right is critical, as it directly affects revenue.

![](./res/2020025.png)

Figure 2-2. A Machine Learning pipeline for real estate investments

#### Pipelines

A sequence of data processing components is called a data pipeline. Pipelines are very common in Machine Learning systems, since there is a lot of data to manipulate and many data transformations to apply.

Components typically run asynchronously. Each component pulls in a large amount of data, processes it, and spits out the result in another data store, and then some time later the next component in the pipeline pulls this data and spits out its own output, and so on. Each component is fairly self-contained: the interface between components is simply the data store. This makes the system quite simple to grasp (with the help of a data flow graph), and different teams can focus on different components. Moreover, if a component breaks down, the downstream components can often continue to run normally (at least for a while) by just using the last output from the broken component. This makes the architecture quite robust.

On the other hand, a broken component can go unnoticed for some time if proper monitoring is not implemented. The data gets stale and the overall system’s performance drops.

The next question to ask is what the current solution looks like (if any). It will often give you a reference performance, as well as insights on how to solve the problem. Your boss answers that the district housing prices are currently estimated manually by experts: a team gathers up-to-date information about a district, and when they cannot get the median housing price, they estimate it using complex rules.

This is costly and time-consuming, and their estimates are not great; in cases where they manage to find out the actual median housing price, they often realize that their estimates were off by more than 20%. This is why the company thinks that it would be useful to train a model to predict a district’s median housing price given other data about that district. The census data looks like a great dataset to exploit for this purpose, since it includes the median housing prices of thousands of districts, as well as other data.

Okay, with all this information you are now ready to start designing your system. First, you need to frame the problem: is it supervised, unsupervised, or Reinforcement Learning? Is it a classification task, a regression task, or something else? Should you use batch learning or online learning techniques? Before you read on, pause and try to answer these questions for yourself.

Have you found the answers? Let’s see: it is clearly a typical supervised learning task since you are given labeled training examples (each instance comes with the expected output, i.e., the district’s median housing price). Moreover, it is also a typical regression task, since you are asked to predict a value. More specifically, this is a multiple regression problem since the system will use multiple features to make a prediction (it will use the district’s population, the median income, etc.). It is also a univariate regression problem since we are only trying to predict a single value for each district. If we were trying to predict multiple values per district, it would be a multivariate regression problem. Finally, there is no continuous flow of data coming in the system, there is no particular need to adjust to changing data rapidly, and the data is small enough to fit in memory, so plain batch learning should do just fine.

If the data was huge, you could either split your batch learning work across multiple servers (using the MapReduce technique), or you could use an online learning technique instead.

3 A piece of information fed to a Machine Learning system is often called a signal in reference to Shannon’s information theory: you want a high signal/noise ratio.

#### 2.2.2 Select a Performance Measure

Your next step is to select a performance measure. A typical performance measure for regression problems is the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). It gives an idea of how much error the system typically makes in its predictions, with a higher weight for large errors. Equation 2-1 shows the mathematical formula to compute the RMSE.

![](./res/2020026.png)

Equation 2-1. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)

#### Notations

This equation introduces several very common Machine Learning notations that we will use throughout this book:

• m is the number of instances in the dataset you are measuring the RMSE on.

— For example, if you are evaluating the RMSE on a validation set of 2,000 districts, then m = 2,000.

• x(i) is a vector of all the feature values (excluding the label) of the i th instance in the dataset, and y(i) is its label (the desired output value for that instance).

— For example, if the first district in the dataset is located at longitude –118.29°, latitude 33.91°, and it has 1,416 inhabitants with a median income of `$38,372`, and the median house value is `$156,400` (ignoring the other features for now), then:

• X is a matrix containing all the feature values (excluding labels) of all instances in the dataset. There is one row per instance and the i th row is equal to the transpose of x(i) , noted (x(i))^T. [4]

— For example, if the first district is as just described, then the matrix X looks like this:

• h is your system’s prediction function, also called a hypothesis. When your system is given an instance’s feature vector x(i), it outputs a predicted value `ŷ(i) = h(x(i))` for that instance (ŷ is pronounced “y-hat”).

— For example, if your system predicts that the median housing price in the first district is `$158,400`, then `ŷ(1) = h(x(1)) = 158,400`. The prediction error for this district is `ŷ(1) – y(1) = 2,000`.

• RMSE(X,h) is the cost function measured on the set of examples using your hypothesis h.

We use lowercase italic font for scalar values (such as m or y(i)) and function names (such as h), lowercase bold font for vectors (such as x(i)), and uppercase bold font for matrices (such as X).

4 Recall that the transpose operator flips a column vector into a row vector (and vice versa).

Even though the RMSE is generally the preferred performance measure for regression tasks, in some contexts you may prefer to use another function. For example, suppose that there are many outlier districts. In that case, you may consider using the Mean Absolute Error (also called the Average Absolute Deviation; see Equation 2-2):

Both the RMSE and the MAE are ways to measure the distance between two vectors: the vector of predictions and the vector of target values. Various distance measures, or norms, are possible:

• Computing the root of a sum of squares (RMSE) corresponds to the Euclidean norm: it is the notion of distance you are familiar with. It is also called the ℓ2  norm, noted XXXX.

• Computing the sum of absolutes (MAE) corresponds to the ℓ1 norm, noted XXXX. It is sometimes called the Manhattan norm because it measures the distance between two points in a city if you can only travel along orthogonal city blocks.

• More generally, the ℓk norm of a vector v containing n elements is defined as XXXX. ℓ0 just gives the number of non-zero elements in the vector, and ℓ∞ gives the maximum absolute value in the vector.

• The higher the norm index, the more it focuses on large values and neglects small ones. This is why the RMSE is more sensitive to outliers than the MAE. But when outliers are exponentially rare (like in a bell-shaped curve), the RMSE performs very well and is generally preferred.

#### 2.2.3 Check the Assumptions

Lastly, it is good practice to list and verify the assumptions that were made so far (by you or others); this can catch serious issues early on. For example, the district prices that your system outputs are going to be fed into a downstream Machine Learning system, and we assume that these prices are going to be used as such. But what if the downstream system actually converts the prices into categories (e.g., “cheap,” “medium,” or “expensive”) and then uses those categories instead of the prices themselves? In this case, getting the price perfectly right is not important at all; your system just needs to get the category right. If that’s so, then the problem should have been framed as a classification task, not a regression task. You don’t want to find this out after working on a regression system for months.

Fortunately, after talking with the team in charge of the downstream system, you are confident that they do indeed need the actual prices, not just categories. Great! You’re all set, the lights are green, and you can start coding now!

### 2.3 Get the Data

It’s time to get your hands dirty. Don’t hesitate to pick up your laptop and walk through the following code examples in a Jupyter notebook. The full Jupyter notebook is available at https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2.

#### 2.3.1 Create the Workspace

First you will need to have Python installed. It is probably already installed on your system. If not, you can get it at https://www.python.org/. [5]

Next you need to create a workspace directory for your Machine Learning code and datasets. Open a terminal and type the following commands (after the `$ prompts`):

```py
$ export ML_PATH="$HOME/ml"    # You can change the path if you prefer

$ mkdir -p $ML_PATH
```

You will need a number of Python modules: Jupyter, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn. If you already have Jupyter running with all these modules installed, you can safely skip to “Download the Data” on page 49. If you don’t have them yet, there are many ways to install them (and their dependencies). You can use your system’s packaging system (e.g., apt-get on Ubuntu, or MacPorts or HomeBrew on MacOS), install a Scientific Python distribution such as Anaconda and use its packaging system, or just use Python’s own packaging system, pip, which is included by default with the Python binary installers (since Python 2.7.9). [6] You can check to see if pip is installed by typing the following command:

```
$ python3 -m pip --version 
pip 19.0.2 from 
[...]
/lib/python3.6/site-packages (python 3.6)
```

You should make sure you have a recent version of pip installed. To upgrade the pip module, type: [7] 

```
$ python3 -m pip install --user -U pip 
Collecting pip 
[...] 
Successfully installed pip-19.0.2
```

#### Creating an Isolated Environment

If you would like to work in an isolated environment (which is strongly recommended so you can work on different projects without having conflicting library versions), install virtualenv [8] by running the following pip command (again, if you want virtualenv to be installed for all users on your machine, remove --user and run this command with administrator rights):

```
$ python3 -m pip install --user -U virtualenv 
Collecting virtualenv 
[...] 
Successfully installed virtualenv
```

Now you can create an isolated Python environment by typing:

```
$ cd $ML_PATH 
$ virtualenv env 
Using base prefix '[...]' 
New python executable in [...]/ml/env/bin/python3.6 
Also creating executable in [...]/ml/env/bin/python 
Installing setuptools, pip, wheel...done.
```

Now every time you want to activate this environment, just open a terminal and type:

```
$ cd $ML_PATH 
$ source env/bin/activate # on Linux or MacOSX 
$ .\env\Scripts\activate # on Windows
```

To deactivate this environment, just type deactivate. While the environment is active, any package you install using pip will be installed in this isolated environment, and Python will only have access to these packages (if you also want access to the system’s packages, you should create the environment using virtualenv’s --system-sitepackages option). Check out virtualenv’s documentation for more information.

Now you can install all the required modules and their dependencies using this simple pip command (if you are not using a virtualenv, you will need the --user option or administrator rights):

```
$ python3 -m pip install -U jupyter matplotlib numpy pandas scipy scikit-learn 
Collecting jupyter
Downloading jupyter-1.0.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl 
Collecting matplotlib
[...]
```

To check your installation, try to import every module like this:

```
$ python3 -c "import jupyter, matplotlib, numpy, pandas, scipy, sklearn"
```

There should be no output and no error. Now you can fire up Jupyter by typing:

```
$ jupyter notebook 
[I 15:24 NotebookApp] Serving notebooks from local directory: [...]/ml 
[I 15:24 NotebookApp] 0 active kernels 
[I 15:24 NotebookApp] The Jupyter Notebook is running at: http://localhost:8888/ 
[I 15:24 NotebookApp] Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down all kernels (twice to skip confirmation).
```

A Jupyter server is now running in your terminal, listening to port 8888. You can visit this server by opening your web browser to http://localhost:8888/ (this usually happens automatically when the server starts). You should see your empty workspace directory (containing only the env directory if you followed the preceding virtualenv instructions).

Now create a new Python notebook by clicking on the New button and selecting the appropriate Python version [9] (see Figure 2-3). This does three things: first, it creates a new notebook file called Untitled.ipynb in your workspace; second, it starts a Jupyter Python kernel to run this notebook; and third, it opens this notebook in a new tab. You should start by renaming this notebook to “Housing” (this will automatically rename the file to Housing.ipynb) by clicking Untitled and typing the new name.

Figure 2-3. Your workspace in Jupyter

A notebook contains a list of cells. Each cell can contain executable code or formatted text. Right now the notebook contains only one empty code cell, labeled “In [1]:”. Try typing print("Hello world!") in the cell, and click on the play button (see Figure 2-4) or press Shift-Enter. This sends the current cell to this notebook’s Python kernel, which runs it and returns the output. The result is displayed below the cell, and since we reached the end of the notebook, a new cell is automatically created. Go through the User Interface Tour from Jupyter’s Help menu to learn the basics.

5 The latest version of Python 3 is recommended. Python 2.7+ may work too, but it is now deprecated, all major scientific libraries are dropping support for it, so you should migrate to Python 3 as soon as possible.

6 We will show the installation steps using pip in a bash shell on a Linux or MacOS system. You may need to adapt these commands to your own system. On Windows, we recommend installing Anaconda instead.

7 If you want to upgrade pip for all users on your machine rather than just your own user, you should remove the --user option and make sure you have administrator rights (e.g., by adding sudo before the whole command on Linux or MacOSX).

8 Alternative tools include venv (very similar to virtualenv and included in the standard library), virtualenvwrapper (provides extra functionalities on top of virtualenv), pyenv (allows easy switching between Python versions), and pipenv (a great packaging tool by the same author as the popular requests library, built on top of pip, virtualenv and more).

9 Note that Jupyter can handle multiple versions of Python, and even many other languages such as R or Octave.

#### 2.3.2 Download the Data

In typical environments your data would be available in a relational database (or some other common datastore) and spread across multiple tables/documents/files. To access it, you would first need to get your credentials and access authorizations, [10] and familiarize yourself with the data schema. In this project, however, things are much simpler: you will just download a single compressed file, housing.tgz, which contains a comma-separated value (CSV) file called housing.csv with all the data.

You could use your web browser to download it, and run tar xzf housing.tgz to decompress the file and extract the CSV file, but it is preferable to create a small function to do that. It is useful in particular if data changes regularly, as it allows you to write a small script that you can run whenever you need to fetch the latest data (or you can set up a scheduled job to do that automatically at regular intervals). Automating the process of fetching the data is also useful if you need to install the dataset on multiple machines.

Here is the function to fetch the data: [11] 

```py
import os, time 
import tarfile 
from six.moves import urllib

DOWNLOAD_ROOT = "https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2/master/" 
HOUSING_PATH = os.path.join("datasets", "housing")
HOUSING_URL = DOWNLOAD_ROOT + "datasets/housing/housing.tgz"

def fetch_housing_data(housing_url=HOUSING_URL, housing_path=HOUSING_PATH):
    if not os.path.isdir(housing_path):
        os.makedirs(housing_path) 
    tgz_path = os.path.join(housing_path, "housing.tgz") 
    urllib.request.urlretrieve(housing_url, tgz_path) 
    housing_tgz = tarfile.open(tgz_path) 
    housing_tgz.extractall(path=housing_path) 
    housing_tgz.close()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    time1=time.time()
    fetch_housing_data()
    time2 = time.time()
    print('OK!')
    print('Time Used: ' + str(time2 - time1) + 's')
```

1『目前没下载下来，发现 url 无效了，换了作者 GitHub 可访问的仓库 url 后还是没解决。索性直接从仓库文件里拷到自己的项目仓库里。（2020-11-23）』

Now when you call `fetch_housing_data()`, it creates a datasets/housing directory in your workspace, downloads the housing.tgz file, and extracts the housing.csv from it in this directory. Now let’s load the data using Pandas. Once again you should write a small function to load the data:

```
import pandas as pd 

def load_housing_data(housing_path=HOUSING_PATH):
    csv_path = os.path.join(housing_path, "housing.csv") 
    return pd.read_csv(csv_path)

# my code
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('./datasets/housing/housing.csv')
df.head()
df.info()
df.describe()
```

This function returns a Pandas DataFrame object containing all the data.

10 You might also need to check legal constraints, such as private fields that should never be copied to unsafe datastores.

11 In a real project you would save this code in a Python file, but for now you can just write it in your Jupyter notebook.

#### 2.3.3 Take a Quick Look at the Data Structure

Let’s take a look at the top five rows using the DataFrame’s `head() `method (see Figure 2-5).

Figure 2-5. Top five rows in the dataset

Each row represents one district. There are 10 attributes (you can see the first 6 in the screenshot): longitude, latitude, `housing_median_age`, `total_rooms`, `total_bedrooms`, population, households, `median_income`, `median_house_value`, and `ocean_proximity`. The `info()` method is useful to get a quick description of the data, in particular the total number of rows, and each attribute’s type and number of non-null values (see Figure 2-6).

Figure 2-6. Housing info

There are 20,640 instances in the dataset, which means that it is fairly small by Machine Learning standards, but it’s perfect to get started. Notice that the `total_bedrooms` attribute has only 20,433 non-null values, meaning that 207 districts are missing this feature. We will need to take care of this later.

All attributes are numerical, except the `ocean_proximity` field. Its type is object, so it could hold any kind of Python object, but since you loaded this data from a CSV file you know that it must be a text attribute. When you looked at the top five rows, you probably noticed that the values in the `ocean_proximity` column were repetitive, which means that it is probably a categorical attribute. You can find out what categories exist and how many districts belong to each category by using the `value_counts()` method:

```
>>> housing["ocean_proximity"].value_counts() 
<1H OCEAN 9136 
INLAND 6551 
NEAR OCEAN 2658 
NEAR BAY 2290 
ISLAND 5 
Name: ocean_proximity, dtype: int64
```

Let’s look at the other fields. The `describe()` method shows a summary of the numerical attributes (Figure 2-7).

Figure 2-7. Summary of each numerical attribute

The count, mean, min, and max rows are self-explanatory. Note that the null values are ignored (so, for example, count of `total_bedrooms` is 20,433, not 20,640). The std row shows the standard deviation, which measures how dispersed the values are.[12]  The 25%, 50%, and 75% rows show the corresponding percentiles: a percentile indicates the value below which a given percentage of observations in a group of observations falls. For example, 25% of the districts have a `housing_median_age` lower than 18, while 50% are lower than 29 and 75% are lower than 37. These are often called the 25 th percentile (or 1 st quartile), the median, and the 75 th percentile (or 3 rd quartile).

1『这几个函数真的好实用，愈发觉得 pandas 的好用了，真方便。（2020-11-23）』

Another quick way to get a feel of the type of data you are dealing with is to plot a histogram for each numerical attribute. A histogram shows the number of instances (on the vertical axis) that have a given value range (on the horizontal axis). You can either plot this one attribute at a time, or you can call the `hist()` method on the whole dataset, and it will plot a histogram for each numerical attribute (see Figure 2-8). For example, you can see that slightly over 800 districts have a `median_house_value` equal to about `$100,000`.

```py
%matplotlib inline # only in a Jupyter notebook 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
housing.hist(bins=50, figsize=(20,15))
plt.show()

# my code
%matplotlib inline
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
df.hist(bins=50, figsize=(20, 15))
plt.show()
```

1-3『

`%matplotlib `is a magic function in IPython. I'll quote the relevant documentation here for you to read for convenience:

IPython has a set of predefined ‘magic functions’ that you can call with a command line style syntax. There are two kinds of magics, line-oriented and cell-oriented. Line magics are prefixed with the `%` character and work much like OS command-line calls: they get as an argument the rest of the line, where arguments are passed without parentheses or quotes. Lines magics can return results and can be used in the right hand side of an assignment. Cell magics are prefixed with a double `%%`, and they are functions that get as an argument not only the rest of the line, but also the lines below it in a separate argument.

`%matplotlib inline` sets the backend of matplotlib to the 'inline' backend: With this backend, the output of plotting commands is displayed inline within frontends like the Jupyter notebook, directly below the code cell that produced it. The resulting plots will then also be stored in the notebook document.

When using the 'inline' backend, your matplotlib graphs will be included in your notebook, next to the code. It may be worth also reading How to make IPython notebook matplotlib plot inline for reference on how to use it in your code.

意思应该是，用了这个命令后，matplotlib 画出来的图是直接嵌在 jupyter notebook 里的，不用的话就跟之前自己做练习时弹出弹出来，这么看的话，这个设置应该成为自己的标配。回复：下面一段话，作者也解释了 `%matplotlib inline` 的作用，跟自己找到的信息吻合。（2020-11-23）

』

The `hist()` method relies on Matplotlib, which in turn relies on a user-specified graphical backend to draw on your screen. So before you can plot anything, you need to specify which backend Matplotlib should use. The simplest option is to use Jupyter’s magic command `%matplotlib inline`. This tells Jupyter to set up Matplotlib so it uses Jupyter’s own backend. Plots are then rendered within the notebook itself. Note that calling `show()` is optional in a Jupyter notebook, as Jupyter will automatically display plots when a cell is executed.

Figure 2-8. A histogram for each numerical attribute

Notice a few things in these histograms:

1 First, the median income attribute does not look like it is expressed in US dollars (USD). After checking with the team that collected the data, you are told that the data has been scaled and capped at 15 (actually 15.0001) for higher median incomes, and at 0.5 (actually 0.4999) for lower median incomes. The numbers represent roughly tens of thousands of dollars (e.g., 3 actually means about `$30,000`). Working with preprocessed attributes is common in Machine Learning, and it is not necessarily a problem, but you should try to understand how the data was computed.

2 The housing median age and the median house value were also capped. The latter may be a serious problem since it is your target attribute (your labels). Your Machine Learning algorithms may learn that prices never go beyond that limit. You need to check with your client team (the team that will use your system’s output) to see if this is a problem or not. If they tell you that they need precise predictions even beyond `$500,000`, then you have mainly two options:

a. Collect proper labels for the districts whose labels were capped.

b. Remove those districts from the training set (and also from the test set, since your system should not be evaluated poorly if it predicts values beyond `$500,000`).

3 These attributes have very different scales. We will discuss this later in this chapter when we explore feature scaling.

4 Finally, many histograms are tail heavy: they extend much farther to the right of the median than to the left. This may make it a bit harder for some Machine Learning algorithms to detect patterns. We will try transforming these attributes later on to have more bell-shaped distributions.

Hopefully you now have a better understanding of the kind of data you are dealing with. Wait! Before you look at the data any further, you need to create a test set, put it aside, and never look at it.

12 The standard deviation is generally denoted σ (the Greek letter sigma), and it is the square root of the variance, which is the average of the squared deviation from the mean. When a feature has a bell-shaped normal distribution (also called a Gaussian distribution), which is very common, the “68-95-99.7” rule applies: about 68% of the values fall within 1σ of the mean, 95% within 2σ, and 99.7% within 3σ.

#### 2.3.4 Create a Test Set

It may sound strange to voluntarily set aside part of the data at this stage. After all, you have only taken a quick glance at the data, and surely you should learn a whole lot more about it before you decide what algorithms to use, right? This is true, but your brain is an amazing pattern detection system, which means that it is highly prone to overfitting: if you look at the test set, you may stumble upon some seemingly interesting pattern in the test data that leads you to select a particular kind of Machine Learning model. When you estimate the generalization error using the test set, your estimate will be too optimistic and you will launch a system that will not perform as well as expected. This is called data snooping bias.

Creating a test set is theoretically quite simple: just pick some instances randomly, typically 20% of the dataset (or less if your dataset is very large), and set them aside:

``` py
import numpy as np 

def split_train_test(data, test_ratio):
    shuffled_indices = np.random.permutation(len(data)) 
    test_set_size = int(len(data) * test_ratio)
    test_indices = shuffled_indices[:test_set_size]
    train_indices = shuffled_indices[test_set_size:]
    return data.iloc[train_indices], data.iloc[test_indices]
```

You can then use this function like this:13 

```py
>>> train_set, test_set = split_train_test(housing, 0.2)
>>> len(train_set) 
16512
>>> len(test_set) 
4128
```

1『这个好的，上面的函数用来把源数据，随机分割成训练数据集（80%）和测试数据集（20%）。回复：下面几段信息介绍了更好的分割方案。（2020-11-23）』

Well, this works, but it is not perfect: if you run the program again, it will generate a different test set! Over time, you (or your Machine Learning algorithms) will get to see the whole dataset, which is what you want to avoid.

One solution is to save the test set on the first run and then load it in subsequent runs. Another option is to set the random number generator’s seed (e.g., `np.random.seed(42)`) [14] before calling `np.random.permutation()`, so that it always generates the same shuffled indices.

But both these solutions will break next time you fetch an updated dataset. A common solution is to use each instance’s identifier to decide whether or not it should go in the test set (assuming instances have a unique and immutable identifier). For example, you could compute a hash of each instance’s identifier and put that instance in the test set if the hash is lower or equal to 20% of the maximum hash value. This ensures that the test set will remain consistent across multiple runs, even if you refresh the dataset. The new test set will contain 20% of the new instances, but it will not contain any instance that was previously in the training set. Here is a possible implementation:

```py
from zlib import crc32 

def test_set_check(identifier, test_ratio):
    return crc32(np.int64(identifier)) & 0xffffffff < test_ratio * 2**32

def split_train_test_by_id(data, test_ratio, id_column):
    ids = data[id_column]
    in_test_set = ids.apply(lambda id_: test_set_check(id_, test_ratio)) 
    return data.loc[~in_test_set], data.loc[in_test_set]
```

Unfortunately, the housing dataset does not have an identifier column. The simplest solution is to use the row index as the ID:

```py
housing_with_id = housing.reset_index() # adds an `index` column 
train_set, test_set = split_train_test_by_id(housing_with_id, 0.2, "index")
```

If you use the row index as a unique identifier, you need to make sure that new data gets appended to the end of the dataset, and no row ever gets deleted. If this is not possible, then you can try to use the most stable features to build a unique identifier. For example, a district’s latitude and longitude are guaranteed to be stable for a few million years, so you could combine them into an ID like so: [15] 

```py
housing_with_id["id"] = housing["longitude"] * 1000 + housing["latitude"]
train_set, test_set = split_train_test_by_id(housing_with_id, 0.2, "id")
```

Scikit-Learn provides a few functions to split datasets into multiple subsets in various ways. The simplest function is `train_test_split`, which does pretty much the same thing as the function `split_train_test` defined earlier, with a couple of additional features. First there is a `random_state` parameter that allows you to set the random generator seed as explained previously, and second you can pass it multiple datasets with an identical number of rows, and it will split them on the same indices (this is very useful, for example, if you have a separate DataFrame for labels):

```
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
train_set, test_set = train_test_split(housing, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

So far we have considered purely random sampling methods. This is generally fine if your dataset is large enough (especially relative to the number of attributes), but if it is not, you run the risk of introducing a significant sampling bias. When a survey company decides to call 1,000 people to ask them a few questions, they don’t just pick 1,000 people randomly in a phone book. They try to ensure that these 1,000 people are representative of the whole population. For example, the US population is composed of 51.3% female and 48.7% male, so a well-conducted survey in the US would try to maintain this ratio in the sample: 513 female and 487 male. This is called stratified sampling: the population is divided into homogeneous subgroups called strata, and the right number of instances is sampled from each stratum to guarantee that the test set is representative of the overall population. If they used purely random sampling, there would be about 12% chance of sampling a skewed test set with either less than 49% female or more than 54% female. Either way, the survey results would be significantly biased.

Suppose you chatted with experts who told you that the median income is a very important attribute to predict median housing prices. You may want to ensure that the test set is representative of the various categories of incomes in the whole dataset. Since the median income is a continuous numerical attribute, you first need to create an income category attribute. Let’s look at the median income histogram more closely (back in Figure 2-8): 

most median income values are clustered around 1.5 to 6 (i.e., `$15,000`–`$60,000`), but some median incomes go far beyond 6. It is important to have a sufficient number of instances in your dataset for each stratum, or else the estimate of the stratum’s importance may be biased. This means that you should not have too many strata, and each stratum should be large enough. The following code uses the `pd.cut()` function to create an income category attribute with 5 categories (labeled from 1 to 5): category 1 ranges from 0 to 1.5 (i.e., less than `$15,000`), category 2 from 1.5 to 3, and so on:

```py
housing["income_cat"] = pd.cut(housing["median_income"], 
                                bins=[0., 1.5, 3.0, 4.5, 6., np.inf], 
                                labels=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
```

These income categories are represented in Figure 2-9:

```py
housing["income_cat"].hist()
```

Figure 2-9. Histogram of income categories

Now you are ready to do stratified sampling based on the income category. For this you can use Scikit-Learn’s StratifiedShuffleSplit class:

```py
from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedShuffleSplit

split = StratifiedShuffleSplit(n_splits=1, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
for train_index, test_index in split.split(housing, housing["income_cat"]):
    strat_train_set = housing.loc[train_index]
    strat_test_set = housing.loc[test_index]
```

Let’s see if this worked as expected. You can start by looking at the income category proportions in the test set:

```py
>>> strat_test_set["income_cat"].value_counts() / len(strat_test_set) 
3 0.350533 
2 0.318798 
4 0.176357 
5 0.114583 
1 0.039729 
Name: income_cat, dtype: float64
```

With similar code you can measure the income category proportions in the full dataset. Figure 2-10 compares the income category proportions in the overall dataset, in the test set generated with stratified sampling, and in a test set generated using purely random sampling. As you can see, the test set generated using stratified sampling has income category proportions almost identical to those in the full dataset, whereas the test set generated using purely random sampling is quite skewed.

Figure 2-10. Sampling bias comparison of stratified versus purely random sampling

Now you should remove the `income_cat` attribute so the data is back to its original state:

```py
for set_ in (strat_train_set, strat_test_set):
    set_.drop("income_cat", axis=1, inplace=True)
```

We spent quite a bit of time on test set generation for a good reason: this is an often neglected but critical part of a Machine Learning project. Moreover, many of these ideas will be useful later when we discuss cross-validation. Now it’s time to move on to the next stage: exploring the data.

13 In this book, when a code example contains a mix of code and outputs, as is the case here, it is formatted like in the Python interpreter, for better readability: the code lines are prefixed with `>>>` (or ... for indented blocks), and the outputs have no prefix.

14 You will often see people set the random seed to 42. This number has no special property, other than to be The Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything.

15 The location information is actually quite coarse, and as a result many districts will have the exact same ID, so they will end up in the same set (test or train). This introduces some unfortunate sampling bias.

### 2.4 Discover and Visualize the Data to Gain Insights

So far you have only taken a quick glance at the data to get a general understanding of the kind of data you are manipulating. Now the goal is to go a little bit more in depth.

First, make sure you have put the test set aside and you are only exploring the training set. Also, if the training set is very large, you may want to sample an exploration set, to make manipulations easy and fast. In our case, the set is quite small so you can just work directly on the full set. Let’s create a copy so you can play with it without harming the training set:

```py
housing = strat_train_set.copy()
```

#### 2.4.1 Visualizing Geographical Data

Since there is geographical information (latitude and longitude), it is a good idea to create a scatterplot of all districts to visualize the data (Figure 2-11):

```py
housing.plot(kind="scatter", x="longitude", y="latitude")
```

Figure 2-11. A geographical scatterplot of the data

This looks like California all right, but other than that it is hard to see any particular pattern. Setting the alpha option to 0.1 makes it much easier to visualize the places where there is a high density of data points (Figure 2-12):

```py
housing.plot(kind="scatter", x="longitude", y="latitude", alpha=0.1)
```

Figure 2-12. A better visualization highlighting high-density areas

Now that’s much better: you can clearly see the high-density areas, namely the Bay Area and around Los Angeles and San Diego, plus a long line of fairly high density in the Central Valley, in particular around Sacramento and Fresno. More generally, our brains are very good at spotting patterns on pictures, but you may need to play around with visualization parameters to make the patterns stand out.

Now let’s look at the housing prices (Figure 2-13). The radius of each circle represents the district’s population (option s), and the color represents the price (option c). We will use a predefined color map (option cmap) called jet, which ranges from blue (low values) to red (high prices): [16] 

```py
housing.plot(kind="scatter", x="longitude", y="latitude", alpha=0.4, 
            s=housing["population"]/100, label="population", figsize=(10,7), 
            c="median_house_value", cmap=plt.get_cmap("jet"), colorbar=True,) 
plt.legend()
```

Figure 2-13. California housing prices

Discover and Visualize the Data to Gain Insights

This image tells you that the housing prices are very much related to the location (e.g., close to the ocean) and to the population density, as you probably knew already. It will probably be useful to use a clustering algorithm to detect the main clusters, and add new features that measure the proximity to the cluster centers. The ocean proximity attribute may be useful as well, although in Northern California the housing prices in coastal districts are not too high, so it is not a simple rule.

16 If you are reading this in grayscale, grab a red pen and scribble over most of the coastline from the Bay Area down to San Diego (as you might expect). You can add a patch of yellow around Sacramento as well.

#### 2.4.2 Looking for Correlations

Since the dataset is not too large, you can easily compute the standard correlation coefficient (also called Pearson’s r) between every pair of attributes using the `corr()` method:

```py
corr_matrix = housing.corr()
```

Now let’s look at how much each attribute correlates with the median house value:

```py
>>> corr_matrix["median_house_value"].sort_values(ascending=False)
median_house_value 1.000000 
median_income 0.687170 
total_rooms 0.135231 
housing_median_age 0.114220 
households 0.064702 
total_bedrooms 0.047865 
population -0.026699 
longitude -0.047279 
latitude -0.142826 
Name: median_house_value, dtype: float64
```

1『 `corr_matrix` 这个函数好强大，可以以一个属性为基准点，直接算出其他属性与其的相关性。（2020-11-24）』

The correlation coefficient ranges from –1 to 1. When it is close to 1, it means that there is a strong positive correlation; for example, the median house value tends to go up when the median income goes up. When the coefficient is close to –1, it means that there is a strong negative correlation; you can see a small negative correlation between the latitude and the median house value (i.e., prices have a slight tendency to go down when you go north). Finally, coefficients close to zero mean that there is no linear correlation. Figure 2-14 shows various plots along with the correlation coefficient between their horizontal and vertical axes.

Figure 2-14. Standard correlation coefficient of various datasets (source: Wikipedia; public domain image)

The correlation coefficient only measures linear correlations (“if x goes up, then y generally goes up/down”). It may completely miss out on nonlinear relationships (e.g., “if x is close to zero then y generally goes up”). Note how all the plots of the bottom row have a correlation coefficient equal to zero despite the fact that their axes are clearly not independent: these are examples of nonlinear relationships. Also, the second row shows examples where the correlation coefficient is equal to 1 or –1; notice that this has nothing to do with the slope. For example, your height in inches has a correlation coefficient of 1 with your height in feet or in nanometers.

Another way to check for correlation between attributes is to use Pandas’ `scatter_matrix` function, which plots every numerical attribute against every other numerical attribute. Since there are now 11 numerical attributes, you would get 11^2 = 121 plots, which would not fit on a page, so let’s just focus on a few promising attributes that seem most correlated with the median housing value (Figure 2-15):

```py
from pandas.plotting import scatter_matrix

attributes = ["median_house_value", "median_income", "total_rooms", "housing_median_age"]
scatter_matrix(housing[attributes], figsize=(12, 8))
```

Figure 2-15. Scatter matrix

The main diagonal (top left to bottom right) would be full of straight lines if Pandas plotted each variable against itself, which would not be very useful. So instead Pandas displays a histogram of each attribute (other options are available; see Pandas’ documentation for more details).

The most promising attribute to predict the median house value is the median income, so let’s zoom in on their correlation scatterplot (Figure 2-16):

```py
housing.plot(kind="scatter", x="median_income", y="median_house_value", alpha=0.1)
```

This plot reveals a few things. First, the correlation is indeed very strong; you can clearly see the upward trend and the points are not too dispersed. Second, the price cap that we noticed earlier is clearly visible as a horizontal line at `$500,000`. But this plot reveals other less obvious straight lines: a horizontal line around `$450,000`, another around `$350,000`, perhaps one around `$280,000`, and a few more below that. You may want to try removing the corresponding districts to prevent your algorithms from learning to reproduce these data quirks.

Figure 2-16. Median income versus median house value

#### 2.4.3 Experimenting with Attribute Combinations

Hopefully the previous sections gave you an idea of a few ways you can explore the data and gain insights. You identified a few data quirks that you may want to clean up before feeding the data to a Machine Learning algorithm, and you found interesting correlations between attributes, in particular with the target attribute. You also noticed that some attributes have a tail-heavy distribution, so you may want to transform them (e.g., by computing their logarithm). Of course, your mileage will vary considerably with each project, but the general ideas are similar.

One last thing you may want to do before actually preparing the data for Machine Learning algorithms is to try out various attribute combinations. For example, the total number of rooms in a district is not very useful if you don’t know how many households there are. What you really want is the number of rooms per household. Similarly, the total number of bedrooms by itself is not very useful: you probably want to compare it to the number of rooms. And the population per household also seems like an interesting attribute combination to look at. Let’s create these new attributes:

```py
housing["rooms_per_household"] = housing["total_rooms"]/housing["households"]
housing["bedrooms_per_room"] = housing["total_bedrooms"]/housing["total_rooms"]
housing["population_per_household"]=housing["population"]/housing["households"]
```

And now let’s look at the correlation matrix again:

```py
>>> corr_matrix = housing.corr() 
>>> corr_matrix["median_house_value"].sort_values(ascending=False)
median_house_value 1.000000
median_income 0.687160 
rooms_per_household 0.146285 
total_rooms 0.135097 
housing_median_age 0.114110 
households 0.064506 
total_bedrooms 0.047689 
population_per_household -0.021985 
population -0.026920 
longitude -0.047432 
latitude -0.142724 
bedrooms_per_room -0.259984 
Name: median_house_value, dtype: float64
```

Hey, not bad! The new `bedrooms_per_room` attribute is much more correlated with the median house value than the total number of rooms or bedrooms. Apparently houses with a lower bedroom/room ratio tend to be more expensive. The number of rooms per household is also more informative than the total number of rooms in a district — obviously the larger the houses, the more expensive they are.

This round of exploration does not have to be absolutely thorough; the point is to start off on the right foot and quickly gain insights that will help you get a first reasonably good prototype. But this is an iterative process: once you get a prototype up and running, you can analyze its output to gain more insights and come back to this exploration step.

### 2.5 Prepare the Data for Machine Learning Algorithms

It’s time to prepare the data for your Machine Learning algorithms. Instead of just doing this manually, you should write functions to do that, for several good reasons:

• This will allow you to reproduce these transformations easily on any dataset (e.g., the next time you get a fresh dataset).

• You will gradually build a library of transformation functions that you can reuse in future projects.

• You can use these functions in your live system to transform the new data before feeding it to your algorithms.

• This will make it possible for you to easily try various transformations and see which combination of transformations works best.

But first let’s revert to a clean training set (by copying `strat_train_set` once again), and let’s separate the predictors and the labels since we don’t necessarily want to apply the same transformations to the predictors and the target values (note that `drop()` creates a copy of the data and does not affect `strat_train_set`):

```py
housing = strat_train_set.drop("median_house_value", axis=1)
housing_labels = strat_train_set["median_house_value"].copy()
```

#### 2.5.1 Data Cleaning

Most Machine Learning algorithms cannot work with missing features, so let’s create a few functions to take care of them. You noticed earlier that the `total_bedrooms` attribute has some missing values, so let’s fix this. You have three options:

• Get rid of the corresponding districts.

• Get rid of the whole attribute.

• Set the values to some value (zero, the mean, the median, etc.).

You can accomplish these easily using DataFrame’s `dropna()`, `drop()`, and `fillna()` methods:

```py
# option 1
housing.dropna(subset=["total_bedrooms"])
# option 2
housing.drop("total_bedrooms", axis=1)
# option 3
median = housing["total_bedrooms"].median() 
housing["total_bedrooms"].fillna(median, inplace=True)
```

If you choose option 3, you should compute the median value on the training set, and use it to fill the missing values in the training set, but also don’t forget to save the median value that you have computed. You will need it later to replace missing values in the test set when you want to evaluate your system, and also once the system goes live to replace missing values in new data.

Scikit-Learn provides a handy class to take care of missing values: SimpleImputer. Here is how to use it. First, you need to create a SimpleImputer instance, specifying that you want to replace each attribute’s missing values with the median of that attribute:

```py
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy="median")
```

Since the median can only be computed on numerical attributes, we need to create a copy of the data without the text attribute `ocean_proximity`:

```py
housing_num = housing.drop("ocean_proximity", axis=1)
```

Now you can fit the imputer instance to the training data using the `fit()` method:

```py
imputer.fit(housing_num)
```

The imputer has simply computed the median of each attribute and stored the result in its `statistics_` instance variable. Only the `total_bedrooms` attribute had missing values, but we cannot be sure that there won’t be any missing values in new data after the system goes live, so it is safer to apply the imputer to all the numerical attributes:

```py
>>> imputer.statistics_ 
array([ -118.51 , 34.26 , 29. , 2119.5 , 433. , 1164. , 408. , 3.5409])
>>> housing_num.median().values 
array([ -118.51 , 34.26 , 29. , 2119.5 , 433. , 1164. , 408. , 3.5409])
```

Now you can use this “trained” imputer to transform the training set by replacing missing values by the learned medians:

```py
X = imputer.transform(housing_num)
```

The result is a plain NumPy array containing the transformed features. If you want to put it back into a Pandas DataFrame, it’s simple:

```py
housing_tr = pd.DataFrame(X, columns=housing_num.columns)
```

#### Scikit-Learn Design

Scikit-Learn’s API is remarkably well designed. The main design principles are: [17] 

2-3『

[[1309.0238] API design for machine learning software: experiences from the scikit-learn project](https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.0238)

』——未完成

• Consistency. All objects share a consistent and simple interface:

— Estimators. Any object that can estimate some parameters based on a dataset is called an estimator (e.g., an imputer is an estimator). The estimation itself is performed by the `fit()` method, and it takes only a dataset as a parameter (or two for supervised learning algorithms; the second dataset contains the labels). Any other parameter needed to guide the estimation process is considered a hyperparameter (such as an imputer’s strategy), and it must be set as an instance variable (generally via a constructor parameter).

— Transformers. Some estimators (such as an imputer) can also transform a dataset; these are called transformers. Once again, the API is quite simple: the transformation is performed by the `transform()` method with the dataset to transform as a parameter. It returns the transformed dataset. This transformation generally relies on the learned parameters, as is the case for an imputer. All transformers also have a convenience method called `fit_transform()` that is equivalent to calling `fit()` and then `transform()` (but sometimes `fit_transform()` is optimized and runs much faster).

— Predictors. Finally, some estimators are capable of making predictions given a dataset; they are called predictors. For example, the LinearRegression model in the previous chapter was a predictor: it predicted life satisfaction given a country’s GDP per capita. A predictor has a `predict()` method that takes a dataset of new instances and returns a dataset of corresponding predictions. It also has a `score()` method that measures the quality of the predictions given a test set (and the corresponding labels in the case of supervised learning algorithms). [18] 

• Inspection. All the estimator’s hyperparameters are accessible directly via public instance variables (e.g., imputer.strategy), and all the estimator’s learned parameters are also accessible via public instance variables with an underscore suffix (e.g., imputer.statistics_).

• Nonproliferation of classes. Datasets are represented as NumPy arrays or SciPy sparse matrices, instead of homemade classes. Hyperparameters are just regular Python strings or numbers.

• Composition. Existing building blocks are reused as much as possible. For example, it is easy to create a Pipeline estimator from an arbitrary sequence of transformers followed by a final estimator, as we will see.

• Sensible defaults. Scikit-Learn provides reasonable default values for most parameters, making it easy to create a baseline working system quickly.

17 For more details on the design principles, see “API design for machine learning software: experiences from the scikit-learn project,” L. Buitinck, G. Louppe, M. Blondel, F. Pedregosa, A. Müller, et al. (2013).

18 Some predictors also provide methods to measure the confidence of their predictions.

#### 2.5.2 Handling Text and Categorical Attributes

Earlier we left out the categorical attribute `ocean_proximity` because it is a text attribute so we cannot compute its median:

```py
>>> housing_cat = housing[["ocean_proximity"]]
>>> housing_cat.head(10) 
ocean_proximity 
17606 <1H OCEAN 
18632 <1H OCEAN 
14650 NEAR OCEAN 
3230 INLAND 
3555 <1H OCEAN 
19480 INLAND 
8879 <1H OCEAN 
13685 INLAND 
4937 <1H OCEAN 
4861 <1H OCEAN
```

Most Machine Learning algorithms prefer to work with numbers anyway, so let’s convert these categories from text to numbers. For this, we can use Scikit-Learn’s Ordina lEncoder class [19] :

1『发现 Scikit-Learn 包里「类」很丰富啊。（2020-11-24）』

```py
>>> from sklearn.preprocessing import OrdinalEncoder
>>> ordinal_encoder = OrdinalEncoder()
>>> housing_cat_encoded = ordinal_encoder.fit_transform(housing_cat)
>>> housing_cat_encoded[:10] 
array([[0.], [0.], [4.], [1.], [0.], [1.], [0.], [1.], [0.], [0.]])
```

You can get the list of categories using the `categories_` instance variable. It is a list containing a 1D array of categories for each categorical attribute (in this case, a list containing a single array since there is just one categorical attribute):

```py
>>> ordinal_encoder.categories_ 
[array(['<1H OCEAN', 'INLAND', 'ISLAND', 'NEAR BAY', 'NEAR OCEAN'], dtype=object)]
```

One issue with this representation is that ML algorithms will assume that two nearby values are more similar than two distant values. This may be fine in some cases (e.g., for ordered categories such as “bad”, “average”, “good”, “excellent”), but it is obviously not the case for the `ocean_proximity` column (for example, categories 0 and 4 are clearly more similar than categories 0 and 1). To fix this issue, a common solution is to create one binary attribute per category: one attribute equal to 1 when the category is “<1H OCEAN” (and 0 otherwise), another attribute equal to 1 when the category is “INLAND” (and 0 otherwise), and so on. This is called one-hot encoding, because only one attribute will be equal to 1 (hot), while the others will be 0 (cold). The new attributes are sometimes called dummy attributes. Scikit-Learn provides a OneHotEn coder class to convert categorical values into one-hot vectors [20] :

```py
>>> from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder
>>> cat_encoder = OneHotEncoder()
>>> housing_cat_1hot = cat_encoder.fit_transform(housing_cat)
>>> housing_cat_1hot
<16512x5 sparse matrix of type '<class 'numpy.float64'>' with 16512 stored elements in Compressed Sparse Row format>
```

Notice that the output is a SciPy sparse matrix, instead of a NumPy array. This is very useful when you have categorical attributes with thousands of categories. After onehot encoding we get a matrix with thousands of columns, and the matrix is full of zeros except for a single 1 per row. Using up tons of memory mostly to store zeros would be very wasteful, so instead a sparse matrix only stores the location of the non‐zero elements. You can use it mostly like a normal 2D array, [21] but if you really want to convert it to a (dense) NumPy array, just call the `toarray()` method:

```py
>>> housing_cat_1hot.toarray() 
array([[1., 0., 0., 0., 0.], [1., 0., 0., 0., 0.], [0., 0., 0., 0., 1.], ..., [0., 1., 0., 0., 0.], [1., 0., 0., 0., 0.], [0., 0., 0., 1., 0.]])
```

Once again, you can get the list of categories using the encoder’s `categories_` instance variable:

```py
>>> cat_encoder.categories_ 
[array(['<1H OCEAN', 'INLAND', 'ISLAND', 'NEAR BAY', 'NEAR OCEAN'], dtype=object)]
```

If a categorical attribute has a large number of possible categories (e.g., country code, profession, species, etc.), then one-hot encoding will result in a large number of input features. This may slow down training and degrade performance. If this happens, you may want to replace the categorical input with useful numerical features related to the categories: for example, you could replace the `ocean_proximity` feature with the distance to the ocean (similarly, a country code could be replaced with the country’s population and GDP per capita). Alternatively, you could replace each category with a learnable low dimensional vector called an embedding. Each category’s representation would be learned during training: this is an example of representation learning (see Chapter 13 and ??? for more details).

1『难训练的属性可以用其他「好训练的属性」替代的。（2020-11-24）』

19 This class is available since Scikit-Learn 0.20. If you use an earlier version, please consider upgrading, or use Pandas’ `Series.factorize()` method.

20 Before Scikit-Learn 0.20, it could only encode integer categorical values, but since 0.20 it can also handle other types of inputs, including text categorical inputs.

#### 2.5.3 Custom Transformers

Although Scikit-Learn provides many useful transformers, you will need to write your own for tasks such as custom cleanup operations or combining specific attributes. You will want your transformer to work seamlessly with Scikit-Learn functionalities (such as pipelines), and since Scikit-Learn relies on duck typing (not inheritance), all you need is to create a class and implement three methods: `fit()` (returning self), `transform()`, and `fit_transform()`. You can get the last one for free by simply adding TransformerMixin as a base class. Also, if you add BaseEstima tor as a base class (and avoid `*args` and `**kargs` in your constructor) you will get two extra methods (`get_params()` and `set_params()`) that will be useful for auto‐matic hyperparameter tuning. For example, here is a small transformer class that adds the combined attributes we discussed earlier:

1『想不到这里看到了 duck typing，学习设计模式时，在面向对象编程范式里，涉及到「多态」时遇到的。走起来像鸭子、叫起来像鸭子，它就是鸭子。』

```py
from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin

rooms_ix, bedrooms_ix, population_ix, households_ix = 3, 4, 5, 6 

class CombinedAttributesAdder(BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin):
    def __init__(self, add_bedrooms_per_room = True): # no *args or **kargs 
        self.add_bedrooms_per_room = add_bedrooms_per_room 
    def fit(self, X, y=None):
        return self # nothing else to do
    def transform(self, X, y=None):
        rooms_per_household = X[:, rooms_ix] / X[:, households_ix]
        population_per_household = X[:, population_ix] / X[:, households_ix]
        if self.add_bedrooms_per_room:
            bedrooms_per_room = X[:, bedrooms_ix] / X[:, rooms_ix]
            return np.c_[X, rooms_per_household, population_per_household, bedrooms_per_room] 
        else:
            return np.c_[X, rooms_per_household, population_per_household] 

attr_adder = CombinedAttributesAdder(add_bedrooms_per_room=False) 
housing_extra_attribs = attr_adder.transform(housing.values)
```

In this example the transformer has one hyperparameter, `add_bedrooms_per_room`, set to True by default (it is often helpful to provide sensible defaults). This hyperparameter will allow you to easily find out whether adding this attribute helps the Machine Learning algorithms or not. More generally, you can add a hyperparameter to gate any data preparation step that you are not 100% sure about. The more you automate these data preparation steps, the more combinations you can automatically try out, making it much more likely that you will find a great combination (and saving you a lot of time).

21 See SciPy’s documentation for more details.

#### 2.5.4 Feature Scaling

One of the most important transformations you need to apply to your data is feature scaling. With few exceptions, Machine Learning algorithms don’t perform well when the input numerical attributes have very different scales. This is the case for the housing data: the total number of rooms ranges from about 6 to 39,320, while the median incomes only range from 0 to 15. Note that scaling the target values is generally not required.

There are two common ways to get all attributes to have the same scale: min-max scaling and standardization.

Min-max scaling (many people call this normalization) is quite simple: values are shifted and rescaled so that they end up ranging from 0 to 1. We do this by subtracting the min value and dividing by the max minus the min. Scikit-Learn provides a transformer called MinMaxScaler for this. It has a `feature_range` hyperparameter that lets you change the range if you don’t want 0–1 for some reason.

Standardization is quite different: first it subtracts the mean value (so standardized values always have a zero mean), and then it divides by the standard deviation so that the resulting distribution has unit variance. Unlike min-max scaling, standardization does not bound values to a specific range, which may be a problem for some algorithms (e.g., neural networks often expect an input value ranging from 0 to 1). However, standardization is much less affected by outliers. For example, suppose a district had a median income equal to 100 (by mistake). Min-max scaling would then crush all the other values from 0–15 down to 0–0.15, whereas standardization would not be much affected. Scikit-Learn provides a transformer called StandardScaler for standardization.

As with all the transformations, it is important to fit the scalers to the training data only, not to the full dataset (including the test set). Only then can you use them to transform the training set and the test set (and new data).

2『数据清洗之归一化标准化，做一张主题卡片。』——已完成

#### 2.5.5 Transformation Pipelines

As you can see, there are many data transformation steps that need to be executed in the right order. Fortunately, Scikit-Learn provides the Pipeline class to help with such sequences of transformations. Here is a small pipeline for the numerical attributes:

```py
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline 
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

num_pipeline = Pipeline([
        ('imputer', SimpleImputer(strategy="median")),
        ('attribs_adder', CombinedAttributesAdder()), 
        ('std_scaler', StandardScaler()),
    ])
housing_num_tr = num_pipeline.fit_transform(housing_num)
```

1『管道化，又是一个熟悉的概念，耗子叔编程范式里，函数式编程那边讲到过，管道化后的代码真的好简洁、优雅。（2020-11-24）』

The Pipeline constructor takes a list of name/estimator pairs defining a sequence of steps. All but the last estimator must be transformers (i.e., they must have a `fit_transform()` method). The names can be anything you like (as long as they are unique and don’t contain double underscores “__”): they will come in handy later for hyperparameter tuning.

When you call the pipeline’s `fit()` method, it calls `fit_transform()` sequentially on all transformers, passing the output of each call as the parameter to the next call, until it reaches the final estimator, for which it just calls the `fit()` method.

The pipeline exposes the same methods as the final estimator. In this example, the last estimator is a StandardScaler, which is a transformer, so the pipeline has a trans `form()` method that applies all the transforms to the data in sequence (and of course also a `fit_transform()` method, which is the one we used).

So far, we have handled the categorical columns and the numerical columns separately. It would be more convenient to have a single transformer able to handle all columns, applying the appropriate transformations to each column. In version 0.20, Scikit-Learn introduced the ColumnTransformer for this purpose, and the good news is that it works great with Pandas DataFrames. Let’s use it to apply all the transformations to the housing data:

```py
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer

num_attribs = list(housing_num)
cat_attribs = ["ocean_proximity"]

full_pipeline = ColumnTransformer([
        ("num", num_pipeline, num_attribs), 
        ("cat", OneHotEncoder(), cat_attribs), 
    ])

housing_prepared = full_pipeline.fit_transform(housing)
```

Here is how this works: first we import the ColumnTransformer class, next we get the list of numerical column names and the list of categorical column names, and we construct a ColumnTransformer. The constructor requires a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a name [22] , a transformer and a list of names (or indices) of columns that the transformer should be applied to. In this example, we specify that the numerical columns should be transformed using the `num_pipeline` that we defined earlier, and the categorical columns should be transformed using a OneHotEncoder. Finally, we apply this ColumnTransformer to the housing data: it applies each transformer to the appropriate columns and concatenates the outputs along the second axis (the transformers must return the same number of rows).

Note that the OneHotEncoder returns a sparse matrix, while the `num_pipeline` returns a dense matrix. When there is such a mix of sparse and dense matrices, the Colum nTransformer estimates the density of the final matrix (i.e., the ratio of non-zero cells), and it returns a sparse matrix if the density is lower than a given threshold (by default, `sparse_threshold=0.3`). In this example, it returns a dense matrix. And that’s it! We have a preprocessing pipeline that takes the full housing data and applies the appropriate transformations to each column.

Instead of a transformer, you can specify the string "drop" if you want the columns to be dropped. Or you can specify "pass through" if you want the columns to be left untouched. By default, the remaining columns (i.e., the ones that were not listed) will be dropped, but you can set the remainder hyperparameter to any transformer (or to "passthrough") if you want these columns to be handled differently.

If you are using Scikit-Learn 0.19 or earlier, you can use a third-party library such as sklearn-pandas, or roll out your own custom transformer to get the same functionality as the ColumnTransformer. Alternatively, you can use the FeatureUnion class which can also apply different transformers and concatenate their outputs, but you cannot specify different columns for each transformer, they all apply to the whole data. It is possible to work around this limitation using a custom transformer for column selection (see the Jupyter notebook for an example).

22 Just like for pipelines, the name can be anything as long as it does not contain double underscores.

### 2.6 Select and Train a Model

At last! You framed the problem, you got the data and explored it, you sampled a training set and a test set, and you wrote transformation pipelines to clean up and prepare your data for Machine Learning algorithms automatically. You are now ready to select and train a Machine Learning model.

#### 2.6.1 Training and Evaluating on the Training Set

The good news is that thanks to all these previous steps, things are now going to be much simpler than you might think. Let’s first train a Linear Regression model, like we did in the previous chapter:

```py
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

lin_reg = LinearRegression() 
lin_reg.fit(housing_prepared, housing_labels)
```

Done! You now have a working Linear Regression model. Let’s try it out on a few instances from the training set:

```py
>>> some_data = housing.iloc[:5]
>>> some_labels = housing_labels.iloc[:5]
>>> some_data_prepared = full_pipeline.transform(some_data)
>>> print("Predictions:", lin_reg.predict(some_data_prepared)) 
Predictions: [ 210644.6045 317768.8069 210956.4333 59218.9888 189747.5584]
>>> print("Labels:", list(some_labels))
Labels: [286600.0, 340600.0, 196900.0, 46300.0, 254500.0]
```

It works, although the predictions are not exactly accurate (e.g., the first prediction is off by close to 40%!). Let’s measure this regression model’s RMSE on the whole training set using Scikit-Learn’s `mean_squared_error` function:

```py
>>> from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
>>> housing_predictions = lin_reg.predict(housing_prepared)
>>> lin_mse = mean_squared_error(housing_labels, housing_predictions)
>>> lin_rmse = np.sqrt(lin_mse)
>>> lin_rmse
68628.19819848922
```

Okay, this is better than nothing but clearly not a great score: most districts’ `median_housing_values` range between `$120,000` and `$265,000`, so a typical prediction error of `$68,628` is not very satisfying. This is an example of a model underfitting the training data. When this happens it can mean that the features do not provide enough information to make good predictions, or that the model is not powerful enough. As we saw in the previous chapter, the main ways to fix underfitting are to select a more powerful model, to feed the training algorithm with better features, or to reduce the constraints on the model. This model is not regularized, so this rules out the last option. You could try to add more features (e.g., the log of the population), but first let’s try a more complex model to see how it does.

Let’s train a DecisionTreeRegressor. This is a powerful model, capable of finding complex nonlinear relationships in the data (Decision Trees are presented in more detail in Chapter 6). The code should look familiar by now:

```py
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor

tree_reg = DecisionTreeRegressor() 
tree_reg.fit(housing_prepared, housing_labels)
```

Now that the model is trained, let’s evaluate it on the training set:

```py
>>> housing_predictions = tree_reg.predict(housing_prepared)
>>> tree_mse = mean_squared_error(housing_labels, housing_predictions)
>>> tree_rmse = np.sqrt(tree_mse)
>>> tree_rmse
0.0
```

Wait, what!? No error at all? Could this model really be absolutely perfect? Of course, it is much more likely that the model has badly overfit the data. How can you be sure? As we saw earlier, you don’t want to touch the test set until you are ready to launch a model you are confident about, so you need to use part of the training set for training, and part for model validation.

#### 2.6.2 Better Evaluation Using Cross-Validation

One way to evaluate the Decision Tree model would be to use the `train_test_split` function to split the training set into a smaller training set and a validation set, then train your models against the smaller training set and evaluate them against the validation set. It’s a bit of work, but nothing too difficult and it would work fairly well.

A great alternative is to use Scikit-Learn’s K-fold cross-validation feature. The following code randomly splits the training set into 10 distinct subsets called folds, then it trains and evaluates the Decision Tree model 10 times, picking a different fold for evaluation every time and training on the other 9 folds. The result is an array containing the 10 evaluation scores:

```py
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score 
scores = cross_val_score(tree_reg, housing_prepared, housing_labels,
                        scoring="neg_mean_squared_error", cv=10)
tree_rmse_scores = np.sqrt(-scores)
```

Scikit-Learn’s cross-validation features expect a utility function (greater is better) rather than a cost function (lower is better), so the scoring function is actually the opposite of the MSE (i.e., a negative value), which is why the preceding code computes -scores before calculating the square root.

Let’s look at the results:

```py
>>> 
def display_scores(scores):
    print("Scores:", scores)
    print("Mean:", scores.mean())
    print("Standard deviation:", scores.std())

>>> display_scores(tree_rmse_scores)

Scores: [70194.33680785 66855.16363941 72432.58244769 70758.73896782 71115.88230639 75585.14172901 70262.86139133 70273.6325285 75366.87952553 71231.65726027] 
Mean: 71407.68766037929 
Standard deviation: 2439.4345041191004
```

Now the Decision Tree doesn’t look as good as it did earlier. In fact, it seems to perform worse than the Linear Regression model! Notice that cross-validation allows you to get not only an estimate of the performance of your model, but also a measure of how precise this estimate is (i.e., its standard deviation). The Decision Tree has a score of approximately 71,407, generally ±2,439. You would not have this information if you just used one validation set. But cross-validation comes at the cost of training the model several times, so it is not always possible. Let’s compute the same scores for the Linear Regression model just to be sure:

```py
>>> lin_scores = cross_val_score(lin_reg, housing_prepared, housing_labels, scoring="neg_mean_squared_error", cv=10)
>>> lin_rmse_scores = np.sqrt(-lin_scores)
>>> display_scores(lin_rmse_scores)

Scores: [66782.73843989 66960.118071 70347.95244419 74739.57052552 68031.13388938 71193.84183426 64969.63056405 68281.61137997 71552.91566558 67665.10082067] 
Mean: 69052.46136345083 
Standard deviation: 2731.674001798348
```

That’s right: the Decision Tree model is overfitting so badly that it performs worse than the Linear Regression model.

Let’s try one last model now: the RandomForestRegressor. As we will see in Chapter 7, Random Forests work by training many Decision Trees on random subsets of the features, then averaging out their predictions. Building a model on top of many other models is called Ensemble Learning, and it is often a great way to push ML algorithms even further. We will skip most of the code since it is essentially the same as for the other models:

```py
>>> from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
>>> forest_reg = RandomForestRegressor()
>>> forest_reg.fit(housing_prepared, housing_labels)

>>> housing_predictions = forest_reg.predict(housing_prepared)
>>> forest_mse = mean_squared_error(housing_labels, housing_predictions)
>>> forest_rmse = np.sqrt(forest_mse)
>>> forest_rmse
18603.515021376355

>>> 
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

forest_scores = cross_val_score(forest_reg, housing_prepared, housing_labels,
                                scoring="neg_mean_squared_error", cv=10)
forest_rmse_scores = np.sqrt(-forest_scores)
display_scores(forest_rmse_scores)

Scores: [49519.80364233 47461.9115823 50029.02762854 52325.28068953 49308.39426421 53446.37892622 48634.8036574 47585.73832311 53490.10699751 50021.5852922 ]

』

Wow, this is much better: Random Forests look very promising. However, note that the score on the training set is still much lower than on the validation sets, meaning that the model is still overfitting the training set. Possible solutions for overfitting are to simplify the model, constrain it (i.e., regularize it), or get a lot more training data. However, before you dive much deeper in Random Forests, you should try out many other models from various categories of Machine Learning algorithms (several Support Vector Machines with different kernels, possibly a neural network, etc.), without spending too much time tweaking the hyperparameters. The goal is to shortlist a few (two to five) promising models.

You should save every model you experiment with, so you can come back easily to any model you want. Make sure you save both the hyperparameters and the trained parameters, as well as the cross-validation scores and perhaps the actual predictions as well. This will allow you to easily compare scores across model types, and compare the types of errors they make. You can easily save Scikit-Learn models by using Python’s pickle module, or using sklearn.externals.joblib, which is more efficient at serializing large NumPy arrays:

```py
from sklearn.externals import joblib

joblib.dump(my_model, "my_model.pkl") # and later...
my_model_loaded = joblib.load("my_model.pkl")
```

### 2.7 Fine-Tune Your Model

Let’s assume that you now have a shortlist of promising models. You now need to fine-tune them. Let’s look at a few ways you can do that.

#### 2.7.1 Grid Search

One way to do that would be to fiddle with the hyperparameters manually, until you find a great combination of hyperparameter values. This would be very tedious work, and you may not have time to explore many combinations.

Instead you should get Scikit-Learn’s GridSearchCV to search for you. All you need to do is tell it which hyperparameters you want it to experiment with, and what values to try out, and it will evaluate all the possible combinations of hyperparameter values, using cross-validation. For example, the following code searches for the best combination of hyperparameter values for the RandomForestRegressor:

```py
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

param_grid = [
    # try 12 (3×4) combinations of hyperparameters
    {'n_estimators': [3, 10, 30], 'max_features': [2, 4, 6, 8]},
    # then try 6 (2×3) combinations with bootstrap set as False
    {'bootstrap': [False], 'n_estimators': [3, 10], 'max_features': [2, 3, 4]},
  ]

forest_reg = RandomForestRegressor(random_state=42)
# train across 5 folds, that's a total of (12+6)*5=90 rounds of training 
grid_search = GridSearchCV(forest_reg, param_grid, cv=5,
                           scoring='neg_mean_squared_error',
                           return_train_score=True)
grid_search.fit(housing_prepared, housing_labels)
```

When you have no idea what value a hyperparameter should have, a simple approach is to try out consecutive powers of 10 (or a smaller number if you want a more fine-grained search, as shown in this example with the n_estimators hyperparameter).

This param_grid tells Scikit-Learn to first evaluate all 3 × 4 = 12 combinations of n_estimators and max_features hyperparameter values specified in the first dict (don’t worry about what these hyperparameters mean for now; they will be explained in Chapter 7), then try all 2 × 3 = 6 combinations of hyperparameter values in the second dict, but this time with the bootstrap hyperparameter set to False instead of True (which is the default value for this hyperparameter).

All in all, the grid search will explore 12 + 6 = 18 combinations of RandomForestRe gressor hyperparameter values, and it will train each model five times (since we are using five-fold cross validation). In other words, all in all, there will be 18 × 5 = 90 rounds of training! It may take quite a long time, but when it is done you can get the best combination of parameters like this:

```py
>>> grid_search.best_params_ 
{'max_features': 8, 'n_estimators': 30}
```

Since 8 and 30 are the maximum values that were evaluated, you should probably try searching again with higher values, since the score may continue to improve.

You can also get the best estimator directly:

```py
>>> grid_search.best_estimator_ 
RandomForestRegressor(bootstrap=True, criterion='mse', max_depth=None,
    max_features=8, max_leaf_nodes=None, min_impurity_decrease=0.0,
    min_impurity_split=None, min_samples_leaf=1,
    min_samples_split=2, min_weight_fraction_leaf=0.0,
    n_estimators=30, n_jobs=None, oob_score=False, random_state=None,
    verbose=0, warm_start=False)
```

If GridSearchCV is initialized with refit=True (which is the default), then once it finds the best estimator using crossvalidation, it retrains it on the whole training set. This is usually a good idea since feeding it more data will likely improve its performance.

And of course the evaluation scores are also available:

```py
>>> cvres = grid_search.cv_results_
>>> for mean_score, params in zip(cvres["mean_test_score"], cvres["params"]):
>>> print(np.sqrt(-mean_score), params) 
```

In this example, we obtain the best solution by setting the max_features hyperparameter to 8, and the n_estimators hyperparameter to 30. The RMSE score for this combination is 49,682, which is slightly better than the score you got earlier using the default hyperparameter values (which was 50,182). Congratulations, you have successfully fine-tuned your best model!

Don’t forget that you can treat some of the data preparation steps as hyperparameters. For example, the grid search will automatically find out whether or not to add a feature you were not sure about (e.g., using the add_bedrooms_per_room hyperparameter of your CombinedAttributesAdder transformer). It may similarly be used to automatically find the best way to handle outliers, missing features, feature selection, and more.

#### 2.7.2 Randomized Search

The grid search approach is fine when you are exploring relatively few combinations, like in the previous example, but when the hyperparameter search space is large, it is often preferable to use RandomizedSearchCV instead. This class can be used in much the same way as the GridSearchCV class, but instead of trying out all possible combinations, it evaluates a given number of random combinations by selecting a random value for each hyperparameter at every iteration. This approach has two main benefits:

• If you let the randomized search run for, say, 1,000 iterations, this approach will explore 1,000 different values for each hyperparameter (instead of just a few values per hyperparameter with the grid search approach).

• You have more control over the computing budget you want to allocate to hyperparameter search, simply by setting the number of iterations.

#### 2.7.3 Ensemble Methods

Another way to fine-tune your system is to try to combine the models that perform best. The group (or “ensemble”) will often perform better than the best individual model (just like Random Forests perform better than the individual Decision Trees they rely on), especially if the individual models make very different types of errors. We will cover this topic in more detail in Chapter 7.

#### 2.7.4 Analyze the Best Models and Their Errors

You will often gain good insights on the problem by inspecting the best models. For example, the RandomForestRegressor can indicate the relative importance of each attribute for making accurate predictions:

```py
>>> feature_importances = grid_search.best_estimator_.feature_importances_
>>> feature_importances
array([7.33442355e-02, 6.29090705e-02, 4.11437985e-02, 1.46726854e-02,
    1.41064835e-02, 1.48742809e-02, 1.42575993e-02, 3.66158981e-01,
    5.64191792e-02, 1.08792957e-01, 5.33510773e-02, 1.03114883e-02,
    1.64780994e-01, 6.02803867e-05, 1.96041560e-03, 2.85647464e-03])
```

Let’s display these importance scores next to their corresponding attribute names:

```py
>>> extra_attribs = ["rooms_per_hhold", "pop_per_hhold", "bedrooms_per_room"]
>>> cat_encoder = full_pipeline.named_transformers_["cat"]
>>> cat_one_hot_attribs = list(cat_encoder.categories_[0])
>>> attributes = num_attribs + extra_attribs + cat_one_hot_attribs
>>> sorted(zip(feature_importances, attributes), reverse=True)
```

With this information, you may want to try dropping some of the less useful features (e.g., apparently only one `ocean_proximity` category is really useful, so you could try dropping the others).

You should also look at the specific errors that your system makes, then try to understand why it makes them and what could fix the problem (adding extra features or, on the contrary, getting rid of uninformative ones, cleaning up outliers, etc.).

#### 2.7.5 Evaluate Your System on the Test Set

After tweaking your models for a while, you eventually have a system that performs sufficiently well. Now is the time to evaluate the final model on the test set. There is nothing special about this process; just get the predictors and the labels from your test set, run your full_pipeline to transform the data (call transform(), not fit_transform(), you do not want to fit the test set!), and evaluate the final model on the test set:

```py
final_model = grid_search.best_estimator_

X_test = strat_test_set.drop("median_house_value", axis=1)
y_test = strat_test_set["median_house_value"].copy()

X_test_prepared = full_pipeline.transform(X_test)
final_predictions = final_model.predict(X_test_prepared)

final_mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, final_predictions)
final_rmse = np.sqrt(final_mse)
```

In some cases, such a point estimate of the generalization error will not be quite enough to convince you to launch: what if it is just 0.1% better than the model currently in production? You might want to have an idea of how precise this estimate is. For this, you can compute a 95% confidence interval for the generalization error using scipy.stats.t.interval():

```py
from scipy import stats

confidence = 0.95
squared_errors = (final_predictions - y_test) ** 2
np.sqrt(stats.t.interval(confidence, len(squared_errors) - 1,
                         loc=squared_errors.mean(),
                         scale=stats.sem(squared_errors)))

# out
array([45685.10470776, 49691.25001878])
```

The performance will usually be slightly worse than what you measured using crossvalidation if you did a lot of hyperparameter tuning (because your system ends up fine-tuned to perform well on the validation data, and will likely not perform as well on unknown datasets). It is not the case in this example, but when this happens you must resist the temptation to tweak the hyperparameters to make the numbers look good on the test set; the improvements would be unlikely to generalize to new data.

Now comes the project prelaunch phase: you need to present your solution (highlighting what you have learned, what worked and what did not, what assumptions were made, and what your system’s limitations are), document everything, and create nice presentations with clear visualizations and easy-to-remember statements (e.g., “the median income is the number one predictor of housing prices”). In this California housing example, the final performance of the system is not better than the experts’, but it may still be a good idea to launch it, especially if this frees up some time for the experts so they can work on more interesting and productive tasks.

### 2.8 Launch, Monitor, and Maintain Your System

Perfect, you got approval to launch! You need to get your solution ready for production, in particular by plugging the production input data sources into your system and writing tests.

You also need to write monitoring code to check your system’s live performance at regular intervals and trigger alerts when it drops. This is important to catch not only sudden breakage, but also performance degradation. This is quite common because models tend to “rot” as data evolves over time, unless the models are regularly trained on fresh data.

Evaluating your system’s performance will require sampling the system’s predictions and evaluating them. This will generally require a human analysis. These analysts may be field experts, or workers on a crowdsourcing platform (such as Amazon Mechanical Turk or CrowdFlower). Either way, you need to plug the human evaluation pipeline into your system.

You should also make sure you evaluate the system’s input data quality. Sometimes performance will degrade slightly because of a poor quality signal (e.g., a malfunctioning sensor sending random values, or another team’s output becoming stale), but it may take a while before your system’s performance degrades enough to trigger an alert. If you monitor your system’s inputs, you may catch this earlier. Monitoring the inputs is particularly important for online learning systems.

Finally, you will generally want to train your models on a regular basis using fresh data. You should automate this process as much as possible. If you don’t, you are very likely to refresh your model only every six months (at best), and your system’s performance may fluctuate severely over time. If your system is an online learning system, you should make sure you save snapshots of its state at regular intervals so you can easily roll back to a previously working state.

### 2.9 Try It Out

Hopefully this chapter gave you a good idea of what a Machine Learning project looks like, and showed you some of the tools you can use to train a great system. As you can see, much of the work is in the data preparation step, building monitoring tools, setting up human evaluation pipelines, and automating regular model training. The Machine Learning algorithms are also important, of course, but it is probably preferable to be comfortable with the overall process and know three or four algorithms well rather than to spend all your time exploring advanced algorithms and not enough time on the overall process.

So, if you have not already done so, now is a good time to pick up a laptop, select a dataset that you are interested in, and try to go through the whole process from A to Z. A good place to start is on a competition website such as http://kaggle.com/: you will have a dataset to play with, a clear goal, and people to share the experience with.
