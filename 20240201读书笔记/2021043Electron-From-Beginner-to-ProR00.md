### 0101. 主题卡 —— Node 的概念

Node.js was initially released in 2009 as an open source project, enabling developers to create server-side applications using JavaScript. What made this project interesting was that it leveraged Google's newly open sourced V8 engine to act as its JavaScript runtime. A top of that runtime, the project added APIs for accessing the local file system, creating servers, as well as the ability to load modules.

Node has enjoyed a tremendous surge of popularity from across the development community. As such, there is a huge collection of modules that are available for use within your Electron application.

1-2『这里的信息让自己对 Node 有了一个初步的了解，Node 原来也是一种后端语言，基于 JS 的后端语言。那么之前听耗子哥说的，「JS 是唯一前后端通吃的语言」，此时才算理解。Node 的概念做一张主题卡片。（2021-03-25）』

### 0201. 术语卡 —— Chromium

Chromium is the open source version of Google's Chrome web browser. Although it shares much of the same code base and feature set, there are a few differences (albeit minor) and it is released under a different license. What is included with Electron is technically the Chromium Content Module (CCM). Quite the mouthful, hence why most simply refer it is as Chromium. But what is the Chromium Content Module? It is the core code that makes a web browser a web browser. It includes the Blink rendering engine and its own V8 JavaScript engine. The CCM will handle retrieving and rendering HTML, loading and parsing CSS, and executing JavaScript as well.

The CCM only focuses on the core needs to render a web page. Additional features, like supporting Chrome Extensions, or syncing your Chrome bookmarks, are not supported. Just remember that its core purpose is to render web content.
