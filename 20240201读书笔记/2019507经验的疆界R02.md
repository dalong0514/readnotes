GENERATING NOVELTY

Although there are numerous unresolved problems, theories of adaptation deal reasonably well with the efficiencies and surprises associated with the processes by which existing ideas, practices, forms, or products survive and reproduce (Cyert and March 1963; March 1988, chap. 8; 1994; 1999a, chap. 15; Nelson and Winter 1982; Hannan and Freeman 1989; Cohen and Sproull 1996; March, Schulz, and Zhou 2000; Hodgkinson and Starbuck 2008). Theories of adaptation typically deal less well with the exploratory processes by which new ideas, forms, products, or practices are created, made available, and protected from premature elimination (Becker, Knudsen, and March 2006). These latter processes and notions about them constitute the rudiments of a theory of novelty and are the focus of this chapter.

Two preliminary caveats may be worth recording. The first is that a theory of novelty deals primarily with global novelty, not local novelty. It focuses on the generation of attributes or practices that are new to a population of organizations, not just new to the organization to which they spread. Theories of the spread of things are essential to understanding organizational innovation and adaptation, but they are somewhat different from theories of the generation of new ideas. In particular, a primary feature of local innovativeness is the base level of ignorance in the innovator. To a novice lover, all techniques of lovemaking are exciting discoveries, regardless of their familiarity to others. Likewise, an experienced scholar is less inclined to claim originality than is a beginner.

The second caveat is that studies of novelty and creativity are sometimes confused by a tendency to conflate the two. Novelty is deviation from established procedures or knowledge; creativity is novelty that is subsequently judged successful. Novelty is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for creativity. Thus, many of the individual and social attributes that lead to novelty will also lead to creativity, but the complications of identifying the social and competitive processes by which novelty is confirmed as creativity are ignored by a theory of novelty.

In addition, this chapter treats two assumptions as more or less self-evident. The first is that most novel ideas are bad ones — that is, they will subsequently be judged unsuccessful. Only a small, unpredictable fraction of novel initiatives will turn out to be successful. The second assumption is that when novel ideas are generated, there is no reliable way to anticipate which of them will be successful. The few novel ideas that will prove to be creative are indistinguishable from those that will not until considerable time has passed. These two properties of novelty are critical to understanding the problems with novelty.

尽管还有很多问题悬而未决，但是适应理论把与老想法、老实务、老形式或老产品生存繁衍过程有关的效率和意外处理得相当好（Cyert and March 1963；March 1988，第 8 章；1994；1999a，第 15 章；Nelson and Winter 1982；Hannan and Freeman 1989；Cohen and Sproull 1996；March，Schulz，and Zhou 2000；Hodgkinson and Starbuck 2008）。适应理论对创造、利用并保护新想法、新实务、新形式或新产品免遭淘汰的探索过程处理得不太好（Becker，Knudsen，and March 2006）。后面这个过程以及有关这一过程的理念构成了新事物理论的雏形，是本章的讨论焦点。

在正式讨论之前，有两点需要提醒一下读者。

第一，新事物理论主要处理对整体而言的新事物，而不是对局部而言的新事物。新事物理论集中关注的新属性或新实务，整个组织群都不熟悉，而不是仅仅哪个组织不熟悉。事物传播理论对理解组织创新与适应必不可少，但是与新事物产生理论多多少少有所不同。特别是，局部创新的一个主要特征就是创新者孤陋寡闻。对初尝云雨的人而言，所有房中术都是令人兴奋的新发现，不管其他人对这些房中术有多么熟悉。同样，与初做学问的人相比，经验丰富的学者不大可能宣称自己的东西是原创。

第二，新事物研究和创造力研究有时把新事物和创造物混为一谈。新事物是偏离成规定见的事物，而创造物是后来被判定为成功的新事物。新事物是创造物的必要非充分条件。因此，很多带来新事物的个人属性和社会属性也会带来创造物，但是新事物理论不关注新事物被判定为创造物的社会过程和竞争过程中出现的问题。

另外，本章把两个假定看成多多少少是不证自明的。第一个假定是，大多数新想法是坏想法，也就是后来会被判定为失败，只有少数几个新想法最后会成功。第二个假定是，没有可靠的方法预测哪个新想法会成功。少数几个最终会被判定为创意的新想法与大多数最终不会被判定为创意的新想法是区分不开的，除非经过很长一段时间的考验。新事物的这两个特点对理解与新事物有关的问题至关重要。

### 4.1 适应是新事物的敌人

ADAPTATION AS AN ENEMY OF NOVELTY

The proposition that humans conserve beliefs and practices and thus are hostile to novelty is well known to the study of social psychology (Lord, Ross, and Lepper 1979; Nickerson 1998). It is also characteristic of learning from experience. As we observed in chapter 2, new rules, routines, forms, and ideas are disadvantaged by the way the replication of success leads to increasing stability in choice. This is partly because novel things have properties that place them at risk. Their outcome distributions tend to have low means and high variances; they often require practice; their returns are often delayed in time and are often global rather than local. It is also partly because the replication of success tends to find a satisfactory (possibly because of chance) alternative and stick with it, particularly if alternatives require practice in order to realize their potential. The replication of success reduces the likelihood of throwing good money after bad, but it also means that good alternatives with poor initial results will be permanently passed over.

Similarly, as pointed out in chapter 3, learning through the construction of stories and models is implicitly hostile to novelty. Stories and models are created out of familiar elements linked together in familiar ways. The familiarity and flexibility of story and model frames make them endure and thereby provide a barrier to new experience or new frames. New things are not experienced because they are coded into narratives and models that preserve existing frames and thereby, in an important sense, do not occur as episodes from which new lessons can be learned. The proposition that there is nothing new under the sun is a proposition as much about the stories that are told and the models that are created as it is about the reality they purport to understand. The construction of stories and models of experience out of familiar themes assures that the lessons of experience will be easily understood and readily assimilated, but it also inhibits new themes and new interpretations. The novelty that will endure is primarily novelty that can be assimilated into old stories and models, which tends to exclude extremely deviant items (March 1992).

Because of these features of adaptation to experience, one of the more common themes of research on adaptation and of the literatures on technological, organizational, or intellectual change is the notion that novelty is not favored by adaptive processes (Garud, Nayyar, and Shapira 1997; Van de Ven 1999). New, deviant ideas are likely to be bad ones (Simonton 1995, 1999; Sutton 2002), and any general inclination to invent and reproduce new ideas is likely to lead to disaster. Moreover, even good new ideas are likely to lead to unfavorable results in the near temporal and spatial distance and thus are unlikely to endure long enough to exhibit their potential value.

Processes that produce actions having a large number of negative outcomes and only a small number of positive ones, most of which are delayed considerably or realized at a distance from the locus of adaptation, are prime candidates for elimination by adaptive processes, even though their expected value may qualify them for survival (Denrell and March 2001; Denrell 2007). In part, this is because adaptive processes, as we normally observe and model them, are myopic. They are relatively insensitive to outcomes that are separated in time or space from the locus of adaptation (Levinthal and March 1993; Levinthal and Posen 2008). This feature of adaptation underlies problems of delayed gratification (self-control) and distant gratification (altruism). It also underlies problems with novelty.

The tendency toward eliminating variability is strengthened by diffusion from others. An important mechanism for the replication of successful practices, routines, and forms is the spread of rules through a connected population (Strang and Soule 1998). Imitation leads to homogenization of practices across individuals and organizations that are connected in such a way that their attributes are visible (DiMaggio and Powell 1983; Djelic 1998). Diffusion of practices among connected organizations is limited by well-known difficulties of reproducing routines (Czarniawska and Sevón 1996, 2005), but it results in considerable convergence and the reduction of variation, particularly where the likelihood of imitating an attribute is increased by the number of organizations exhibiting the attribute (Singh, Tucker, and House 1986; Carroll and Hannan 1989; Hannan 1998).

In short, exploitation drives out exploration (March and Simon 1958, 185; Holland 1975; March 1999c, chap. 7). It seems likely that a theory of novelty will have to provide an understanding of how processes that generate novelty and heterogeneity can survive in the face of processes of refinement and imitation that seem likely to eliminate novelty and its progenitors if they themselves are to survive (Van de Ven 1999; Nooteboom 2000).

社会心理学研究有个著名命题：人类容易形成习惯思维和习惯做法，因此对新事物怀有敌意（Lord，Ross，and Lepper 1979；Nickerson 1998）。这也是从经验中学习的特点。正如我们在第 2 章中看到的那样，复制成功导致选择趋于稳定，这就造成新规则、新程序、新形式和新想法不受环境待见。为什么呢？一个原因是，新事物风险较大。新事物的结果分布，平均值低、方差高；新事物往往要求练习；新事物的回报，往往在时间上延迟，在空间上分散。另外一个原因是，复制成功往往会（也许因为偶然）找到一个令人满意的选项然后坚持这个选项，特别是如果选项要求练习才能实现潜力的话。复制成功可以降低「想捞回损失反赔上老本」的可能性，但是复制成功也意味着永久砍掉初始结果不好的选项。

类似的，正如第 3 章指出的那样，通过建构故事和模型而学习，对新生事物也有潜在威胁。故事和模型是用熟悉的方式把熟悉的要素连接在一起而创造出来的。故事和模型框架具有熟悉性和灵活性，这让故事和模型得以长久存在，同时也为新经验或新框架制造了障碍。新事物几乎体验不了，因为新事物往往是用旧框架编码成故事和模型的，这样就很难从中挖掘新启示，就像用旧瓶装新酒就很难品出新滋味一样。新事物的呈现形式让人不能从中挖掘新启示。就像太阳底下无新事一样，故事和模型之中无新启示。用熟悉的主题建构故事和模型，有助于从经验中理解并吸收启示，但也会抑制新主题和新诠释。能够长久存在的新事物主要是那些可以轻易整合进老故事和老模型的新事物，而老故事和老模型往往排斥极端异常的新事物（March 1992）。

因为对经验的适应具有这些特点，所以有关适应的研究和有关技术变革、组织变革或知识变革的文献有一个比较常见的主题：不被适应过程接纳的新事物（Garud，Nayyar，and Shapira 1997；Van de Ven 1999）。新的、异常的想法很有可能是坏想法（Simonton 1999；Sutton 2002），任何组织，如果普遍倾向于发明、繁殖新想法，都很有可能招致灾难。此外，即使是好想法，短期之内或局部的结果也有可能是坏的，因此不能坚持足够长的时间展现潜在价值。

会带来大量负面结果和少量正面结果，而且大部分正面结果在时间上延迟、在空间上分散的选项，是适应过程的重点淘汰对象，即使从期望值来看这个选项应该生存下去（Denrell and March 2001；Denrell 2007）。这部分是因为适应，正如我们通常观察并建模的那样，是短视的。适应对回报在时间上延迟或在空间上偏离本地的选项相对不敏感（Levinthal and March 1993；Levinthal and Posen 2008）。适应的这一特征，是延迟满足（自我控制）和奉献满足（利他主义）问题的根本所在，也是与新事物有关的问题的根本所在。

适应倾向于消灭变异，而模仿会加强这一倾向。复制成功的一个重要机制是模仿（Strang and Soule 1998）。因为模仿，所以实务传遍互有联系的个人和组织，在传播过程中，个人和组织的属性是可见的（DiMaggio and Poweel 1983；Djelic 1998）。实务的繁殖并不容易，存在很多难以逾越的困难，因此实务不能在互有联系的组织间无限制地传播（Czarniawska and Sevon 1996，2005）；尽管如此，实务在互有联系的组织间传播，还是会造成严重趋同和变异减少，特别是展现出某个属性的组织越多，那个属性被模仿的可能性就越大（Singh，Tucker，and House 1986；Carroll and Hannan 1989；Hannan 1998）。

简而言之，开发赶尽探索（March and Simons 1958，185；Holland 1975；March 1999c，第 7 章）。精练和模仿过程要想存活下去，似乎就要消灭产生新事物及其鼻祖的过程；面对精练和模仿过程的封杀，产生新事物和异质性的过程如何存活下去？新事物理论似乎必须回答这一问题（Van de Ven 1999；Nooteboom 2000）。

### 4.2 新事物之谜

THE NOVELTY PUZZLE

Novelty is vulnerable to adaptive processes. Yet new ideas and changes stemming from them, as well as heterogeneity in routines, practices, and forms, are conspicuous aspects of modern organizational experience. Although students of organizations often portray organizations as resistant to novelty and prone to mimetic homogeneity, a comparison of almost any organization as it functions today with the same organization fifty years ago reveals substantial differences, and contemporaneous heterogeneity among organizations is often considerable (Hoopes and Madsen 2008). Organizations are often difficult to change in any particular desired direction, and the complaints of organizational reformers pursuing a specific reform are, therefore, undoubtedly justified. However, organizational change is frequent (March 1999c, chap. 8), and proposals of organizational change are even more frequent. The babble of proposed change is loud and continuous.

Although not all change involves the introduction of novel ideas, novelty is remarkably common. Deviant behaviors and practices are generated at a significant rate more or less continually. Most novel ideas are quickly and beneficially extinguished, but for some reason, this does not seem to slow the flow of novelty. The ultimate destiny of an evolving human species in an evolving universe may, in some sense, be a novelty-free existence, but adaptive processes seem likely to eliminate the species long before they eliminate novelty. Novelty appears in many respects to be irrepressible.

The failure of adaptive processes to eliminate foolishness, curiosity, deviance, and the processes of novelty is a puzzle. How do the mechanisms of novelty generation — whatever they may be — survive and reproduce (Dosi 1988; Dosi, Marengo, Bassanini, and Valente 1999; Gigerenzer 2000; Olsen 2009)? If most novel practices, products, or ideas diminish the chances of success — as seems almost axiomatic — what sustains mechanisms of novelty?

One might imagine that mechanisms of novelty survive despite their poor short-run and nearby returns by virtue of their more distant adaptive usefulness. One version of such an imagination is the speculation that the human organism is hardwired to foster novelty through a curiosity drive or other similar attribute that has evolved over thousands of generations. Such a speculation is, however, more a proclamation of faith than a certifiable phenomenon, and students of adaptive processes are generally reluctant to assume adaptive magic without understanding the specific way in which it has been accomplished.

It is possible to specify situations in which attributes that are locally suboptimal but more useful in the long run or over a broader perspective survive over time; but it is also possible to specify environments in which attributes essential to long-run survival, such as novelty or diversity, make survival in the short run difficult or impossible, and attributes that permit short-run survival are deleterious in the long run. There is no necessary solution to the problem of meeting both nearby and more distant survival requirements, and the precise mechanisms involved have to be identified.

The problem is complicated by the undoubted role of exploitative knowledge in the development and execution of novel ideas. Many studies of creativity identify the creative tension between processes of imagination and processes of execution, recognizing the extent to which the foolishness of exploration has to be juxtaposed to the discipline of exploitation. Either alone is not enough. It is usually argued, however, that the relation has to evolve in such a way that the ratio of imagination to the discipline of conventional knowledge is high relatively early in any particular project and declines over time. The usual concern is that the ratio tends to decline more rapidly than is desirable and thus that novel ideas are normalized too quickly.

在适应过程面前，新事物不堪一击。然而，新想法及其带来的变化，还有程序、实务和形式的异质性，是现代组织经验的显著方面。尽管组织学者经常把组织描述成抵制新事物、容易因为模仿而变得千篇一律的样子，但是，随便找一家组织，拿它现在的样子与 50 年前的样子比较一下，就会发现很大的不同，而且，同一时代的不同组织，彼此之间也存在很大的差别（Hoopes and Madsen 2008）。组织往往很难朝预设的方向改变，因此，组织变革家对「变革难」的抱怨无疑是有道理的。然而，组织经常发生变化（March 1999c，第 8 章），变革建议更常被人提出。提议变革的声音恢宏响亮、从未间断。

尽管并非所有的变革都涉及引入新想法，但是新事物是十分常见的。不合常规的行为和实务一直在源源不断地出现。大多数新想法被迅速而明智地消灭掉了，但是出于某种原因，新事物还是源源不断地出现。在不断进化的宇宙中，不断进化的人类的最终命运也许是 —— 在某种意义上 —— 没有新事物的存在，但是适应过程似乎会在消灭新事物之前就早早地消灭人类。从很多方面来说，新事物的出现是势不可挡的。

适应过程为什么并未消灭愚蠢、好奇、异端和新事物产生过程？这是一个谜。新事物产生机制 —— 不管到底为何 —— 是如何生存繁衍的（Dosi 1988；Dosi，Marengo，Bassanini，and Valente 1999；Gigerenzer 2000；Olsen 2009）？如果大多数新实务、新产品或新想法几乎没有成功机会 —— 这一点似乎近似公理 —— 那么新事物产生机制依靠什么生存下去？

有人也许认为，新事物产生机制尽管短期、局部结果差，但是对长期、整体适应有用，所以能够存活下来。这种构想的一个版本是，人类有机体先天就会在好奇心（或者其他经过数千代进化形成的类似属性）的驱动下培育新事物。然而，这样的构想更像一个公开宣称的信仰，而非一个可以证实的现象。而且，适应学者一般不愿假定适应具有神奇魔力，他们更愿弄清适应的具体过程。

在有些情境下，对局部而言是次优的属性，却有利于长期生存或整体生存；在有些情境下，有利于长期生存的属性，比如新事物或多样性，却会让短期生存困难重重或者根本不可能，而允许短期生存的属性却会损害长期生存。如何既满足短期生存要求又满足长期生存要求？这一问题没有定解，其中到底涉及什么机制需要进一步研究加以确认。

在形成与实施新想法的过程中，无疑要用到已有知识，这让以上问题变得更加复杂。很多创造力研究发现，构思过程与实施过程之间存在创造性冲突，这些研究还认识到探索与开发必须并驾齐驱，单单哪一个都是不够的。然而，经常有人认为，探索与开发的演化方式必须是探索与开发之比起初要高，后来要越变越低，在任何一个项目中都是如此。通常的担忧是探索与开发之比倾向于过快降低，新想法因此过快被标准化。

### 4.3 理解新事物的两条理论思路

TWO THEORETICAL TRACKS FOR UNDERSTANDING NOVELTY

Novelty is a conspicuous feature of organization life, so any simple idea that the adaptive efficiencies coded into knowledge and adaptive processes are homogeneously inimical to the generation of novelty or the reproduction of novelty-generating mechanisms is probably incomplete. In attempting to understand the survival of novelty in the face of adaptive mechanisms that seem likely to extinguish it, students of adaptation have developed theories of novelty along two main tracks, each of which offers insight but neither of which has led to a strikingly satisfactory resolution.

新事物是组织生活的显著特征，因此，不管什么观点，只要简单地认为所有适应效益（编码成了知识）和适应过程无一例外都不利于新想法的产生或者新想法产生机制的繁殖，那就十有八九是片面的。为了理解新想法如何在似乎很有可能灭绝新想法的适应机制面前存活下去，适应学者沿着两大思路发展理论，每条思路都带来了有用的见解，但都没带来令人十分满意的答案。

#### 4.3.1 适应结合

Adaptive Combinations

The first track postulates some kind of process by which new elements are produced from combinations of established old ones. The classic example in evolutionary biology is sexual reproduction and the genetic combinations that it produces. The classic example in organizational studies is the transfer of rules, routines, or practices from one location to another and the transformations that they experience as they combine with existing rules, routines, and practices within the receiving organization (Czarniawska and Sevón 1996, 2005; Zbaracki 1998). The search for a theory of the combinatorics of organizational routines has occupied many good people for many years. Progenitors of the ideas are found in economics (Schumpeter 1934), psychology (Hebb 1949), and political science (Deutsch 1963).

The combinatoric tradition has numerous contemporary contributors (Padgett and Ansell 1983; Feldman 1989, 2000; Pentland and Rueter 1994; Romer 1994; Pentland 1995; Cohen and Sproull 1996; Czarniawska and Joerges 1996; Weitzman 1998; Gilboa and Schmeidler 2001; Feldman and Pentland 2003; Nooteboom 2000; Padgett, Lee, and Collier 2003; Gavetti, Levinthal, and Rivkin 2005; Obstfeld 2005; Padgett and McLean 2006; Becker, Knudsen, and March 2006; Gavetti and Warglien 2007; Page 2007; Svejenova, Mazza, and Planellas 2007; Nooteboom and Stam 2008).

The hunt for analogues has wandered from Mendel to linguistics to literary theory to haute cuisine to chemistry to neural networks with inconclusive but instructive results. The classic problems, particularly in theories of organizational novelty, are specifying precisely the basic elements involved, the laws of combination, and the ways in which those laws have evolved. Although elements of such a theory have been sketched in interesting ways, none of these problems has been solved in a way that is totally satisfactory. Nothing analogous to Mendelian laws exists for the theory of combinatoric novelty in organizations.

第一条思路假定存在某种过程，老元素相互结合产生新元素。进化生物学中的经典例子是，有性繁殖产生基因结合体。组织研究中的经典例子是，规则、程序或实务从一个地方传播到另外一个地方，与那个地方已有的规则、程序或实务互相结合（Czarniawska and Sevon 1996，2005；Zbaracki 1998）。多年以来，很多优秀学者一直在寻找组织程序结合理论。结合思想的鼻祖可以在经济学（Schumpeter 1934）、心理学（Hebb 1949）和政治学（Deutsch 1963）中找到。

当代有很多学者为结合学说做出了贡献（Padgett and Ansell 1983；Feldman 1989，2000；Pentland and Rueter 1994；Romer 1994；Pentland 1995；Cohen and Sproull 1996；Czarniawska and Joerges 1996；Weitzman 1998；Giboa and Schmeidler 2001；Feldman and Pentland 2003；Nooteboom 2000；Padgett，Lee，and Collier 2003；Gavetti，Levinthal，and Rivkin 2005；Obstfeld 2005；Padgett and Mclean 2006；Becker，Knudsen，andMarch 2006；Gavetti and Warglien 2007；Page 2007；Svejenova，Mazza，and Planellas 2007；Nooteboom and Stam 2008）。

遗传学、语言学、文学理论、烹饪学、化学、神经网络学也在寻找结合理论，得到了一些不是定论但有启发性的结果。经典问题是，特别是在组织新事物理论中，具体指出涉及哪些基本元素、结合法则，还要具体指出结合法则如何演化。尽管有人用各种有趣的方式勾勒出这种理论的雏形，但是以上问题没有得到令人完全满意的解决。目前为止，还没有像遗传法则那样详尽的组织程序结合理论。

#### 4.3.2 适应低效

Adaptive Inefficiency

The second track of theories of novelty proceeds from the implicit assumption that processes of adaptation eliminate sources of error but are inefficient in doing so. Casual observations of human life suggest that existing mechanisms of adaptation are far from perfect. The modern social order is an impressively effective system of social control, but it is persistently subject to the contradictions of deviant actors, not all of whom spend years in prisons or asylums. Markets, particularly financial markets, enforce many elements of efficient adaptation, but they leave ample room for wonder at their inefficiencies. Successful gambling casinos and lotteries are monuments to human capabilities to make investment choices that reduce their prospects for wealth accumulation.

The propensity of managers in organizations to be similarly inattentive both to what is known and to evidence about what might come to be known is legendary (Pfeffer and Sutton 2006; Gary, Dosi, and Lovallo 2008), as is the failure of organizations to adopt practices reputed to have led to successes elsewhere. A common interpretation of such elements of apparent maladaptation emphasizes the relatively slow character of adaptive processes relative to the rate of change of the environments they encounter, but such an explanation suffers from the flexibility in estimating the rates of change that it allows.

At least at first blush, it appears that novelty survives not because it offers selective advantage within specifiable adaptive mechanisms but because those mechanisms are actually quite inefficient instruments of improvement and thus inefficient in eliminating the instruments of novelty. They move slowly, and they make mistakes. They have difficulty achieving unity and coherence. As a result, organizations exhibit a rich mixture of continuity and change (Olsen 2009). For example, in an organizational setting, personnel retention procedures that retain apparently successful managers and dismiss apparently unsuccessful managers seem prima facie to be useful in improving the fit of an organization to its environment; yet they can systematically retain less competent managers and dismiss the more competent, thus both tolerating foolish novelty and reducing the long-run fit (March and March 1977; Levinthal 1991; Denrell and Fang 2007).

新事物理论的第二条思路，起点是一个内隐的假设：适应过程是想消灭错误源，但是这样做的效率并不高。随便观察一下人类生活就会发现，现有的各种适应机制远远称不上完美。现代社会秩序是十分有效的社会控制系统，但是总会遇到与之对抗的越轨行动者，而并非所有越轨行动者都会被关进监狱或者精神病院。市场机制，特别是金融市场机制，是高效的适应机制，但也有低效的成分。博彩业繁荣昌盛，说明人类有能力做出让财富积累前景变暗的投资选择。

前面说过，组织学者非常感兴趣的一个问题是，为什么在某公司带来成功的做法被搬到其他公司后并不一定能带来成功？组织学者同样非常感兴趣的另外一个问题是，为什么组织管理者倾向于既不关注已知之物又不关注有证据显示即将出现的新事物（Pfeffer and Sutton 2006；Gary，Dosi，and Lovallo 2008）。对这种表面上的适应不良的一个常见解释强调，相对于环境变化速度而言，适应过程是比较缓慢的，但是这样的解释有一个缺陷：不能具体指出适应过程允许环境以多快速度变化。

至少乍看之下，在叫得出名的那些适应机制之下，新事物之所以存活，好像不是因为新事物具有天择优势，而是因为那些适应机制改进已知之物的效率低下，进而消灭新事物的效率低下。速度慢，易出错，很难实现统一和连贯。结果，在组织之中，延续与变化这对矛盾纠缠紧密（Olsen 2009）。例如，在组织背景下，人力资源政策留下表面成功的管理者、解雇表面失败的管理者，乍看似乎对提高组织与环境的匹配度有用；然而，系统而言，人力资源政策也会留下比较无能的管理者、解雇比较能干的管理者，进而既容忍愚蠢的新事物又降低长期匹配度（March and March 1977；Levinthal 1991；Denrell and Fang 2007）。

#### 4.4.3 笼统标签

Generic Labels

One conventional approach to talking about adaptive inefficiency is to provide a generic label for inexplicable deviations: stupidity? madness? revelation? genius? perversity? irreducible noise? The obvious analogue is the concept of mutation, a label for inexplicable deviations in genetic reproduction. Providing such labels is not an entirely foolish solution. Most natural processes or understandings of them exhibit inexplicable variation, and almost every domain of knowledge has labels for its unexplained variance: personality, power, leadership, culture. Since in social science generally, as in theories of adaptation, the unexplained variance is large, the concepts specified by such labels account for a great deal without explaining it (Lave and March 1975).

Such labeling is a kind of intellectual last resort that can be justified primarily by the extent to which it stimulates scholarship that reduces the use of the label. For example, some years ago, the label of「risk preference」was introduced into choice theory as a generic label for observed nonlinearities in the revealed human utility for money over alternative gambles and thus for unexplained deviations from predicted behavior. This led to considerable effort to unpack the nonlinearities, an effort that has sometimes been confused by the label but that has, on balance, probably been fruitful (March and Shapira 1987, 1992; March 1999c, chap. 15; Denrell 2007, 2008).

谈论适应低效的一种通俗做法就是给解释不了的不合常规的现象贴上笼统标签：愚蠢？疯狂？意外？天才？反常？不能消减的噪声？进化学中最显而易见的例子是突变概念，这是为基因繁殖中的不合常规的现象贴上的标签。贴这样的标签，并不是十分愚蠢的解决办法。大多数自然过程或对自然过程的理解会展现一些解释不了的变异，几乎每个知识领域都为其解释不了的变异贴标签：人格、权力、领导力、文化。既然社会科学中解释不了的变异一般都很大（就像适应理论中的一样），那么只要贴上这样的标签，不对标签指代的概念做出诠释，就能解释很大一部分变异（Lave and Mach 1975）。

贴这样的标签，是学者的最后一招。这种做法的存在价值就是，刺激学术发展，进而让人们少使用这样的标签。例如，几年前，「风险偏好」被人引入选择理论，作为金钱效用曲线的任何非线性特征的笼统标签。之后，大量试图解密金钱效用非线性特征的研究纷纷涌现，其中有些研究因为「风险偏好」这个标签而显得混乱，但是总体来说，这些研究带来了很多有价值的发现（March and Shapira 1987，1992；March 1999c，第 15 章；Denrell 2007，2008）。

### 4.4 新事物生成机制的存活

THE SURVIVAL OF MECHANISMS OF NOVELTY

An alternative to providing a catchall label for instances of novelty is to try to identify specific processes that generate unavoidable but predictable mistakes of adaptation. For example, we can imagine a theory of knowledge decay. Knowledge can be assumed to be accumulated through adaptation and stored in libraries, genes, rules, and memories. Knowledge is lost through turnover, forgetting, and misfiling, which assure that at any point there is considerable ignorance. Something that was once known is no longer known. In addition, knowledge is lost through its incomplete accessibility. Something that is known at one place is unknown at another (Jeppesen and Lakhani 2009).

Ignorance, whether from lags in adaptation, from decay, or from failure to access distributed knowledge, ordinarily is more likely to produce disaster than useful discovery; but sometimes it can generate the latter (Polanyi 1963). It is one of the reasons to be cautious in seeking to produce fully integrated, efficient systems of knowledge (Burt 1987). Betterarticulated theories both of knowledge decay and of the peculiarities of access to distributed knowledge would almost certainly contribute to a better understanding of organizational novelty.

不给新事物贴笼统标签，就要尽力明确具体是什么过程在产生不可避免但可以预测的适应错误。例如，我们可以构想一个知识衰退理论。我们可以假定，知识通过适应而积累，储存在图书馆、基因、规则和记忆中。知识通过更迭、遗忘和错误归档而丢失，这样，不管什么时候都有很大程度的无知。有的东西，以前知道，现在不知道。另外，知识还通过其不完全可及性而丢失。有的东西，这个地方知道，那个地方不知道（Jeppesen and Lakhani 2009）。

无知，不管是适应滞后还是知识衰退或者是不能获取分布式知识引起的，一般更可能带来灾难而非有用的发现（Polanyi 1963）。这就是在力求打造整合全、效率高的知识系统时要小心谨慎的原因之一（Burt 1987）。不管是知识衰退理论，还是分布式知识可及性理论，只要阐述得当，几乎肯定会促进对组织新事物的理解。

Novelty as Deviance

A conspicuous feature of novelty is that it deviates from received knowledge or norms, and a more general theory of deviance from conventionality might, therefore, illuminate a theory of novelty (Amabile 1983; Wells et al. 2006). One variant of a theory of deviance highlights the speculation that the deviants of creativity may share important attributes with the deviants from sanity and social norms. By this presumption, the correlates of genius will overlap considerably the correlates of delinquency. As a result, insofar as it focuses on individual-level explanations, a theory of novelty is likely to share many features with a theory of deviance. It is tempting to assume that creativity (i.e., novelty that turns out to change things) is simply a random draw from the universe of foolishness and thus that the primary nonrandom determinants of individual creativity are the determinants of deviance.

At least since Durkheim (1973), sociological theories of deviance have emphasized the way in which deviance is generated not by individual-level processes but by features of society. The strong association of criminal deviation with gender, race, and age attributes of individuals is pictured as stemming from properties of social structure: deviance stems from disassociation from well-integrated social institutions and norms. Alienation or separation from social institutions is created and sustained by the development of cultures of opposition and membership in deviant social groups (Becker 1963; Spergel 1964), by cultural typing (Said 1978), and by learning (Bandura 1977). Just as the innovative deviance of the juvenile delinquent (Becker 1984) is shaped by an imperfect relation with social institutions, norms, and instruments of control, so also perhaps is the innovative deviance of the entrepreneurial capitalist.

In order for a theory of deviance to contribute to a theory of novelty, however, it needs to explain how deviance fits into an adaptive system, how the inefficiencies of adaptation are inherent in its capabilities for producing successes. This is one way of perceiving the combinatorics of sexual reproduction among animals, or the combinatorics of the spread of ideas through a population of firms. Sexual reproduction generally produces combinations of genes that will be favored by the environment, but it also sometimes produces combinations that are exceptionally deviant. Most of these will fail miserably, but some small fraction will turn out to have attributes that are unusually favorable.

In an analogous fashion, the imitation of successful practices generally results in improved chances of survival, but it also can result in transformations that are exceptionally deviant. Again, most of these will fail miserably, but some small fraction will turn out to have attributes that are unusually favorable (Zbaracki 1998; Czarniawska and Sevón 2005). Similar things can be said about random interdisciplinary or cross-cultural interaction (March 2008, chap. 13). By embedding them in processes of efficient reproduction of favorable traits, selective adaptation preserves mechanisms for producing foolish novelty.

新事物的一个显著特征就是，不合常规，因此，新事物理论也许可以借鉴更为一般的越轨理论（Amabile 1983；Wells et al. 2006）越轨理论的一个版本强调一个揣测：创造中的越轨也许和偏离神智或者偏离社会规范的越轨具有很多重要的共同点。根据这一揣测，造就天才的因素应该在很大程度上与造就罪犯的因素重叠。结果，只要把解释焦点放在个体水平上，新事物理论就很有可能与越轨理论有很多共同点。有个假定很诱人，那就是，创造物（即最后被判定为成功的新事物）不过是从愚蠢总体中随机抽取的个体，因此，在个体水平上，影响创造行为的主要非随机因素也是影响越轨行为的因素。

至少自涂尔干（Durkheim 1973）以来，社会学越轨理论就一直在强调，越轨的产生与个体水平的因素无关，而与社会的特征有关。在社会学越轨理论看来，犯罪与性别、种族和年龄等个体属性的强相关，是由社会结构的性质造成的：越轨源自与周密完善的社会制度和社会规范的分裂。与社会制度疏离或隔离，其出现和持续可归因于敌对文化的发展和异常社会群体的成员身份（Becker 1963；Spergel 1964）、文化定型（Said 1978）、学习（Bandura 1977）。少年犯的离经叛道是由与社会制度、社会规范和社会控制的关系不良造成的（Becker 1984），企业资本家的离经叛道亦是如此。

然而，为了让越轨理论对新事物理论做出贡献，需要解释越轨是如何嵌入适应系统的，还需要解释适应的低效性是如何内生于其制造成功的能力的。这是认识动物有性繁殖的一种方式，也是认识事物在组织间传播的一种方式。有性繁殖一般会产出受环境接纳的基因结合，但有时也会产出特别出格的基因结合。这些基因结合，大部分会悲惨地失败，小部分最终会具有特别受环境接纳的属性。

类似的，模仿成功实务一般会加大存活机会，但是往往还会带来特别出格的转变。再次，这些转变，大部分会悲惨地失败，小部分最终会具有特别受环境接纳的属性（Zbaracki 1998；Czarniawska and Sevón 2005）。对于任意跨学科或跨文化交流而言，情况也是类似的（March 2008，第 13 章）。适应把新事物产生机制镶嵌在高效繁殖受环境接纳的属性的过程中，这样，新事物产生机制才得以保存下来。

#### 4.4.2 组织适应如何制造产生新事物的条件

Adaptive Generation of Conditions for Novelty in Organizations

Three ways in which effective adaptation in organizations creates conditions favorable to novelty generation, even though the return from such novelty may be negative, are well known in organizational studies (for a further discussion, see Miner, Haunschild, and Schwab 2003). The first is the way in which success leads to organizational slack and its associated reduction in control, which in turn yields experimentation and avoidance of the infant mortality of ideas (Cyert and March 1963; Nohria and Gulati 1996; Greve 2003). Among start-up firms, excess capital resources provide slack buffers that limit the infant mortality of novel ideas (Levinthal 1991). In effect, substantial success, either in performance or in soliciting early support, absorbs the negative effects of failure and reduces the close monitoring of idea initiatives. These slack buffers reflect uncommitted resources (Deutsch 1963) that facilitate the extended pursuit of untested ideas, some small fraction of which may turn out to be exceptionally good ones (Winter 1971). Slack is produced by efficiency, but it serves to protect foolishness from elimination. Novelty (which is likely to be mostly foolish) is a side consequence of slack, which is a side consequence of effective adaptation.

A second phenomenon of organizational adaptation that contributes to novelty is managerial hubris. Adaptive mechanisms retain successful managers at a higher rate than unsuccessful ones. A history of success leads managers to a systematic overestimation of the prospects for success in novel endeavors. If managers attribute their successes to talent when they are, in fact, a joint consequence of talent and good fortune, successful managers will come to believe that they have capabilities for beating the odds in the future as they apparently have had in the past. This hubris on the part of managers will lead them (and thereby their organizations) to be more supportive of novel risky ideas than the ideas warrant (March and Shapira 1987; Kahneman and Lovallo 1993). Novelty is a side consequence of managerial hubris about risk, which is a side consequence of adaptive managerial selection.

A third organizational feature contributing to novelty comes from the way competition among alternatives within or among organizations leads to overly optimistic hopes for novel ideas. In a competitive world of promises, winning projects are systematically projects in which hopes exceed reality (Wilson 1977; Harrison and March 1984; Thaler 1988). Novel ideas, by virtue of the lack of reliable knowledge about them, profit particularly from this tendency toward overoptimism. Competitive selection based on expectations for the future favors optimistic biases, which favor novelty because the uncertainty surrounding new things makes them more open to the enthusiasms of optimistic fantasy. A key U.S. government official involved in funding spy satellite systems noted that sixteen of the eighteen government space programs opened to competitive bidding between 1977 and 2002 were awarded to new players. He explained this as stemming from some combination of naiveté and guile:「You as the incumbent are probably going to write a realistic proposal because you know what’s involved and propose pretty much what you’ve been doing, since it has been successful. Your competitor, out of ignorance or guile, is going to write a more imaginative, creative proposal for which there is almost no backing」(Taubman 2007).

The mechanisms underlying organizational slack, managerial hubris, and competitive optimism are all instruments of adaptive effectiveness. They reflect and support success, but at the same time they contribute to novelty in organizations even though novelty is, on average, a bad idea. These apparent paradoxes lead to the speculation that there may be other ways in which adaptive processes help to sustain, rather than eliminate, novelty-generating mechanisms.

Consider, for example, the ways in which intelligence and knowledge are implicated in the reproductive errors of adaptation (March 2008, chap. 8). On the one hand, intelligence and knowledge generally seem more likely to eliminate novelty than to sustain it. Substantially novel ideas, routines, and properties are likely to deviate from established practices and knowledge. They will generally be identified as inferior to existing practice by conventional intelligence. In the overwhelming majority of cases, rejection of new ideas by the application of intelligence proves to be sensible. The result is the reinforcement of the use of intelligence and knowledge in taking action, as well as in assessing novel practices. Predilections for using knowledge and intelligence are learned from good experience with them. Since they (correctly) identify most novel ideas as inferior, knowledge and intelligence are often portrayed both as major engines of competitive advantage, change, and economic growth (Winter 1987; Hatchuel and Weil 1995; Loasby, 1999) and as major inhibitors of creativity (Simonton 1999; March 2008, chap. 8).

However, there is another side to intelligence, what might be called utopian intelligence. Enthusiasm for rational intelligence leads to enthusiasm for ideas generated from abstract thinking and models, stimulates faith in the fit of hypothetical models to real situations, and encourages confidence in novel alternatives generated by abstract thinking. This kind of utopian intelligence appears to be a major source of novel ideas and to have produced well-documented cases of significant change. As might be expected, however, most such novel inventions end in disaster, as they have generally in the history of utopian idealists. Consider, for example, the role of utopian intelligence in the central planning of the Soviet Union and its Eastern European satellites, the American adventure in Vietnam, and the burst bubble of Long-Term Capital Management.

With such a record of disasters, even the crudest kind of adaptive process might be expected to extinguish the use of utopian intelligence. How does it happen, then, that utopian intelligence is reproduced in human communities? A possible answer (borrowed from population biology) is the idea of hitchhiking (Hedrick 1982). A property that is neutral or harmful survives by virtue of its linkage to a selectively advantageous property. An attribute (utopian intelligence) that almost always fails hitchhikes on an attribute (routine intelligence) that is frequently and manifestly successful.

The notion that mechanisms of novelty generation survive by hitchhiking on mechanisms of routine efficiency has appeal as an interpretation of one way in which an adaptive process might sustain novelty, but it leaves the conditions for hitchhiking unexplained. What links utopian intelligence with routine intelligence so that the hitchhiking occurs? The obvious (but not particularly helpful) answer is that the two elements of intelligence are linked cognitively and socially to such a degree that they cannot easily be unbundled. They share so many basic elements that an adaptive advantage of one necessarily results in an adaptive advantage for the other. For example, the two elements of intelligence are deeply intertwined in education so that success using one is highly correlated with success using another.

Hitchhiking as used in such an explication, however, is little more than an arm-wave reminder of adaptive inefficiencies. The intuitive idea is that mechanisms of adaptation create a dynamic of novelty that, despite its propensity to disaster, is shielded from elimination by the adaptive process itself. Developing that intuitive idea into something more precise requires a close empirical look at cases of novelty generation from the point of view of understanding how they survive their errors. The hitchhiking relation between routine intelligence and utopian intelligence provides a minimal specification of the mechanism, but it is only slightly less mysterious than the intuitive idea itself.

What other linkages exist that bundle organizational attributes so that it is difficult to separate their adaptive fates? An obvious feature of historical causality is its complexity. As the causal complexity of the bundling of organizational attributes increases, the amount of adaptive experience required to guarantee that adaptive processes will reliably reproduce only superior attributes becomes much larger than organizational experience can be expected to be. Under such conditions, novelty becomes not so much an anomaly of adaptation as a product of it, and a theory of novelty becomes a theory of the mechanisms of inherent adaptive inefficiency.

The problem is to move from a general proposition that the causal complexity of history sustains instruments of adaptive inefficiency from which elements of novelty arise to a more precise specification of individual mechanisms. Such a move will probably require two interrelated things. The first is empirical — an intense multiobservation focus over some time, a strategy that is probably more akin to the story of Mendelian research than to the story of Schumpeterian imagination. The second is theoretical — the development of a handful of precise ideas that clarify the phenomena that have been observed. Neither can proceed very far without the other, but it is particularly difficult to choose among quite different theoretical analogues without a precise linkage with empirical observations. For example, an argument that organizational development is akin to language development is prima facie reasonable, but it cannot really be assessed relative to arguments that organizational development is analogous to species development or chemical bonding without both precise specifications and careful comparisons of the alternatives with multiple empirical cases.

在组织中，高效适应通过三种方式制造有利于新事物产生的条件（想进一步了解这个问题，请看 Miner，Haunschild，and Schwab 2003）。第一个是，成功带来组织宽裕（organizational slack）以及与之相连的控制减弱，进而鼓励尝试、避免新想法早夭（Cyert and March 1963；Nohria and Gulati 1996；Greve 2003）。在创业型公司，资本过剩，宽裕出现，新想法早夭可能性减小（Levinthal 1991）。实际上，巨大成功，不管是开业之后经营方面的还是开业之前筹备方面的，会吸收失败的负面效应，减少对创新活动的严密监控。这些宽裕缓冲机制反映着未支配的资源（Deutsch 1963），而未支配的资源会鼓励人们追求未经经验的想法，而小部分未经经验的想法也许结果会被证明是特别好的想法（Winter 1971）。宽裕是由高效制造的，但是宽裕有助于保护愚蠢使其免遭消灭。新事物（大部分新事物都是愚蠢的）是宽裕的副产品，而宽裕是高效适应的副产品。

第二个有利于新事物产生的组织适应现象是，管理者狂妄自大（managerial hubris）。适应机制以比失败管理者更高的比例留下成功管理者。成功史导致管理者系统地高估创新活动的成功前景。在成功是能力和运气联合产物的情况下把成功归因于能力，成功的管理者就会渐渐相信自己有能力在未来反败为胜，就像过去表明的那样。管理者的这种狂妄自大会导致他们（进而他们的组织）过分支持有风险的新想法（March and Shapira 1987；Kahneman and Lovallo 1993）。新事物是管理者狂妄自大的副产品，而管理者狂妄自大是高效选拔管理者的副产品。

第三个有利于新事物产生的组织适应现象是，对新想法过度乐观（overly Optimistic hopes for novel ideas）。系统而言，在一个竞相承诺的世界，获胜的项目是那些希望压倒现实的项目（Wilson 1977；Harrisonand March 1984；Thaler 1988）。新想法因为不大为人了解，所以特别容易从这种过度乐观中获益。基于未来期望的竞择待见乐观偏见，而乐观偏见待见新事物，因为新事物的不确定性让新事物更容易陷入乐观主义幻想。美国一参与间谍卫星系统资金管理的政府要员指出，1977—2002 年，美国政府的 18 个公开招标宇航项目中，有 16 个落入新玩家手中。他解释说，这是无知和狡猾共同造成的：「你作为老玩家，十有八九会写出一份贴近实际的建议书，因为你做过，你了解，既然以前的项目很成功，那就仿照以前的项目写建议书吧。你的竞争对手，出于无知或者狡猾，会创造出一份几乎没有任何底子的建议书（Taubman 2007）。」

组织宽裕、管理者狂妄自大和对新想法过度乐观的深层机制是所有让适应具有有效性的东西。它们反映并支持成功，与此同时又有利于新事物的产生，即使新事物平均而言是坏的。这些明显的悖论让人不禁揣测，适应过程也许还有其他方法帮助供养而非消灭新事物产生机制。

例如，想想智慧和知识是如何蕴藏在可繁殖的适应错误中的（March 2008，第 8 章）。一方面，智慧和知识似乎更有可能消灭而非供养新事物。新想法、新程序和新属性十有八九不合常规。通俗智慧一般认为，新想法、新程序和新属性劣于老想法、老程序和老属性。在绝大多数案例中，运用智慧拒绝新想法事后都被证明是明智的。这一事实导致人们更可能运用智慧和知识采取行动、评价新实务。人们运用智慧和知识尝到了甜头，于是学会了偏爱运用智慧和知识。因为智慧和知识把大多数新想法正确判定为坏想法，所以经常被人说成既是竞争优势的主要来源、变革和经济增长的主要引擎（Winter 1987；Hatchuel and Weil 1995；Loasby 1999），又是创造力的主要扼杀者（Sim-onton 1999；March 2008，第 8 章）。

然而，智慧还有另一面，这一面也许可以叫作乌托邦智慧。因为迷恋理性智慧，于是迷恋抽象思维和模型产生的想法，信仰假设模型与现实情境的拟合，看好抽象思考产生的新事物。这种乌托邦智慧似乎是新想法的主要源泉，而且，乌托邦智慧引发剧变的案例比比皆是、有据可考。然而，正如可能预料的那样，这样的新发明，大多以灾难告终，就像空想家的结局一般都很悲惨一样。例如，想想乌托邦智慧在苏联及其东欧卫星国计划经济中的作用，在美国对越战争中的作用，在美国长期资本管理公司（Long-Term Capital Management）泡沫破灭中的作用。

从这些灾难中可以看出，连最粗糙的适应过程也理应灭绝乌托邦智慧的运用。那么，乌托邦智慧是如何在人类共同体中繁殖的？一个可能的答案（借自种群生物学）是搭乘（hitchhiking）（Hedrick 1982）。中性或有害属性因为与有益属性相连而存活。一个几乎总是失败的属性（乌托邦智慧）搭乘一个经常而且明显成功的属性（常规智慧）。

新事物产生机制因为搭乘常规效率而存活，这一理念对于解释适应过程如何供养新事物而言是有吸引力的，不过，这一理念没有指出搭乘的具体条件。乌托邦智慧与常规智慧到底有什么联系才出现搭乘？显而易见的（但并非特别有用的）答案是，两者在认知上、社会上紧密相连、无法轻易分开。两者共享很多基本元素，适应过程接纳其中一个必然导致适应过程接纳另一个。例如，两者在教育中紧密交织，因此成功使用这一个与成功使用那一个高度相关。

然而，用搭乘来解释，不过是提醒人们适应的低效性。直觉想法是，适应机制创造了一种新事物相互作用机制，在这种机制之下，新事物尽管容易导致灾难，但是可以逃过适应过程的封杀。要丰富那个直觉想法，就要做实证研究，密切考察新事物产生案例，弄清新事物如何在屡屡出错的情况下存活下来。说乌托邦智慧与常规智慧之间存在搭乘关系，只是对新事物相互作用机制进行非常粗略的说明；搭乘想法只比那个直觉想法多走了很小一步。

还存在其他什么联系，把组织的众多属性捆绑在一起，让它们的适应命运难解难分？历史的因果结构有一个显而易见的特征，那就是复杂性。要保证适应过程可靠地只复制优良属性，就要积累一定量的经验。随着捆绑在一起的属性之间的因果结构越来越复杂，这个经验量会越来越大，最后远远超过组织能够提供的经验量。在这样的条件下，与其说新事物是适应的怪胎，不如说新事物是适应的产品，而且，要解释为何新事物能逃过适应的封杀，就要解释为何适应具有内在的低效性。

问题就从「适应的低效性产生新事物，历史的因果复杂性供养适应的低效性」这个一般命题变成对各个机制进行更为精确的说明。这样的转变也许需要做两件相关的事情。第一件是实证研究 —— 通过调查或实验反复观察一段时间，就像孟德尔做豌豆杂交实验一样。第二件是理论研究 —— 形成一组精确的观念，来阐明观察到的现象，就像熊彼特（Schumpeterian）构想创新理论一样。两者相辅相成，谁缺了谁都走不长远，特别是，没有实证观察作为精确依据，就很难决定到底在多种多样可供借鉴的理论中选择哪一个。例如，有人主张，组织发展类似于语言发展，这一主张乍看是合理的。不过，这一主张之外，还有其他主张，比如组织发展类似于物种发展，或者组织发展类似于化学键结。不对各个主张进行精确的说明，也没有多起实证案例可供参考的话，就很难评价各个主张的相对合理性。

### 4.5 新事物工程学

THE ENGINEERING OF NOVELTY

Organizational and social engineers seek ideas about possible organization forms or governmental procedures that might affect the rate of novelty or the success rate of novelty (Nooteboom and Stam 2008). One obvious possibility that has attracted considerable effort is to find early ways to distinguish the rare novel idea that will prove very successful from the numerous novel ideas that will be unsuccessful, even disastrous. The evidence does not support great optimism on this score, particularly with respect to extremely deviant ideas. New ideas that subsequently have changed knowledge considerably have usually been disparaged initially (Aronson 1977; David 1991). Strategies for distinguishing creativity from foolishness ordinarily impose criteria of conventionality that are more likely to reduce novelty than to purify it usefully. As Marc Andreessen, one of the founders of Netscape, said in an interview (Levy 2003),「Fundamental change comes out of left field. It has to be an idea that’s viewed as crazy at the time. If any idea looks like a good idea, there are lots of big companies out there like Microsoft that would already be doing it」(E10).

A more promising alternative is to seek ways to minimize the costs of experimenting with new ideas while retaining the benefits of successful ones (Romano 2002; Holahan, Weil, and Wiener 2003). Organizational engineering seeks forms of organizational foolishness that are protected enough to generate modest amounts of novelty without being so favored as to swamp an organization with novel, but inferior, possibilities. However, devising structures or procedures that protect an organization from the costs of deviance without also inhibiting the recognition and implementation of the occasional good idea is not easy (Cohen and Levinthal 1989, 1990). A classic solution is to limit the「bet size」of investments in novelty. The idea is to differentiate among novel ideas by smallscale experiments and to recoup the costs (including the losses associated with bad ideas) by subsequently increasing the investments in successful projects (Brown and Eisenhardt 1995; McGrath 1999).

The strategy of limiting exploratory bet size has achieved a certain amount of popularity (Sitkin 1992; Bowman and Hurry 1993); it has also generated a certain amount of skepticism (Adner and Levinthal 2004). There are obvious difficulties involved in scaling up from small experiments to large programs, but where that is possible, the strategy seems potentially feasible. It is, for example, one view of the plethora of entrepreneurial start-ups found during the heyday of Silicon Valley experimentation. Not by intentional design but primarily by happenstance, the high-tech community stumbled on a financial structure that, at least in the short run, seemed to separate the impact of the costs of experimentation from the realization of its benefits and allowed investors in the occasional spectacular success to bear the fruits of that success without fully paying the costs of the large number of failures.

Another set of strategies involves partitioning an organization into diverse subgroups. For example, a standard idea in discussions of combinatorics as a source of novelty is the advantage of diversity in routines for producing instances of advantageous novelty through high-variance combinations of them (Mayr 1982; Potvin, Kraenzel, and Seutin 2001; Page 2007). Diversity in organizations tends to be reduced by the homogenizing tendencies of adaptation (BeecherMonas 2007), but it is maintained by boundaries that create what Nooteboom (2000) describes as「secluded niches.」Permeable boundaries and the parochialism they stimulate encourage homogenization within their limits but diversity across them. As a result, they can sustain both diversity and adequate contact to allow useful combinations (Krackhardt and Kilduff 1990; Oberoi 1994; March 2008, chap. 13).

The organizational problem is to maintain parochialism among subunits sufficient to sustain multiple disciplined knowledge systems but with cross-unit contact sufficient to share ideas and practices (Burt 1987; Galunic and Rodan 1998; Rodan and Galunic 2004; Fang, Lee, and Schilling, 2009). The optimum level of segregation is difficult to specify, involving as it does difficult trade-offs across space and time (March 1994, chap. 6). Any solution to this problem has to be sensitive to the technology and organization of contact, as is evidenced by contemporary discussions of the advantages and disadvantages of changing capabilities to access distributed knowledge (Powell, Koput, and SmithDoerr 1996; Rodan 2008).

Early experiments in strengthening links among disparate knowledge bases have led to remarkable discoveries of ideas and practices that have developed in previously isolated domains ( Jeppesen and Lakhani 2009). It seems possible, however, that a side consequence of improving knowledge diffusion might be to introduce elements of homogenization that limit the decentralized pursuit of unlikely ideas. The history of organizational cycling between centralization and decentralization is a tribute, in part, to the engineering difficulty of finding an enduring balance between the short-run and local costs and the long-run and more global benefits of boundaries.

组织工程师和社会工程师在寻找也许可以影响新事物存活率或者成功率的组织形式和政府流程（Noote-boom and Stam 2008）。一个显而易见的策略，也是工程师投入大量努力的一个策略，就是想办法从大量的新想法中尽早分辨出稀有的好想法。但是，相关证据表明，这个策略没有多大前途，特别是对极其不合常规的想法而言。后来让世人大大改变认识的新想法，一般最初是遭人诽谤的（Aronson 1977；David 1991）。为了从愚蠢中分辨出创造，人们一般使用因循标准，而这个标准更可能减少新事物而非净化新事物（留下好的、筛掉坏的）。美国网景公司（Netscape）创始人之一马克·安德森（Marc Andreessen）在一次访谈中说（Levy 2003）：「根本变革始自离经叛道。引发根本变革的想法，必须最初在世人眼中是疯狂的。如果哪个想法看起来不错，那么一定有很多诸如微软之类的大公司已经在实施了。」（E10）

另外一个比较有前途的策略是，想办法在不损害好想法之收益的前提下降低尝试新想法的成本（Romano 2002；Holahan，Weil，and Wiener 2003）。组织工程学试图弄清，哪些形式的组织愚蠢，如果得到足够的保护，就会产生适量的新事物 —— 请注意是适量的，因为很多形式的组织愚蠢，如果受到接纳，就会让组织充满很有可能是坏想法的新想法。然而，让组织不至于被尝试拖垮又不至于识别不出更谈不上实施偶尔的好想法，这样的组织结构或组织流程很难设计出来（Cohen and Levinthal 1989，1990）。一个经典的解决方案是限制新事物投资的「赌注大小」，其思路是，进行小规模试验粗略评价新想法的好坏，随后增加初步被判断为成功的新想法的投资，达到节约成本（包括避免与坏想法相连的损失）的目的（Brown and Eisenhardt 1995；McGrath 1999）。

这个限制探索赌注大小的策略获得了一些认可（Sitkin 1992；Bowman and Hurry 1993），也招致了一些怀疑（Adner and Levinthal 2004）。小规模试验转化成大规模实施，中间还是存在很多显而易见的困难，但是只要有可能转化，这个策略还是非常可行的。例如，在硅谷试验全盛期，创业型公司多如牛毛，硅谷高科技园碰巧找到（并非有意设计）了一种财务结构，这个财务结构，至少短期之内，似乎能把试验成本的影响与实现收益隔离开来，进而允许押到宝的投资者摘取胜利果实但不承担大量失败的全部成本。

其他策略包括把组织划分成多种多样的部门（比如，事业部）。例如，前面提到的结合学说有一个基本观点，制造一些五花八门的结合体，里面总有一个有用的（Mayr 1982；Potvin，Kraenzel，and Seutin 2001；Page 2007）。前面提到的趋同效应倾向于减弱组织中的多样性（Beecher-Monas 2007），而制造「隔离利基 （secluded niches）」—— 诺特博姆（Nooteboom）（2000）提出的一个概念 —— 的边界倾向于维持组织的多样性。可渗透边界及其造成的本位主义鼓励局部同质化、整体多元化，因此既能维持多样性又能保证足够的联系，以制造有用的结合体（Krack-hardt and Kilduff1990；Oberoi 1994；March2008，第 13 章）。

组织的问题就是如何做到既维持足够强的本位主义，以供养多学科知识系统，又保证足够多的跨部门联系，以分享观念和事务（Burt 1987；Galunic and Rodan 1998；Rodan and Galunic 2004；Fang，Lee，and Schilling，2009）。最佳隔离程度很难指出，因为涉及跨时间、跨空间的权衡（March 1994，第 6 章）。这一问题的解决，不管使用什么方法，都要考虑联系技术和具体组织，正如当代有关「改变获取分布式知识的能力」这一做法有何优缺点的研究所证明的那样（Powell，Koput，and Smith-Doerr；Rodan 2008）。

早期有关加强不同知识库联系的实验，带来了一些了不起的发现，所发现的思想和实务，都是某个领域借鉴了另外一个原先与之隔离的领域（Jeppesen and Lakhani 2009）。然而，促进知识传播也许有一个副作用，那就是引入同质化，限制不同部门对不同想法的追求。在一定程度上，组织在集权与分权之间循环的历史就是一首歌，吟唱着「在边界的短期局部成本和长期整体收益之间寻找一个永久平衡」，这个工程是非常艰巨的。

## 0501. 经验的启示

THE LESSONS OF EXPERIENCE

Learning from experience in organizations is both an important phenomenon and a large industry. Business schools, publishers, publications, and consultants offer advice to business firms in parallel with an overlapping collection of schools, publishers, publications, and consultants specializing in public-sector organizations. To some extent, the groups flourish by equating improvement with learning, thus making the proposition that learning is a good thing into a tautology, but they provide ideas about how to achieve a「learning organization,」by which they mean an organization that uses mechanisms of learning to improve the return from actions. Some of the ideas come from research, some from experience, some from analysis, and some from various forms of personal imagination. They all seek to provide clues to improving organizational adaptiveness.

The efforts reflect a widespread belief that organizations need to improve their capabilities for comprehending and adapting to their environments (Argyris and Schön 1978; Etheredge 1985; Olsen and Peters 1996). The strategies for doing so include exploiting the learning found in academic theories of management and organization as translated and advocated by the purveyors of organizational advice. They also include developing capabilities for reacting intelligently to the lessons of direct experience. In this tradition, failures to improve intelligence through experience are due to human faults that are correctable through education and training.

The previous chapters have provided a few footnotes to those beliefs and efforts. They have explored some selected aspects of the possibilities, ambiguities, and problems of learning from experience. At the risk of using a few words to communicate what more words have already said, four general conclusions might be suggested.

• First, organizations and the people in them seek intelligence by modifying their expectations and understandings on the basis of the actions they take and the outcomes they observe. They learn both through low-intellect mechanisms that simply replicate successful actions, routines, or forms and also through high-intellect mechanisms that develop theories, models, and stories of history. Modifications in behaviors and understandings on the basis of experience are conspicuous aspects of human existence.

• Second, these mechanisms lead to palpable improvements in domains of relatively constrained activities that are repeated frequently. In such situations, the experience gained from repetitive practice frequently improves performance, although it ordinarily does not lead to an optimum, is subject to inadequate experimentation, and has limited generalizability.

• Third, in situations involving more complex causal relationships and fewer repetitions, experience is not a good teacher in the sense of reliably providing a clear basis for improvement in performance. However, in combination with the mythic themes provided by models and accepted story themes, the interpretation of experience develops conversational agreement, a sense of comprehension, a certification of the primacy of the human intellect, and (sometimes) a modicum of aesthetic achievement.

• Fourth, learning from experience requires experimentation for its long-run effectiveness but tends to extinguish it. Novelty is habitually vulnerable to effective learning. Nevertheless, novelty does arise in organizations and can, to a limited extent, be engineered.

组织从经验中学习，这既是一个重要的现象，又是一个庞大的产业。有很多商学院、出版商、出版物和顾问在向商业公司提建议，同时有很多商学院、出版商、出版物和顾问在专门研究公共部门的组织，而且，提建议和做研究的有很大一部分是重叠的。在某种程度上，那群人之所以事业兴旺，是因为他们把学习等同于改进，进而把「学习是个好东西」这个命题变成同义反复，但是他们就如何实现「学习型组织」—— 他们所说的「学习型组织」是指运用学习机制改进行动回报的组织 —— 献计献策。他们提出的计策，有些来自研究，有些来自经验，有些来自分析，有些来自各种各样的个人想象。他们都力求为提高组织的适应能力提供思路。

以上努力反映了一个普遍的信念：组织需要提高理解并适应环境的能力（Argyris and Schon 1978；Etheredge 1985；Olsen and Peters 1996）。这样做的策略包括，利用由组织咨询师翻译和推广的管理和组织学术理论描述的各种学习机制，还包括，培养对直接经验做出智慧反应的能力。相关的一个信念是，如果未能通过经验增长智慧，那就是因为学习者犯了错误，这些错误是可以通过教育和培训加以纠正的。

前面几章为那些信念和努力进行了注解，选择性地探讨了从经验中学习的潜力、模糊性和问题的几个方面。冒着用几句话总结前面诸多讨论的危险，这里提出四个一般结论：

第一，组织以及组织中的人采取行动、观察行动结果并据此调整期望和理解，以寻求智慧。其学习既采用低智机制，即简单地复制成功的行动、程序或形式，也采用高智机制，即建构有关历史的理论、模型、故事。根据经验调整行为和理解是人类存在的一个显著方面。

第二，在可以反复练习积累经验的、相对独立的、相对狭小的领域，以上机制可以带来明显的改进。在这样的领域，通过反复练习获得的经验，往往会改进绩效，不过一般不会带来最优解，易犯尝试不足的错误，可推广性也有限。

第三，在因果关系复杂、练习机会较少的领域，经验不是好的老师，因为不能可靠地为绩效改进提供清晰的依据。然而，与公认故事或模型提供的神话主题相结合后，经验诠释可以促成共识、营造理解感、肯定人类智慧的重要性，有时还会提供少量审美情趣。

第四，一方面，从经验中学习，要想发挥长期效果，就要进行大量尝试；另一方面，从经验中学习，倾向于灭绝尝试。新事物容易受到有效学习的打击。然而，组织中确实不断有新事物出现，组织能够对新事物的出现和成长进行程度有限的策划。

### 5.1 经验作为有用的老师

EXPERIENCE AS A USEFUL TEACHER

There is no question that individuals and organizations regularly and routinely learn from experience in the sense of modifying behavior and understandings on the basis of experience. What is less self-evident is whether the lessons so readily learned from experience reliably improve performance or the likelihood of survival.

Experience is a significant source of intelligence in relatively isolated, narrow domains of frequently exercised specialized capabilities. Many common repetitive situations involve concrete specific knowledge. They provide relatively clear signals, relatively low levels of noise, and relatively large samples — adequate information for valid inference and palpable learning. Gardeners learn about the growth of plants, and although direct experiential knowledge about gardening is likely to be filled with superstition and half truths if it is not supplemented with knowledge gleaned from systematic experiments, experienced farmers typically know more than novice ones.

In a similar way, organizations learn how to operate successfully in specific contexts in which they find themselves. That knowledge is likely to be limited in application and generality, but it represents the useful fruits of trial-and-error learning, imitation, and selection in narrow domains. In almost every kind of specialized human activity, experience effects are positive. Experience, however, is not a perfect teacher. The replication of success often results in improvement, but it is not a particularly good way of discovering the best among many alternatives.

Perhaps the best-known pieces of evidence for the value of experiential learning are found in studies of so-called learning curves (Argote and Epple 1990; Argote 1999; Argote and Todorova 2007). In a number of well-documented studies, the unit costs of producing products have been shown to decline at a decreasing rate with the cumulative number of units produced (i.e., with experience). The more widgets a factory has produced in the past, the lower the cost of producing the next widget. A classic example is the way increases in cumulative experience reduce the hours required to assemble an aircraft. Likewise, both the time required to complete surgical procedures and the number of complications from surgery have been found to decrease at a decreasing rate with experience (Pisano, Bohmer, and Edmondson 2001; Reagans, Argote, and Brooks 2005).

The rate of improvement varies substantially from one product/procedure or organization to another. Organizations also sometimes independently exhibit improvement at a decreasing rate with the passage of time, but those gains (perhaps attributable to technological improvement in the environment) are usually smaller. Although it is generally easier to observe experiential improvement in unit costs or productivity than it is to anticipate the parameters involved in advance or to specify observable adaptive processes that have clearly produced the results, unit costs decline with cumulative units produced across a relatively large number of production operations.

In a similar, but less documented, way, continuing relationships (e.g., partners, bosses/subordinates, vendors, competitors) and the development of technical or artistic skills involve repeated experiences in constrained settings that are marked by fairly reliable improvement over time. Signals are clear; noise levels are low; sample sizes of experience are substantial. Partners develop reputations that are relatively reliable. Practice usually improves technical performance; the capabilities of lovers, artists, and plumbers can normally be expected to increase with experience. Ignace Paderewski, the great pianist (and briefly in 1919 the prime minister of Poland and signatory to the Treaty of Versailles), is reputed to have replied to praise from Queen Victoria that described him as a genius by saying "Perhaps, but before that I was a drudge."

如果说从经验中学习就是根据经验调整行为和理解的话，那么毫无疑问，个人和组织经常从经验中学习。不那么毫无疑问的是，从经验中如此容易就挖出来的启示能否可靠地改进绩效或加大生存可能性。

在可以反复练习形成专门能力的、相对独立的、相对狭小的领域，经验是重要的智慧源泉。很多常见的重复性情境涉及具体的特殊知识，提供相对清晰的信号、相对低的噪声和相对大的样本 —— 为有效的推断和明显的学习提供充分的信息。园丁学习了解植物的生长情况，如果不辅以来自系统实验的知识，直接经验知识就有可能充满迷信思想和半真半假的陈述，尽管如此，有经验的园丁知道的东西一般比没有经验的园丁多。

类似的，组织学习如何在自身所处的特殊背景下成功地运营。那种知识的应用范围和推广范围可能有限，但是代表了在狭小领域试误、模仿和天择的有用成果。几乎对所有专门化的人类活动而言，经验的效应都是正面的。然而，经验并非完美的老师。复制成功往往会带来改进，但并不是一个特别好的从众多选项中发现最佳选项的方法。

也许，证明体验式学习之价值的最有名的证据，来自所谓的学习曲线研究（Argote and Epple 1990；Argote 1999；Argote and Todorova 2007）。很多证据充分的研究表明，生产某种产品，单位成本随着累积生产量的增加（即随着经验的积累）而降低。小饰品工厂过去生产的小饰品越多，生产下个小饰品耗费的成本就越低。一个经典例子是，装配一架飞机所需的时间随着经验的积累而减少。同样，手术耗费时间的长短、手术带来并发症的数目都随着经验的累积而减速降低（Pisano，Bohmer，and Edmondson 2001；Reagans，Argote，and Brooks 2005）。

产品 / 手术不同、组织不同，改进速度就有很大的不同。组织有时也会随着时间的推移展现出与经验无关的改进，但是那些改进（也许可以归因于环境中的技术改进）往往较小。一般而言，单位成本随着经验的积累而降低（或者说，生产率随着经验的积累而提高）的现象相对比较容易观察到，但是，这个现象涉及什么参数相对不太容易提前预测到，具体是什么可观察到的适应过程造成了这一现象也相对不太容易指出来，尽管如此，单位成本随着累积生产量的增加而降低的现象在很多行业的生产运营中都可以看到。

类似的，但证据没那么充分的是，建立和维护长期关系（例如，合作伙伴、上司 / 下属、供应商、竞争者），培养技术技能（例如，疏通水道、修理钟表）或者艺术技能（例如，弹琴、绘画），都涉及在熟能生巧的独立狭小领域反复练习。信号清晰，噪声低，样本大。合作伙伴通过长时间真诚合作积累相对可靠的声誉。练习往往改进技能绩效；一般而言，可以期待爱人、艺术家、水管工的表现随着经验的增长而改进。据传，伟大的钢琴家伊格纳斯·帕德里维斯基（Ignace Paderewski）（1919 年做过很短一段时间的波兰首相，期间签署《凡尔赛条约》）在维多利亚女王（Queen Victoria）称赞他为天才时回答说：「也许，不过在那以前，我是个苦工。」

### 5.2 经验作为不完美的老师

EXPERIENCE AS AN IMPERFECT TEACHER

Despite its pervasiveness and the record of its successes, learning from experience faces numerous complications that limit its effectiveness. Underlying many of these complications are three conspicuous features of experience. The first is the vividness of experience; the second is the ambiguity of the lessons of experience; the third is the flexibility of interpretation.

从经验中学习，尽管非常普遍，也屡屡成功，但是有很多限制其效果的问题。这些问题，主要是由经验的三个显著特征造成的。第一个是经验的鲜活性，第二个是启示的模糊性，第三个是诠释的灵活性。

#### 5.2.1 经验的鲜活性

Vividness of Experience

Direct experience is exceptionally vivid to the individual or organization experiencing it (Fischhoff 1975). The vividness of direct experience leads learners to exaggerate the information content of personal experience relative to other information. There are good reasons why any particular organization or individual might weight direct experience somewhat more heavily than the experience of others. For example, direct experience requires no generalization to demonstrate its relevance to the organization or person to whom it has occurred. However, the salience and dramatic force of experience combine with its difficulty of interpretation to make attempting to learn from experience a significant source of error. As Mark Twain observed, a cat that jumps on a hot stove is likely never to jump on any stove (hot or cold) again. As a result, the cat is likely to fail to discover the pleasures of jumping on cold stoves.

Consciousness of the problem does not reliably lead to doubts about experiential learning. The good sense of limiting attention to direct experience is overcome by the emotional force of the apparent lessons to be gained from experience. Consider, for example, a surgeon forming estimates of the risks of a surgical procedure. He or she has available extensive studies of the mortality rates associated with particular procedures, as well as recollections from his or her own experience. Since the risks associated with a particular surgeon are to some extent idiosyncratic to that surgeon, reflecting among other things the surgeon’s skill, it is sensible for any particular surgeon to weigh direct experience somewhat more heavily than the individual experiences of other individuals; but the vividness of personal experience ordinarily results in its being weighted too heavily compared with the aggregate experiences of many individuals. Where the risks are extremely small, only a surgeon with considerable experience will accumulate a sample of procedures performed large enough to warrant any significant modification of the aggregate statistics. In particular, the skewed distribution of occurrences of a low-probability event assures that substantially more surgeons will have experiences better than the average than will have experiences worse than the average. They will come to believe that the risks are less than they are.

Direct experience is similarly misleading in personnel decisions. Consider the frequent use of personal presentations or personal interviews in making hiring decisions. Such direct experiences are systematically more compelling than is warranted by the information they contain, and thus they typically are given too much weight. As a result, personal presentations, such as job talks, are more likely to degrade than to improve the effectiveness of personnel decisions. The erratic but compelling impressions of personal exposure overwhelm information gathered in a more systematic, more valid, but less compelling way (Dawes, Faust, and Meehl 1989).

在个人和组织看来，直接经验特别鲜活（Fischhoff，1975）。直接经验的鲜活性导致学习者把来自直接经验的信息看得比来自其他渠道的信息重。个人和组织把直接经验看得比别人的经验重，理由是很充分的。例如，直接经验不需推广，就能与个人和组织扯上关系。然而，一方面，经验是那么鲜活；另一方面，经验又是那么不好诠释，所以从经验中学习特别容易出错。正如马克·吐温（Mark Twain）观察到的那样，一只偶然被热炉子烫过的猫绝不会再从任何炉子（不管是热的还是冷的）上方跳过，进而永远不会发现从冷炉子上方跳过是多么好玩。

意识到这一问题，并不一定就会怀疑体验式学习。把注意力局限在直接经验之上，有可能得到较好的判断；直接经验的表面启示，往往对人造成很大的震撼；后面这个震撼会降低前面那个可能性。例如，看看一位医生是如何形成对手术风险的估计的。他或她可以从别人发表的论文中、做出的报告中获得有关信息，也可以从自身的经验获得有关信息。既然一项手术的风险不仅和这项手术本身有关，还和实施这项手术的医生的技术水平有关，那么医生把自己的经验看得比其他人的经验重就是比较明智的做法。但是，直接经验的鲜活性往往会导致个体把直接经验看得过度重于很多个体的聚合经验。风险极小的情况下，只有经验非常丰富的医生才能积累足够大的经验样本以对聚合经验统计值进行修订。特别是小概率事件的出现次数分布是严重倾斜的，这会导致自身经验好于聚合经验平均值的医生大大多于自身经验差于聚合经验平均值的医生。

直接经验在人事决策中也有类似的误导性（Dawes，Faust，and Meehl 1989）。很多组织在招聘选拔中经常使用个人陈述或者个人面谈等技术。系统而言，这样的直接经验给人的震撼超过了提供的信息应该有的样子，因此往往被赋予过高的权重。结果，个人陈述，例如介绍自己的工作（job talk），更有可能降低而非提高人事决策的有效性。不稳定的但比较震撼的直接印象压倒了用比较系统的、比较有效的但较不震撼的方式收集而来的信息（Dawes，Faust，and Meehl 1989）。

#### 5.2.2 启示的模糊性

Ambiguity of the Lessons of Experience

Experience has to be converted into lessons learned, and the conversion is both difficult and unending. As Simone de Beauvoir observed,"To declare that existence is absurd is to deny that it can ever be given a meaning; to say that it is ambiguous is to assert that its meaning is never fixed, that it must be constantly won"([1948] 1980, 129). Knowing what happened is sometimes possible, though it is often difficult. Knowing why it happened, and thus being able to make inferences about the events of the past, involves forming implicit or explicit causal inferences in situations that invite debate and error.

The ambiguity of experience has many causes and takes many forms, but a significant fraction of them can be summarized in terms of five attributes of experience:

• First, the causal structure of experience is complex. Many uncontrolled variables are involved, and their relations include multiple interactions and multiple colinearities. The relations among the variables may include numerous instances of feedback loops, a variety of time delays, and unknown functional forms. As a result, it is difficult to uncover the causal structure and to identify the effects of actions. For example, a legendary feature of organizational inference forming is the inclination to attribute outcomes (particularly favorable ones) to organizational actions in situations in which general economic or political conditions, the actions of others, and any number of other uncontrolled factors may contribute substantially. Moreover, many variables that seem likely to be important are difficult to observe and elusive to measure. As a result, the lessons derived from experiential learning are rife with unjustified conclusions, superstitious associations, misleading correlations, tautological generalizations, and systematic biases.

• Second, experience is noisy. The events of history are drawn from a distribution of possibilities, either because of errors in observation or interpretation or because the causal structure is truly stochastic. A particular realized history is likely to be a quite poor representation of the possibilities. As a result, learning from experience involves trying to learn not only from the actual events observed but also from the events that did not occur but might quite easily have occurred. The generation of such hypothetical histories replaces evidence with imagination, with all the invitations to error that such a substitution involves.

• Third, history includes numerous examples of endogeneity, cases in which the properties of the world are affected by actions adapting to it. Capabilities are affected by practice, and the rate of practice is affected by the choices made. Organizations and their environments coevolve. The desires (wants) of actors affect actions, but the actions also affect the wants. History is a series of samples, but the sampling rates, and therefore the sampling errors, of the various alternatives are affected by the unfolding of experience.

• Fourth, history as it is known is constructed by participants and observers. Individuals learn not from history but from historical stories, including the stories they tell themselves, that are concocted for a purpose. The spin doctor was as familiar to the writing of Egyptian history or Norse sagas as he or she is today. Winston Churchill has been quoted as saying,"History will be kind to me, for I intend to write it."The proposition that the mean of lies converges to truth as the sample size increases is not easily demonstrated, either empirically or deductively.

• Fifth, history is miserly in providing experience. It offers only small samples and thus large sampling error in the inferences formed. If a statistician undertook to design an observational world that would frustrate inference, the resulting design might look a good deal like much of the natural experience of organizations. Organizations try to learn from small samples, often samples of one or fewer. They try to make inferences from observations of events involving unique, changing contexts and conditions. Without experimental control over key variables or a large sample of observations under varying (and observable) conditions, the search for causal identification is seriously compromised. Imagination becomes at least as significant as observation. As Marvin Minsky observed in contemplating the problems of artificial intelligence,"By themselves, simple learning systems are only useful in recurrent situations; they cannot cope with significant novelty. Nontrivial performance is obtained only when learning systems are supplemented with classification or pattern-recognition methods of some inductive ability. For the variety of objects encountered is so enormous that we cannot depend upon recurrence"(1963, 413).

The lessons of history can be hard to discern through participating in it. It is difficult for organizational participants to learn from experience, and their attempts to do so are prone to error (Mezias and Starbuck 2003; Baumard and Starbuck 2005). Experience often appears to increase significantly the confidence of successful managers in their capabilities without greatly expanding their understanding. The failures are not particularly due to weaknesses in managers or their training. Detecting the effects of variation in one or two factors in a complex system normally requires both holding other things constant and making big enough changes in the variables of interest to be detectable over the noise. In practice, organizations tend to change many things simultaneously and to make relatively small changes.

经验必须转化成启示，这个转化既困难又没有止境。正如西蒙·波伏娃（Simon de Beauvoir）观察到的那样：「宣称存在是荒谬的，就是否认可以对存在赋予意义；说存在是模糊的，就是宣称存在的意义永远无法确定、人类必须一直为存在争取意义」（［1948］1980，129）。发生了什么，往往是很难知道的，但有时是可以知道的。知道一个事件为什么发生，进而能够从经验中挖掘启示，涉及在容易引发争论和错误的情境下形成或明或暗的因果推断。

经验的模糊性，原因有很多，表现形式也有很多。不过，经验的模糊性大体上可以总结为以下五点：

第一，经验的因果结构是复杂的（complex）。很多变量是不可控的，变量之间可能存在多重交互作用或者多重共线关系，有的变量两两互为因果，有的变量存在时滞变异，变量关系的函数形式有很多是未知的。因此，因果结构很难厘清，行动效应很难确认。例如，人们在根据组织经验做推断时，非常容易把结果（特别是有利结果）归因于组织的行动，而实际上，大的经济或政治环境、其他组织的行动以及很多其他的不可控因素也许对结果有巨大的影响。此外，很多似乎非常重要的变量是不好观察、不好测量的。因此，从体验式学习获得的启示，有很多未经证明的结论、迷信的联想、误导人的相关性、同义反复的概括和系统的偏差。

第二，经验是嘈杂的（noisy）。因为观察误差，或者因为诠释误差，或者因为因果结构真的就是随机的，所以历史事件是取自可能历史事件分布的一个值。某次变现历史的代表性有可能很差，代表不了可能历史。因此，从经验中学习涉及两方面，即不仅要努力从观察到的实际事件中学习，还要努力从实际上没有发生但原本应该发生的事件中学习。我们也应看到，上述的「假设历史」用想象替代了证据，这种替代也容易犯下许多错误。

第三，历史具有内源性（endogeneity）。能力受练习的影响，练习率受所做选择的影响。组织与环境共同演化。行动者的欲望影响行动，行动也影响行动者的欲望。历史是一系列样本，经验的展开方式，影响着选项的抽样率，进而影响着抽样误差。

第四，众所周知，历史是由参与者和观察者建构的（constructed）。人们不仅从历史中学习，还从历史故事中学习，包括他们自己出于某种目的捏造并讲述的故事。古往今来的政治顾问都通晓各种写史手法。据传，温斯顿·丘吉尔（Winston Churchill）曾经说过：

「历史会善待我的，因为我打算书写历史。」谎言的平均值随着样本量的增加而趋近于真相，这个命题并不好证明，不管是通过实证检验还是通过理论推导。

第五，历史是吝啬的（miserly），只能提供少量的经验。历史只能提供小样本，因此给推断带来很大的抽样误差。如果一位统计学家奉命设计一个可以观察但很难做推断的世界，那么他的设计成果就会非常接近组织的原始经验。组织学习所依赖的经验，样本量经常小到只有一两次经历。组织推断所依赖的事件，发生背景和发生条件经常是独一无二、不断变化的。在不断变化（而且可以观察）的条件下，不对关键变量进行实验控制，又得不到大样本，就很难确定因果结构。想象变得至少像观察一样重要。正如马文·明斯基（Marvin Minsky）在研究人工智能问题时观察到的那样，「从本质上来说，简单学习系统只在重复性情境中有用，应付不了新异情境。学习系统只有辅以具有一些推导能力的分类法或者模式识别法，才能获得非凡的成绩。因为遇到的对象是如此五花八门，所以我们不能依靠重复」（1963，413）。

参与到历史中，可能就很难从历史中挖掘启示。组织参与者很难从经验中学习，他们在努力从经验中学习的时候容易出错（Mezias and Starbuck 2003；Bau-mard and Starbuck 2005）。经验往往会大大提高成功管理者的信心，但是并不见得大大拓宽成功管理者的理解。之所以如此，并非只因为管理者的弱点或者管理者培训的弱点。在复杂的系统中，要考察一两个因素的效应，往往就要让其他因素保持不变并且让所考察的因素发生很大的变化，这样才能从噪声中区分出效应。在现实世界中，组织倾向于同时改变很多因素，而且变化幅度相对较小。

#### 5.2.3 诠释的灵活性

Flexible Interpretations

The events of ambiguous experience are given meaning through flexible interpretations. As the French poet-philosopher-historian Paul Valéry said,"History will justify anything. It teaches precisely nothing, for it contains everything and furnishes examples of everything"(quoted in White 1987, 36). Flexibility preserves mythic frames at the cost of weakening their predictive power. The trade-off makes more sense if the point is to preserve agreement on stories or to assure capabilities for explaining experience after the fact than it does if the point is to capture an extrastory reality or to use experience to predict the future. In general, stories and models are more commonly used for ex post explanations than for ex ante predictions.

Flexibility in interpretation is facilitated by natural language and symbolic abstractions and by the ways in which they are used. Natural language storytellers call forth meaning through language, particularly through metaphor (e.g.,"learning,""exploration"and"exploitation,""decision,""power,""garbage can"). Mathematical storytellers similarly call forth meaning through abstract symbols that allow imaginative extensions — for example, the interpretation of models of the spread of disease as models of the spread of technology.

A flexible quest for shared understandings that seem intelligent is probably more served by the ambiguities of history than frustrated by them. Failures can be interpreted to preserve belief (Baumard and Starbuck 2005). If a revolution fails, it may be because it was a bad idea, but it also may be because it was not pursued with enough vigor. If a policy fails, the failure may be a consequence of the policy, but it also may be a consequence of social forces or of inadequate or malicious implementation. If a pilot experiences a near collision with another aircraft, it may be a warning of dangerous practice and treated as a failure, but it also may be taken as an indication of superior skill in avoiding a collision and treated as a success (Tamuz 1988).

Interpretive flexibility assures that any specific experience will be consistent with a variety of different lessons. For example, many stories build on evaluations, and many of the evaluations of the experiences of organizations or their managements are justified by observations that could as easily justify quite different evaluations (March 1994, 87–89). The same managerial behavior can be labeled as either"bold"or"impetuous,"while its opposite can be labeled as either"careful"or"timid."The difference between an"arrogant"manager and a"self-assured"one can be as difficult to discern as the difference between an"insecure"manager and a"consultative"one. It is not that evaluative stories are indifferent to data. They typically draw upon them extensively. But just as the same face can easily produce quite different, even contradictory, portraits, the same observations of organizational experience can produce evaluations that differ profoundly.

There are other features of standard frames that facilitate fitting disparate experience into standard frames. For example, the stories and models of social science are filled with tautologies. Power is the capability to get what one wants; it is measured by the extent to which one gets what one wants. Individuals pursue their interests; their interests are inferred from what they pursue. Things that are not understood are given labels that provide a linguistic appearance of explanatory power but are better seen as admissions of a lack of understanding or as place markers for subsequent development. In the stories of psychology,"personality"often serves as a label for what is not understood — the unexplained variance. In the stories of sociology and anthropology,"culture"plays a similar role, as do"power"in political science,"utility"in economics, and"mutation"in evolutionary biology. In popular stories,"human nature"often serves a similar purpose. Such labels give stories an aura of stable verisimilitude while providing a flexible fit to experience. They typically provide great capabilities for creating stories of post hoc explanatory appeal but little or no predictive power or engineering leverage.

模糊的经验，通过灵活的诠释获得意义。正如法国诗人兼哲学家、历史学家保罗·瓦莱里（Paul Valery）所说的那样：「历史可以为任何事情辩护。历史实际上教不了人们什么东西，因为历史什么都有，不管什么事情都能从中找到例证（quoted in White 1987，36）。」诠释的灵活性牺牲预测力保全神话框架。这种权衡的关键，与其说是在于是抓住超故事现实还是利用经验预测未来，还不如说是在于是确保对故事的共识还是确保事后解释经验的能力。一般而言，故事和模型更常用于事后解释而非事前预测。

诠释的灵活性，得力于自然语言、符号抽象以及各自的使用方法。自然语言故事讲述者通过语言引发意义生成，特别是通过暗喻（例如，「学习」、「探索」和「开发」、「决策」、「权力」、「垃圾桶」）。类似的，数学故事讲述者通过那些允许想象延伸的抽象符号引发意义生成，例如，用疾病传播模型诠释技术的传播。

对灵活地追求看似智慧的共识而言，历史的模糊性利大于弊。失败可以诠释成坚守信念（Baumard and Starbuck 2005）。一次改革失败，可能是因为改革方案本身就不好，也可能是因为改革力度不够。一项政策失败，可能是因为政策本身存在问题，也可能是因为社会力量的阻挠，或者实施力度不够，或者实施者心怀不轨。一位飞行员驾驶的飞机差点与另外一架飞机相撞，这次经历可以看成一次失败、一个警告，警告着飞行员的操作方式非常危险，也可以看成一次成功、一个指标，表明飞行员避免相撞的技术非常高超（Tamuz 1988）。

因为诠释是灵活的，所以不管什么经验，都可从不同角度挖掘到不同启示。例如，很多故事的建构以评价为基础，而对组织经验或组织管理的各种评价，即使十分不同，也往往可以用同样的观察加以证明（March 1994，87—89）。同一管理行为，可以贴上「大胆的」标签，也可以贴上「冲动的」标签；与之相反的管理行为，可以贴上「谨慎的」标签，也可以贴上「保守的」标签。「自大的」管理者与「自信的」管理者之间的区别非常模糊，就像「没有主见的」管理者与「尊重他人意见的」管理者之间的区别一样。评价性故事不是对数据漠不关心，反而往往是广泛地借鉴数据。但是，就像照着同一张脸可以画出不同甚至截然相反的肖像一样，对组织经验的同一观察也可以导致不同的评价。

标准框架还有其他特征，有助于把迥异的经验纳入同一标准框架。例如，社会科学的故事和模型充满同义反复。权力就是得到自己想要之物的能力。权力的大小，用一个人在多大程度上获得自己想要之物来衡量。人们追求利益，从一个人的追求可以推断出一个人的利益所在。理解不了某事物，就给它贴上一个标签，让它在语言学上看似被解释了。实际上，贴标签与其说是进行解释，不如说是承认缺乏理解，或者说是放上一个占位符，留待进一步研究。在心理学故事中，「人格」经常被人用作标签贴在一些理解不了的东西上，也就是不能解释的变异上。在社会学和人类学故事中，「文化」也起着类似的作用，就像政治学中的「权力」、经济学中的「效用」、进化生物学中的「突变」一样。在大众故事中，「人性」有着类似的作用。这样的标签，在让故事灵活地拟合经验的同时，还让故事显得很有真实感。有了这样的标签，就比较容易创作具有事后解释力，但没有什么预测力，也没有什么指导作用的故事。

#### 5.2.4 回避经验的问题

Avoiding the Problems of Experience

Perhaps because of the conspicuous problems in interpreting history, much of the knowledge used in organizations develops in ways somewhat different from those that might be expected from a conception of experience-based action. First, much of what is believed in organizations is a collection of derivations from simple assumptions. The entire apparatus of the economic theory of organizations, for example, has very little detailed empirical basis. It consists primarily in theorems derived from a few elementary propositions about human behavior. The great advantage of such an approach to knowledge is that one can demonstrate the correctness of the theorems as a technical matter rather than as a matter of inference from data. Derivations within theories of organizations include a number of verifiable, but not particularly startling, predictions, such as the idea that increasing the wages offered for a position will increase the number of people willing to take the job. They also contain a few instructive surprises, such as propositions about the"the tragedy of the commons,"the"winner’s curse,"the"prisoners’ dilemma,"or"competency traps."

Second, much of what is believed about organizations derives from an engineering conception of knowledge. A full scientific conception of knowledge seeks to understand a system well enough to be able to anticipate the necessary subsequent condition of any possible antecedent conditions. An engineering conception of knowledge seeks a set of antecedent conditions sufficient to produce a particular subsequent condition. A child learning to ride a bicycle does not attempt to understand the full intricacies of bicycle dynamics but only a set of movements and responses adequate to sustain balance and movement. An organization looks for organizational forms, practices, and products that are adequate to achieve targets and to improve in a familiar situation. It does not seek to know the likely consequences of all possible combinations of forms, practices, and products under all conditions.

Third, rather than seeking to understand a complex world, organizations often seek to create simpler worlds they can understand. Rather than build with materials freely available, they create materials with comprehensible and manageable attributes. Rather than try to understand the full richness of human behavior, they classify, train, and constrain human actors to make them comprehensible and manageable (Foucault 1961, 1975; Holmqvist 2008). Rather than depend on the future reliability of partners, they write contracts. Rather than run risks, they buy insurance. Rather than predict the outcomes of a gamble, they arbitrage among the differing expectations of others.

也许因为经验存在明显的问题，所以组织使用的知识的形成方式大多并不像人们期望的那样是基于经验的。第一，有关组织的信念，大多衍生自一些简单的假定。例如，整套经济学组织理论，几乎没有什么具体的实证基础，主要包含一些衍生自几条有关人类行为基本命题的定理。这样的知识形成方式有一个很大的优点，那就是定理的正确性是从技术上证明的，而不是用数据验证的。那些衍生定理，包含一些可以证实但不是特别令人吃惊的预测，比如，增加某个职位的薪水可以增加接受这个职位的人数。还包含少数具有启发性的意外，比如，有关「公地悲剧」、「赢家诅咒」、「囚徒困境」或者「胜任力陷阱」的命题。

第二，有关组织的信念，大多是在工程学知识观的指导下形成的。纯科学知识观追求的是，弄清任何可能前提的必然结论。工程学知识观追求的是，弄清产生某个结论的充分前提。学骑自行车的孩子，不求理解自行车动力学原理，只想知道哪些动作和反应足以维持平衡和前进。组织只想找到足以实现目标并且能在熟悉情境下加以改进的形式、实务和产品，不求弄清各种可能形式、实务和产品的所有可能结合在所有条件下会出现什么结果。

第三，组织不求理解复杂的世界，但求创造一个自己可以理解的比较简单的世界。组织不是使用可以自由获取的现成材料，而是创造具有易理解性和易管理性的材料。组织不求全面了解人类的所有行为，而是只求对人类行动者分类、培训、约束，让人类行动者好理解、好管理（Foucault 1961，1975；Holmqvist 2008）。组织不依靠合作伙伴的未来可靠性，而是签合同。组织不冒险，而是买保险。组织不预测多方博弈的结果，而是协调多方的不同期望。

The Bottom Line

If there is one lesson to be gleaned from the explorations in this book, it is that learning from experience is an imperfect instrument for finding the truth. Much of organizational and managerial life will produce vividly compelling experiences from which individuals and organizations will learn with considerable confidence, but the lessons that they learn are likely to be incomplete, superstitious, self-confirming, or mythic. They will characteristically lead to suboptimal choices and are unlikely to yield valid characterizations of the causal processes underlying the experiences. Experience is likely to generate confidence more reliably than it generates competence and to stop experimentation too soon. As a result, there is a persistent disparity between the assurance with which advice is provided by experienced people and the quality of the advice. Berndt Brehmer (1980), the Swedish psychologist, summarized the evidence in a title for an article published in 1980:"In One Word: Not from Experience."Experience may possibly be the best teacher, but it is not a particularly good teacher.

The observation is not that knowledge in general is impossible. Knowledge about human behavior can be impressive, but it is most impressive when it is embedded in stable cultural and institutional contexts or derived from settings where repeated, controlled observations are possible. In domains that are experienced less frequently and are less constrained, direct experience is often both less informative and more compelling. As a result, a subjective assurance of understanding derived from experience may be poorly correlated with genuine knowledge.

The contrast between the enthusiasms for experiential learning on the one hand and its deficiencies on the other have led to persistent efforts to discover alternative conceptions of inference more consistent with the possibilities of experience. Some of these procedures are effectively variations on multivariate statistics by which the underlying complexities are approximated through a combination of simple, generic models and large databases. They depend critically both on the efficacy of the simple models and on adequate numbers of observations. In ordinary experience, the former is doubtful and the latter is rare, so the usefulness of the technology is normally limited to large database formal research studies in domains in which the causal structure is transparent.

Alternatively, it is frequently argued that useful understanding of the causal basis of experience can be extracted from the small sample sizes of ordinary experience. Among others (e.g., Malan and Kriger 1998), I have argued that it is possible to learn from"samples of one or fewer"(March, Sproull, and Tamuz 1991). A similar argument runs through much of the advocacy of case studies (Herbst 1970; George and McKeown 1985; Mohr 1985),"thick description"(Geertz 1973; Gherardi 2006), and literature (Gagliardi and Czarniawska 2006; March 2008, chap. 18) as sources of knowledge.

The notion that it is possible to discern valid lessons about the world from detailed descriptions of specific episodes of ordinary experience finds an enthusiastic audience. It confirms the intuition and practice of most people. It reflects such a widely held belief that it is judicious to be cautious in denying it. However, it is hard to specify a theory of inference that sustains the idea unambiguously against a more conservative judgment of doubt. Although the literature exhibits a persistent aspiration that analyses based on rich descriptions and imagined histories may be linked to ideas about inference from empirical evidence, a conclusive justification of stories of experience as bases for genuine knowledge is more elusive than would be expected from the enthusiasm for it.

From the perspective of those who oppose it, the argument in favor of samples of one or fewer can be seen as an attempt to provide some kind of intellectual foundation for a deep human predilection to stories. Intellect is enlisted as an advocate for storytelling. Arguments are mobilized to provide a justification for the subjective sensations of pleasure and intelligence gained from converting instances of experience into possible understandings of the world. Since the ability and eagerness of human intellect to conjure utilitarian justifications for intuitive prejudices is one of the more endearing human traits, the efforts are often elegant and even persuasive.

Enthusiasm for learning from samples of one or fewer permeates ordinary life as well as much of social science and should not be summarily dismissed. In order to make the lessons from meager experience accessible, however, it is probably necessary to experience things richly, drawing on more aspects of history and more interpretations. It is probably necessary to consider events from the perspective of multiple preferences. It is probably necessary to supplement the data of history with the data of virtual experience, using"near histories"and hypothetical histories. In this way, the process of translating experience into understanding and understanding into action will often be an exercise of imagination that supplements or replaces data-based inference and logical derivation (March, Sproull, and Tamuz 1991).

如果本书的探讨能给读者什么启示的话，那就是从经验中学习是不完美的真相发现手段。大部分组织生活和管理生活会提供生动的、令人震撼的经验，个人和组织会怀着很大的信心从这些经验中学习，但是获得的启示很有可能是片面的、迷信的、自证的或者虚构的。从经验中学习，极有可能导致次优选择，不大可能有效揭示深层因果结构。经验可能让信心的增长快于能力的增长，而且让尝试过早终止。结果，经验丰富的人对自己所提建议的把握往往高于自己所提建议的质量。1980 年，瑞典心理学家贝恩特·布莱默（Berndt Brehmer）发表了一篇文章，该文章的标题就是「一句话：别从经验中来」。经验也许是最好的老师，但不是特别好的老师。

经验并非不可能形成一般知识。有关人类行为的知识，是可以令人印象深刻的，但是，当它镶嵌在稳定的文化和制度背景中时，或者当它形成于可以反复进行受控观察的情境时，它最令人印象深刻。在积累不了多少经验、不能施加多少控制的领域，直接经验往往既提供不了多少信息，又特别令人震撼。结果，从经验中学习，经常会出现自以为掌握真相其实距离真相甚远的情况。

一方面是对体验式学习的狂热，另一方面是体验式学习的缺陷，两相对比之下，学者就一直在努力寻找其他能够更好地利用经验潜力的推断技术。所找到的推断技术，有些衍生自多变量统计学。多变量统计学，靠结合简单模型和大型数据库来接近复杂的深层现实。因此，这些技术特别依赖简单模型的效力和足够次数的观察。在日常经验中，简单模型的效力令人怀疑，足够次数的观察很难做到。因此，这些技术只有在因果结构透明的领域进行大型正式研究时才能使用。

除了多变量统计这条思路之外，还有另外一条思路，那就是，从小样本的日常经验中获得对深层因果结构的有用理解。我（March，Sproull，and Tamuz 1991）以及其他一些组织学者（Malan and Kriger 1998）曾论证过，从「一两次经历」中学习是有可能的。大多数倡导从案例研究中获取知识的人（Herbst 1970；George and McKeown 1985；Mohr 1985）、倡导从「深描（thick description）」中获取知识的人（Geertz 1973；Gherardi 2006）、倡导从文学中获取知识的人（Gagliardi and Cz-arniawska 2006；March2008，第 18 章），也进行过类似的论证。

「从对日常经验具体情节的详细描述中是有可能挖掘出有关世界的有效启示的」这一小样本体验式学习理念有很多热情的听众。它符合大多数人的直觉和做法。支持它的人是如此之多，以致反对它需要极其谨慎。但是，毕竟还是有人对它持怀疑态度，而且，很难提出一个具体的推断理论来有力地打消那些人的怀疑。尽管文学一直希望基于详细描述和假想历史的分析结果也许与基于经验数据的推断结果相近，但是小样本体验式学习理念并不像轻易赢得很多热情的听众那样能够轻易得到有力的辩护。

这一理念的反对者认为：主张从一两次经历中学习，可以看成是企图为人类对故事的深深喜爱提供某种智慧依据。知识分子是倡导故事讲述的主力军。很多知识分子纷纷为在把经验转化成对世界的理解的过程中获得的主观快乐感和智慧辩护。既然人类的一个比较可爱的特点就是，能够而且渴望从功利主义角度为人类的直觉型偏见辩护，那么知识分子的那种努力经常就是优雅的，甚至是有说服力的。

对从一两次经历中学习的热情不仅渗透在日常生活中，而且渗透在社会科学中，这一热情不该立即予以打击。然而，为了从一两次经历中挖掘启示，也许有必要在为数不多的每次经历中更深入地体验、收集更多信息、从更多角度反思；也许还有必要从多重偏好的角度反思；也许还有必要在经验数据之外补充虚拟经验数据，使用「几近历史（near history，意思是，很有可能发生但实际上没有发生的历史）」和假设历史。这样，把经验转化成理解、把理解转化成行动的过程将经常是用想象补充或者替代基于数据的推断和逻辑推导的过程（March，Sproull，and Tamuz 1991）。

### 5.3 经验与人类智慧

EXPERIENCE AND HUMAN INTELLECT

The case for experiential knowledge as an effective instrument of adaptation is relatively weak in normal terms, but intelligence is not fully comprehended in terms of instrumental utility. In chapter 1, organizations were pictured as pursuing intelligence, and intelligence was presented as having two components. The first involves the instrumental utility of adaptation to the environment. The second involves the gratuitous interpretation of the nature of things through the use of human intellect. From the second point of view, experience is less a source of adaptive improvement than a stimulant to a fundamental human activity — the creation and decoration of irrelevant understanding.

Human intellect displays itself through curiosity about the world, through the gossip, conversations, stories, accounts, explanations, theories, and mythologies that (a) make existence meaningful in an interesting way (March and Sevón 1984), (b) provide rationalizations for willfulness (Feldman and March 1981), and (c) exhibit human imagination. Within such a perspective, understandings of experience are not so much instruments of life as they are life itself (Czarniawska 1997, 21); and the pursuit of meaning is less a method of effective adaptation than an essential activity of storytelling human beings (March and Olsen 1975, 1976; March 1994, 212–19).

Storytelling and the construction of models are elemental human activities by which human actors establish their own unique intelligence and the intellectuality of their species. In this perspective, storytelling and model building may be instrumental to adaptiveness, but that instrumentality is secondary to the differentiation that intellect provides, both among humans and among species. It is hard not to be charmed by such a vision of the intellectual primacy of irrelevant imagination. It strikes a chord that is sometimes drowned in the clatter of demands for utilitarian practicality. It conjures a dream of autonomy for intellect that glorifies one of the more distinct attributes of human existence. It grants an arbitrary status to the human mind. It is a kind of declaration of preeminence for aesthetic criteria of worth.

However, any such declaration of preeminence, even if it is resonant with classical human aspirations, represents a subordination of other legitimate claims. The ranking of claims of value is an unfortunate capitulation to the tyranny of theories of choice. The weighting of values rationalizes trade-offs but denies human capabilities for pursuing unresolved conflicts in desire. When my granddaughters were young, they had best friends, a not particularly noteworthy fact except that each of them had not one but numerous best friends — each best friend, I assume, a better friend than the others. I came to recognize that by refusing to calibrate the values of highly valued things in a way that assigned unique preeminence to any one of them, my granddaughters imported wisdom into grammar.

The creation and contemplation of imaginative understanding are distinctively and gloriously human, but they are not alone in this. Adaptive improvement through deliberate problem solving is also an exquisite feature of human distinctiveness. Intelligence involves the beauties of crafting understandings of experience, as reflected in the grace of storytelling and the elegance of model building. It also involves the efficiencies of adaptation, as reflected in the use of experience for careful analysis and pragmatic improvement. The lessons of experience are both monuments to the splendor of human imagination and instruments of effective problem solving. In tribute to the wisdom of granddaughters, each of these components of human intelligence can be seen as more important than the other.

用根据经验知识有效地适应环境的案例阐述人类智慧是不够的，因为仅仅从工具效用角度出发是无法完全理解智慧的。在第 1 章，我们说过，组织追求智慧，智慧有两个要素。第一个是，有效地适应环境，这个属于工具效用。第二个是，优雅地诠释经验。从第二个角度来看，与其说经验是适应工具、进步动力，不如说经验激发了一项根本的人类活动 —— 创造并装饰没有实际用途的知识。

人类通过具有以下三个功能的好奇、流言、交谈、故事、叙述、解释、理论和神话彰显智慧：a）用有趣的方式对人类的存在赋予意义（March and Sevon，1984）；b）对人类的意图进行合理化（Feldman and March 1981）；c）展现人类的想象力。从这个角度来看，理解经验，与其说是为了生活，不如说就是生活（Czarniawska 1997，21）；追求意义，与其说是为了有效地适应，不如说是喜欢讲故事的人类的一项根本活动（March and Olsen 1975，1976；March 1994，212-219）。

故事讲述和模型建构是人类的基本活动，人类行动者通过这两样活动形成我们独有的智慧、彰显我们物种的智慧性。根据这种观点，故事讲述和模型建构也许是适应工具，但是更为重要的是，故事讲述和模型建构还能区分人类与其他物种的智慧高低，以及人与人的智慧高低。「没有实际用途的想象在智慧王国里占有重要地位」的观点很难不让人着迷。它在闹哄哄的一片功利主义叫嚣中喊出了另外一个声音，它表现了人类存在比较突出的一面 —— 对自由求知的渴望，它承认了人类心智的专制地位，它宣称了审美价值也很重要。

然而，任何有关审美价值也很重要的宣示，即使符合人类的古典志向，也都代表着对其他正统宣示的臣服。对价值排序，是对选择理论独霸天下令人遗憾的投降。对价值排序，是对权衡进行合理化，但是否认人类有能力追求相互冲突的目标。我的孙女们小时候有最好的朋友，这没什么值得说的，值得一说的是，每个孙女都有不止一个最好的朋友。我以为，每个最好的朋友应该都好于其他的朋友。后来，我认识到我的孙女们是多么的智慧：为什么非要排个高低呢？为什么不能认为每个都有独特的重要性呢？

通过想象理解世界是人类美好而独特的一面，通过有目的的问题解决适应环境、取得进步，也是人类美好而独特的一面。智慧涉及优雅地诠释经验，正如故事讲述和模型建造的美丽所反映的那样。智慧还涉及有效地适应环境，正如利用经验提高生产率所反映的那样。经验的启示，既是人类想象之壮丽的标志，又是有效解决问题的工具。借用我孙女们的智慧，我们可以认为，智慧的这两个要素都是最重要的。
