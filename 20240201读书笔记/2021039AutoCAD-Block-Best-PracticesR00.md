## Preface

Block is one of the most important productivity tools in AutoCAD. By optimizing your blocks, you will find that AutoCAD is not just about drawing lines or just get the drawings done. You can draw lines fast, but productivity is beyond that. It is not just to get the drawings done.

You need to be able to modify drawings easily during the design process. You may be able to finish your drawing very quickly, but you may spend too much time when you are doing revisions. If you do, then you are not productive. Drawings also should provide necessary information. Furthermore, you will want to add some intelligence so that you can automate some process.

In this e-book, you can learn how to create, automate, and manage your blocks. We are not only discussing features, but we are also talking about productivity concept. Moreover, how you can use blocks to solve problems in AutoCAD.

Prerequisite: This e-book is intended for basic to intermediate AutoCAD users. However, I believe it can give some fresh information to veteran users. You have to at a minimum, know and able to use AutoCAD basic features.

The tutorial files: We include tutorial files with this e-book. Extract the zip file to a location you can access easily. When you find instruction to open a drawing file, you can find it in tutorial files folder.

Download the exercise file here: AutoCAD Block Best Practices tutorial files.

Drawing units in this e-book: This e-book uses the metric unit. However, drawing unit should not be an issue. You do not draw many objects in the exercises. We focus more on productivity concept.

However, if this book instructs you to create a new file, create it using ISO template.
