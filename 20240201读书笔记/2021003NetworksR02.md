连接与闭合

### 4.1 One world

On 4 November 2006, the disconnection of a single power line in north-west Germany triggered an avalanche of blackouts as far away as Portugal. One expects that such a small disconnection could have effects at the regional level, or at most within the national power grid. But electrical networks have become more and more integrated (currently, they form one large system at continental level) and then more fragile. The same has happened in other infrastructures. For example, almost all airports are interconnected: today it is possible to reach practically every destination, starting from any point of origin, with a limited number of stops on the way. The Internet is fully connected as well, since it has grown out of the integration of smaller networks.

Networks in nature and society may very well be fragmented in separated parts. In the cell, some groups of chemicals interact only with each other and with nothing else. In ecosystems, certain groups of species establish small foodwebs, without any connection to external species. In social systems, certain human groups may be totally separated from others. However, such disconnected groups, or components , are a strikingly small minority. In all networks, almost all the elements of the systems take part in one large connected structure, called a giant connected component.

For example, in one experiment based on mental associations between words, scientists found that 96 per cent of the terms ended up in one large group. One could find a path between any two expressions in this group, even such different terms as ‘volcano’ and ‘stomach’: the chain of associations drawn by the people participating in the experiment was ‘volcano’, ‘Hawaii’, ‘relax’, ‘comfort’, ‘pain’, and ‘stomach’. In general, the giant connected component includes not less than 90 to 95 per cent of the system in almost all networks. A few interesting consequences of this fact can be listed. In sexual interaction networks, past and current intercourse can connect us with individuals we would never imagine or desire to be related to. In organisms the network of collaboration between scientists, a large cooperation structure appears, omitting only a few lonely players. In company boards, interlocking grants a kind of connectedness that encompasses the vast majority of companies. Finally, in foodwebs, pollutants introduced in one species at a given location are brought by foodchains to apparently unrelated species as far away as on the opposite side of the planet.

Living in a big, connected world does not always imply that every node can be reached from every other. As with ordinary roads, where it is crucial to know if they are one-way or not, we must know if edges are directed. In a directed network, the existence of a path from one node to another does not guarantee that the journey can be made in the opposite direction. Wolves eat sheep, and sheep eat grass, but grass does not eat sheep, nor do sheep eat wolves. This restriction creates a complicated architecture within the giant connected component (Figure 6 ). For example, according to an estimate made in 1999, more than 90 per cent of the WWW is composed of pages connected to each other, if the direction of edges is ignored. However, if we take direction into account, the proportion of nodes mutually reachable is only 24 per cent, the giant strongly connected component. The rest is divided between an in-component and the out-component: the first is made up of pages with paths pointing to the giant strongly connected component, and the second of nodes that receive links coming out from it (the picture is completed by minor structures called tubes and tendrils ). This characteristic structure gives the giant connected component of the WWW a characteristic ‘bow-tie’ shape. This complicated structure is not specific to the WWW, but appears, with different components, in all directed networks.

The existence of the giant connected component — either with a bow-tie structure or not — is a remarkable feature. For example, the giant strongly connected component of the WWW, although being less than one-third of the system, still encompassed 56 million pages in 1999. An obvious explanation of this feature would arise if networks were very dense —  that is, if they had many redundant links, sufficient to connect every node with almost every other. Yet usually this is not the case. On the contrary, most networks are sparse , i.e. they tend to be quite frugal in connections. Take, for example, the airport network: the personal experience of every frequent traveller shows that direct flights are not that common, and intermediate stops are necessary to reach several destinations; thousands of airports are active, but each city is connected to less than 20 other cities, on average. The same happens in most networks. A measure of this is given by the mean number of connection of their nodes, that is, their average degree. We create many web pages every day, but the average number of links is about ten. Hundreds of thousands of routers connect the Internet, but each of them connects to fewer than three others, on average. Finally, in a sample of more than 50,000 physicists, the average number of collaborators was found to be about nine. In and now represents a wide variety of topics in history, philosophy, religion, science, and the humanities. The VSI , degree distributionmost real-world networks, there may be elements with many connections (and indeed, there are), but in general the graphs are not dense: on the contrary, they are said to be sparse.

This puzzling contradiction — a sparse network can still be very well connected — had already attracted the attention of the Hungarian mathematicians we encountered in Chapter 2 , Paul Erd ő s and Alfréd Rényi. They tackled it by producing different realizations of their random graph. In each of them, they changed the density of edges. They started with a very low density: less than one edge per node. It is natural to expect that, as the density increases, more and more nodes will be connected to each other. But what Erd ő s and Rényi found instead was a quite abrupt transition: several disconnected components coalesced suddenly into a large one, encompassing almost all the nodes. The sudden change happened at one specific critical density: when the average number of links per node (i.e. the average degree) was greater than one, then the giant connected component suddenly appeared. This result implies that networks display a very special kind of economy, intrinsic to their disordered structure: a small number of edges, even randomly distributed between nodes, is enough to generate a large structure that absorbs almost all the elements.

6 Networks with directed links, like the WWW, display a bow-tie structure: a central giant strongly connected component, an in-component, and an out-component, as well as minor structures (tubes, tendrils, and a few disconnected components). Data in the picture are from 1999.

一个世界

2006 年 11 月 4 日，德国西北部某地的一根输电线的断开引发了一场影响远及葡萄牙的雪崩式停电。人们以为这种小型断线故障的影响只限于区域层面，或至多限于国家电网范围之内。但电网的集成度已越来越高（目前，它们已在洲际层面形成了一个大型系），因而也更为脆弱。其他基础设施的情况也一样。例如，几乎所有的机场都是相互关联的：如今，人们从任何起点出发都可以沿着经停点有限的路线抵达几乎任何目的地。互联网也是完全互联的，因为它本就是从更小的网络集成中成长起来的。

自然和社会中的网络可能在局部地区显得极为分散。细胞中的一些化学物质组仅仅在彼此之间相互作用，而不与其他任何物质发生作用。在生态系統中，某些物种群体会建立小型食物网，而与外部物种没有任何联系。而在社会系统中，某些人类群体可能也与其他人完全隔绝。然而，这种分离的群或者称分量，仅为极少数。在所有网络中，系统内几乎所有组成部分都会参与到一个大型的连接结构之中，这个结构被称为巨型连通分量。

例如，科学家在基于词汇联想的一个实验中，发现 96% 的语词止步于某个语词大群体内部。人们可以在这个词群中找到任意两个词语的关联路径，甚至像「火山」与「胃」这样差别巨大的语词之间也有关联：该实验的参与者所绘制的联想链为，「火山」=>「夏威夷」=>「放松」=>「舒适」=>「疼痛」=>「胃」。

一般来说，巨型连通分量在几乎所有网络中都会占到 90-95% 的系統比例。我们可以列举这一事实的一些有趣后果。在性关系网络中，过去和当下的性行为能将我们与那些从未想象过或渴望有关系的人联系起来。大型的合作结构会出现在科学家的合作网络中，略去的只是少量孤僻的参与者。在公司的董事会中，连锁事给予了绝大多数公司某种关联性。最后，在食物网中，某个给定地点的某物种所引入的污染物，会通过食物链而被带到远至地球另一端明显不相关的物种身上。

生活在一个大的相互连接的世界中并不意味着其中的任意两个节点都能够互相抵达。正如对普通道路而言，是否为单行道非常关键，我们也必须知道边是否有向。在有向网络中，从一个节点到另外一个节点存在路径并不保证这条路反向也能行得通。狼吃羊，羊吃草，但草并不吃羊，羊也不吃狼。这种限制在巨型连通分量中创建了某种复杂的架构（图 6）。

例如，根据 1999 年的估计，若忽略边的方向，万维网有超过 90% 的部分由相互连接的页面组成。然而，如果我们将边的方向纳入考虑范围，万维网中彼此能够相互抵达的节点比例仅为 24%，这部分构成了所谓的巨型强连通分量。其余部分则以内向分量和外向分量进行划分：前者由那些路径指向巨型强连通分量的页面组成，后者则由那些接收来自巨型强连通分量的连接的节点组成（图形由被称为管道和卷须的小型结构补充完成）。这种特征结构予了万维网这个巨型连通分量结构某种「蝴蝶结」的外形特征。这种复杂的结构并非局限于万维网，而是在所有有向网络中都会带着不同的分量出现。

图 6 像万维网这样的有向网络会显示出「蝶结」结构：它由中间的巨型强连分量、内向分量、外向分量以及各种小结构（管道、卷须以及少量分离分量）组成。图中为 1999 年的数据

巨型连通分量的存在 一一 无论是否具备「蝴蝶结」结构 —— 是一个非常显著的特征。例如，尽管万维网的巨型强连通分量的规模比系本身的 1/3 还要小，但它在 1999 年时仍包含了 5600 万个网页。如果网络非常紧密，也就是说，如果它们拥有许多冗余连接，多到能够使几乎各节点都互相连接，那么便很容易解释这一特征。但通常情況并非如此。大多数网络反而是稀硫的，即它们的连接数往往很少。

以机场网络为例：每个频繁旅行者的经验都表明，直航并不常有，抵达一些目的地需要经过中转站；活跃的机场数上千，但平均起来，每个市仅与不到 20 个其他城市相互连通。大多数网络中的情况也是如此。这一情况可以由节点的平均连接数，即它们的平均度数体现出来。我们每天都创建许多网页，但每个网页的平均连接数大约为 10。无数的路由器接入了互联网，但每个路由器平均只与不到 3 个其他路由器相连。最后，在超过 5 万名物理学家的样本中，人们发现合作者的平均数量仅大约为 9。在大多数真实世界网络中，可能存在具有多连接的元素（事实上也确实存在），但一般说来，与此相对应的图并不紧密；相反，它们被认为是稀疏的。

这个令人困惑的矛盾 一一 一个稀疏的网络仍日可以很好地连接起来 一一 已经吸引了我们在第二章提到的匈牙利数学家保罗·埃尔德什和阿尔弗雷德·雷尼的注意。他们通过生成这些图的不同随机图解开了这个困惑。在每个随机图中，他们都改变了边的密度。他们以非常低的密度为起点：平均每个节点少于一条边。人们自然会期待，随着边的密度的增加，越来越多的节点将会彼此连接。但埃尔德什和雷尼所发现的却是一个相当突然的转変：一些分离分量突然合并为一个大的分量，后者几乎包含了所有节点发生在边达到一个特定的临界密度值时：当每个节点连线的平均数（即平均度数）大于一时，巨型连通分量便会突然出现。这个结果意昧着网络展现出某种十分特别的节约特征（这种特征是其无序结构所固有的）：甚至在节点之间随机分布的少量的边，都足以产生能够吸收几乎所有元素的大型结构。

### 4.2 So Close

In early 1994, three students at Albright College — Craig Fass, Brian Turtle, and Mike Ginelli — were watching television during a heavy snowstorm. According to their own reports, they noticed that Kevin Bacon, whose next movie was announced on television, was present in many different movies. So they began to speculate about the large number of actors that had starred with him in those movies. The idea that Bacon was a kind of ‘center of the entertainment universe’ started to spread, became famous, and a web page based on it even appeared, the Oracle of Kevin Bacon: this search engine provides the relation between Bacon and any actor one may search for. Remarkably, if one writes the name of a Spanish actor from old commercial movies, such as Paco Martínez Soria, the oracle finds a quite close relation: Martínez acted in Veraneo en España with Luís Induni; the latter acted in Il Bianco, il Giallo e il Nero with Eli Wallach; and Wallach acted in Mystic River with Kevin Bacon. Such short chains of collaborations with Bacon are found for almost any actor one may think about.

This surprising feature brings to mind a game played by scientists. Paul Erd ő s, the expert of random graphs, was one of the 20th century’s leading mathematicians. Scientists assign themselves, as a badge of honour, a measure of their collaboration with him: those that have co-authored a paper with him are said to have an Erd ő s number 1; co-authors of his co-authors have Erd ő s number 2; co-authors of co-authors of Erd ő s’ co-authors have Erd ő s number 3; and so on. However, only the lowest Erd ő s numbers are a real source of pride: more than 500 scientists were direct co-authors of Erd ő s’; and a few thousands have collaborated with this nucleus of co-authors. Finally, tens of thousands people have Erd ő s number 3 (G. C. is one such; M. C. has Erd ő s number 4), so it is not exactly something of special merit. Almost no scientist in any field has an Erd ő s number greater than 13.

Contrary to what one may believe, these notable results are nothing specific to Kevin Bacon or Paul Erd ő s. The former is not the centre of the entertainment world; nor is the second the hub of mathematics. If the same calculations are repeated with any other actor or scientist, similar results are found: very short chains connect apparently remote individuals. This fact gives an interesting insight into a quite common cocktail party experience: you are talking with a stranger and suddenly discover that he or she is your wife’s schoolmate, or your brother’s tennis partner, or your friend’s neighbour. This discovery is usually hailed as a surprise (‘It’s a small world!’), but it may not be so unusual. Social systems seem to be very tightly connected: in a large enough group of strangers, it is not unlikely to find pairs of people with quite short chains of relations connecting them.

近在咫尺

1994 年初，奥尔布赖特学院的三名学生 一一 克雷格·法斯、布莱恩·特特尔、迈克·吉内利 一一 在一场暴风雪天气里看电视。据他们说，他们注意到电视上预告了凯文·贝肯的下一部电影，但他也同时出现在了许多不同的电影中。于是他们开始历数在那些电影中与他合作的大量演员。贝肯有点类似于「娱乐世界的中心」的想法便开始传播，进而变得尽人皆知了，基于此甚至出现了一个网页，即「凯文·贝肯指南」：这个搜索引擎提供了贝肯和人们可能会搜索的任何其他演员之间的关系。值得注意的是，如果人们输入来自早先商业电影中某位西班牙演员的名字，比如帕科·马丁内斯·索里亚，该指南网页就会发现一个十分紧密的联系：马丁内斯与路易斯·因杜尼一起演过《在西班牙度假》（Veraneo en Espana）这部电影；后者和伊莱·瓦拉赫一起出演过电影《先开枪，再提问》（I Bianco, il Giallo e il Nero）；而瓦拉赫又与凯文·贝肯一起出演过《神秘河》（Mystic River）。这种与贝肯相关的合作链几乎能在人们所能想到的任何演员身上发现。

这个令人惊讶的特征让人想起一场科学家参与的游残。随机图专家保罗·埃尔德什乃是 20 世纪杰出的数学家。科学家们衡量了自己与埃尔德什的合作以作为自己荣誉的象征：那些与他共同撰写过一篇论文的人的埃尔德什数记为 1；那些埃尔德什合著者的合著者的埃尔德什数记为 2；而埃尔德什合著者合著者的合著者的埃尔徳什数记为 3；以此类推。然而，只有最小的埃尔徳什数字才是骄傲的真正来源：超过 500 位科学家乃埃尔徳什的直接合著者；而与这些核心的合著者合作过的科学家有几千人。最后，数以万计的人拥有埃尔徳什数 3（G.C就是其中之一；M.C 则拥有埃尔徳什数 4），所以这并非什么特别的荣誉。在一任何领域几乎都没有科学家拥有超过 13 的埃尔德什数。

1-3『埃尔德什数和埃尔德什这个数学家，之前听过，印象中他特别善于跟人合作，往往能弥补不同的缺陷，所以大家也都喜欢跟他合作，以与其合作为荣。（2021-02-10）』

完全出乎人们的意料，这些引人注目的结果并非贝肯或埃尔德什特有。前者并非娱乐界的中心人物；后者也并非数学的枢纽。如果在任何其他演员或科学家身上重复同样的计算，也会发现类似的结果：非常短的链条关联着相隔甚远的个体。这一事实为一次十分普通的鸡尾酒会经历提供了某种有趣的洞见：

当你与位陌生人聊天的时候，突然发现他或她是你妻子的同学，或者你兄弟的网球搭档，抑或你朋友的邻居，等等。这种发现通常让人们惊呼（世界真小！），但可能它并非那般不寻常。

1『一下子想到了六度分隔。（2021-02-10）』

社会系统似乎非常紧密地联系在一起：在一个足够大的陌生人群中，找到一对由十分短的关系链关联起来的人并非不可能。

### 4.3 Six degrees of separation

In 1967, American psychologist Stanley Milgram undertook a set of memorable experiments. With the collaboration of Jeffrey Travers, he sent tens of letters to citizens in the Midwest (Kansas and Nebraska), chosen at random. In the message, he asked them to forward the letter to a person in Massachusetts (either, the wife of a divinity student at Cambridge or a stockbroker in Boston), the address of whom he did not provide. In case they did not know the recipient, he suggested they forward the letter to somebody they knew, that might for some reason be ‘close’ to the recipients. For every forwarded letter, another one had to be sent to Milgram himself, so that he could follow the path of the messages. In a country of hundreds of millions, finding somebody by essentially a word-of-mouth procedure seems impossible. However, after a few days, the recipients started to receive the first letters. These had passed through only one intermediary. A few weeks later, when the experiment was declared finished, about a third of the letters had arrived at their destination: none had been sent more than ten times and, on average, the number of mailings was six.

The experiment sparked enthusiasm in the scientific community. In the 1950s, Manfred Kochen, a mathematician, and Ithiel de Sola Pool, a political scientist, had speculated that humans may be much ‘closer’ to each other than expected. They asked: If two persons are selected at random from a population, what are the chances that they would know each other? More generally, how long is the chain of acquaintanceship that is required to link them? In a highly circulated paper, which they eventually published in 1978, they proposed a mathematical model suggesting that, in a population such as that of the United States, an unexpectedly large fraction of pairs could be linked by chains with just a few intermediaries. Milgram’s experiment was an empirical test of their intuition. This finding had a strong impact even beyond the academic world. The expression six degrees of separation , referring to the number found in Milgram’s experiment, became the popular formulation of his results. In 1990, playwright John Guare used it as the title of a comedy in which a charismatic character dodges people, saying that he is the son of actor Sidney Poitier. Here is how Guare expressed Milgram’s results:

I read somewhere that everybody on this planet is separated by only six other people. Six degrees of separation. Between us and everybody else on this planet. The President of the United States. A gondolier in Venice. Fill Alessandro Vespignaniugu in the names. […] It’s not just big names. It’s anyone. A native in a rain forest. A Tierra del Fuegan. An Eskimo. I am bound to everyone on this planet by a trail of six people.

六度分隔理论

1967 年，美国心理学家斯坦利·米尔格拉姆进行了一系列值得铭记的实验。在杰弗里·特拉弗斯的协作下，米尔格拉姆向中西部（堪萨斯州和内布拉斯加州）的一些居民随机寄送了数十封信件。在信中，他请求这些人将信件转发至马萨诸塞州的某人（剑桥的神学学生的妻子，或者波顿的一位股票经纪人），而米尔格拉姆并未提供相关地址。如果这些居民并不认识收件人，米尔格拉姆则建议他们将信件转发至他们所认识的可能由于某种原因而与收件人「相熟」的人。人们在每次转发信件之时，都必须抄送一份给米尔格拉姆，以便他能够追踪信息的传递路径。在拥有数亿人口的国家内，依靠本质上为口口相传的方式找到某人似乎是不可能的。然而，几天后，收件人开始收到原始信件。这些信件仅仅经过了一位中间人。几周之后实验宣告完成，大约 1/3 的信件已经抵达其目的地：没有一封信件被转发超过 10 次，而平均邮寄次数为 6 次。

该实验激发了科学界的热情。1950 年代，数学家曼弗雷德·科亨和政治学家伊锡尔·德·索拉·普尔便猜测人类之间的联系可能比预想的更加紧密。他们道：如果从人群中随机抽取两人，他们认识彼此的概率有多大？通俗地讲，需要多长的相识链条才能将他们相互关联起来？在一篇最终于 1978 年发表的广为流传的论文中，他们提出了一个数学模型，表明在诸如美国这样的人口规模中，让人意想不到的是有很大部分人两两之间都可以通过少量的中间人链条而彼此连接。米尔格拉姆的实验则是对此二人直觉的检验。这个发现有很强的甚至超出学术界的影响。六度分隔理论这个术语中的数字来源于米尔格拉姆的实验发现，并成为其结果的一个通俗的表达。1990 年，剧作家约翰·瓜雷将其作为某喜剧的标题，该剧中一个魅力人物躲避人群，并声称自己是演员西德尼波蒂埃的儿子。以下便是瓜雷表达米尔格拉姆实验结果的方式。

我曾在处读到过，这个星球上的每个人和其他人之间都仅隔着六个人。这就是六度分隔理论。在我们和这颗星球上的其他毎个人之间。美国总统。威尼新的贡多拉船夫。还可以继续写下名字不仅仅是名人。而是任何人。雨林中的当地人。火地岛人。爱斯基摩人。我通过六个人与这颗星球上的每个人紧密地联系在一起。

### 4.4 Small worlds

Iloveyou was one of the most contagious computer viruses ever. After appearing on May 2000, it hit tens of millions of computers all over the world, producing billions of euros of damage, mainly the costs of eradicating it. Iloveyou arrived in an email, disguised in an attachment that looked like a love letter. When the attachment was opened, the virus infected the computer, and forwarded itself to the email addresses contained in the address book of that computer. After just a few replications of this kind, the virus reached an enormous number of devices. As in the social networks described in the previous paragraph, one could say about the computer network where viruses spread: ‘It’s a small world!’ A large number of computers are reached through just a few connections. Computers apparently far from each other turn out to be connected by short chains of links.

In reality, this small-world property , which is the main result of Milgram’s experiment, is present in all networks. The Internet is composed of hundreds of thousands of routers, but just about ten ‘jumps’ are enough to bring an information packet from one of them to any other. Thousands of kilometers may stand between them, but that is not the distance that matters: what matters is the number of connections to be crossed, and this is always very small. That is why information travels across the planet at an extraordinary velocity. Another example is the WWW: it is composed of billions of pages, but scientists have found that about twenty mouse ‘clicks’ are enough, on average, to navigate between any two of them. There are fewer than three ‘degrees of separation’, on average, between any pair of neurons in the brain of a C. elegans. In the import–export network that interconnects the countries of the world, it is impossible to find two states separated by more than two links. The list of examples could go on with many other cases.

The small-world property consists of the fact that the average distance between any two nodes (measured as the shortest path that connects them) is very small. Given a node in a network (say, Paul Erd ő s in the co-authorship network), few nodes are very close to it (direct co-authors) and few are far from it (scientists with very high Erd ő s numbers): the majority are at the average — and very short — distance. This holds for all networks: starting from one specific node, almost all the nodes are at very few steps from it; the number of nodes within a certain distance increases exponentially fast with the distance. Another way of explaining the same phenomenon (the way scientists usually spell it out) is the following: even if we add many nodes to a network, the average distance will not increase much; one has to increase the size of a network by several orders of magnitude to notice that the paths to new nodes are (just a little) longer.

The small-world property is crucial to many network phenomena. The short synaptic distance in the neocortex may be crucial to its functioning: some studies suggest that neurodegenerative illnesses such as Alzheimer’s imply a massive loss of the small-world property in the brain. Short distances in the sexual relations networks suggest that the concept of risk group in sexually transmitted diseases has to be interpreted carefully: virtually everybody is at a very short distance from somebody infected. This capab Alessandro Vespignaniuguility of networks to spread viral agents efficiently can also have constructive applications. One of the first examples of viral marketing strategy was the worldwide diffusion of the Hotmail email service, launched in 1996. People purchasing a free Hotmail address agreed to host in their messages a link that allowed recipients to open a free address in their turn. Hotmail had one of the fastest increases for a communication company, attacting tens of millions of users, partially due to this strategy that cleverly exploited the small-world nature of the email network.

小世界

「爱虫」（Iloveyou）病毒是史上最具传染性的计算机病毒之ー。自 2000 年 5 月出现之后，它便感染了世界各地数千万的计算机，造成主要用于清除它的损失达数十亿欧元。「爱虫」病毒以电子邮件的形式传，它伪装在一个酷似情书的附件中。当附件被打开，病毒便会感染计算机，并将自己转发至该计算机的地址海中所含的电邮地址中。经过仅仅几次这样的复制，该病毒便感染了大量设备。正如前面某段落所描绘的社交网络一样，人们或许这样谈论病毒传播的计算机网络：「世界真小！」仅仅数次连接便可访问大量计算机。彼此明显相隔甚远的计算机结果仅通过较短的关系链便相互连接。

在现实中，作为米尔格拉姆实验主要结果的这种小世界属性，存在于所有网络中。互联网由数十万个路由器组成，但信息包仅通过大约 10 次「跳跃」便足以从其中ー个路由器抵达其他任何一个。两者之间可能相隔数公里，但距离并不重要：重要的是必经的连接数，而这个数字往往很小。这就是为何信息能以非凡的速度在地球上传播的原因。另外一个例子是万维网：它由数十亿页面构成，但科学家发现，通常 20 次鼠标点击便足以连接其中任何两个页面。一般而言，在一只秀丽隐杆线虫的大脑中，任何一对神经元之间的距离都少于「三度分隔」。而在连接世界上所有国家的进出口网络中，无法找到被超过两条联系链条分隔的国家。这样的例子在其他很多事例中数不胜数。

小世界属性包含任意两节点之间的平均距离（被测定为关联它们的最短路径）十分小这一事实。给定某网络中的一个节点（比如在合著者网络中的埃尔德什），少数节点与它十分接近（即直接的合著者），与其相隔甚远的仍是少数（即那些持有很大埃尔德什数的科学家）：多数人则位于平均以及很短 一一 距离之内。这一点适用于所有网络：从一个特定节点开始，几乎所有的节点都仅与其相隔寥寥几步；特定范围内的节点数则随着距离的加以指数方式快速增加。相同现象的另一种解释方式（科学家们通常的说明方式）如下：即便我们向某个网络中增加了许多节点，平均距离也不会增加太多；人们不得不将网络大小増加几个数量级后，才能注意到通往新节点的路径変长了（一点点）。

小世界属性对许多网络现象至关重要。新皮质中较短的突触距离对其功能可能非常关键：一些研究表明，神经退行性疾病如阿尔茨海默症便说明大脑中的小世界属性大量丢失。而性关系网络中的短程关系则表明，解释性传播疾病中的风险群体这一概念时必须小心翼翼：事实上每个人距离那些被感染者都很近。网络这种有效传播病毒的能力也有其建设性用途。采用病毒式营销策略的首批案例之一是，微软 1996 年推出的电子邮箱服务（Hotmail）的全球性扩散。购买免费微软电邮地址的人须同意在他们的信件中附加一个链接，该链接允许收件人相应地打开一个免费地址。微软电邮在通信公司中增长最为迅速，它俘获了数千万用户，部分原因在于这个策略巧妙地利用了电子邮件网络的小世界属性。

### 4.5 Shortcuts

The small-world property is something intrinsic to networks. Even the completely random Erd ő s–Renyi graphs show this feature. By contrast, regular grids do not display it. If the Internet was a chessboard-like lattice, the average distance between two routers would be of the order of 1,000 jumps, and the Net would be much slower: no quick web browsing, no instant emails. If the network of scientific collaborations was a grid, Paul Erd ő s would have a moderate number of co-authors; these would have a larger, but still moderate, number of collaborators, etc.: the number of individuals within a certain distance would not grow exponentially but much more slowly. If the neurons network was a lattice, increasing the number of neurons (due to the physical growth of the brain, for example) would increase remarkably the average communication distance within the neocortex: paradoxically, growth would make people less smart (something young readers could agree with).

What makes a network different from a grid? What factor is responsible for the appearance of the small-world property in webs, while lattices lack it? In 1998, physicist Duncan Watts and mathematician Steven Strogatz tried to answer these questions. They started by considering a very simple, regular structure. It was a circle of nodes, and each of them was connected to its first- and second-nearest neighbours (Figure 7 left). This structure may represent a group of remote villages, each of them interchanging goods with the neighbouring villages, and occasionally with the neighbours of their neighbours. In such a regular structure, products can travel a long way from producers to consumers in faraway villages.

Watts and Strogatz then allowed for something very similar to opening a path between two distant villages. In practice, they cut one of the links in the initial structure and rewired it with another node, chosen at random. Suddenly, the inhabitants of one village can interchange goods with a previously remote area, instead of their neighbours. Still, on the large scale, just a few villages are affected by this change, and several areas of the circle remain far from each other. One can see this by computing the average distance between nodes after the rewiring: it is just moderately reduced by the new shortcut. At this point the two scientists allowed for more ‘paths’ (Figure 7 right). After every rewiring, they computed the average distance: remarkably, they found that, after rewiring just a few links, the distance dropped abruptly. A small number of shortcuts is enough to bring all the elements of the system much closer to each other. The key ingredient that transforms a structure of connections into a small world is the presence of a little disorder. No real network is an ordered array of elements. On the contrary, there are always connections ‘out of place’. It is precisely thanks to these connections that networks are small worlds.

These shortcuts are easy to identify in some nets. For example, in 1858, the first transatlantic telegraph cable connected Europe and America. This wonder of thousands of kilometres and hundreds of tonnes is one of the marvels of the oceans visited by the submarine in Jules Verne’s Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea. Today, several transoceanic cables grant immediate spreading of information throughout the world. In word networks, polysemy is one main source of shortcuts. For example, the word ‘pupil’ connects the two semantic areas of teaching, on the one hand (pupil as student) and vision, on the other (pupil as the body organ). In social networks, Granovetter’s concept of weak ties —  links that connect unrelated groups — could be at least partially matched with Watts and Strogatzsocial network

捷径

小世界属性是网络所固有的。即便完全随机的埃尔德什-雷尼图也表现出这种性质。相比之下，普通的网格并不会展现这一特征。如果互联网是一个棋盘状晶格，则任意两个路由器之间的平均距离将达 1000 步的级别，而网络本身也会慢很多：不会有快速的网页浏览，也没有即时的电子邮件。如果科学合作网络是一个网格，则埃尔德什仅会有中等数量的合著者；尽管后者的合作者数量会大些，但规模仍旧适中，以此类推：特定距离内的个体数量不会呈指数级增长，而是慢许多。如果神经网络是一个晶格，则増加神经元的数量（比如，由于大脑的自然发育）将显著加新皮层内的平均传递距离：矛盾的是，大脑的发育会让人变得不那么聪明（一些年轻读者可能会同意这一点）。

那又是什么使得网络与网格有所不同？网络中表现出的小世界属性为何又在晶格中缺乏？1998 年，物理学家邓肯·沃茨和数学家史蒂文·斯托加茨试图回答这些问题。他们以思考十分简单且规则的结构为出发点。这个结构为节点构成的圆形，其中每个节点都与其最近和次近的邻点相连（图 7 左）。这种结构可能代表了一组偏远的村庄，其中每个村庄都与其邻近村庄交换货物，偶尔也会与邻村的邻村交换。在这种规则的结构中，产品从生产者那里传递至遥远村庄的消费者处可能要很长一段距离。

图 7 在小世界网络模型中，引入无序后规则晶格便转为网絡，相应地，节点之间的距离也缩短了：小世界属性由此产生

接着，沃茨和斯托加茨引进一个类似规则使得两个遥远村庄之间开放路径。在实际操作中，他们切掉了原始结构的某条连线，并将其与其他节点重新随机连接。顷刻间，一个村庄的居民便能与之前遥远的地区而非其邻村交换货物了。然而，从整体上看，仅有几个村庄受到了这种变化的影响，圆中的一些区域彼此之间仍旧相隔甚远。人们可通过计算重连之后节点之间的平均距离看出这一点：引进新的捷径之后平均距离仅稍微变短。这时，两位科学家开放了更多的「路径」（图 7 右）。每次重新连接之后，他们都会计算节点之间的平均距离：他们发现，在重新加仅仅几处连线之后，平均距离明显缩短。少量捷径便足以大大缩短系統中所有元素彼此之间的距离。将连接结构转变为小世界的关键因素便是少量无序的出现。没有哪个真实的网络能呈现出有序的元素排列。相反，其中总存在一些「不合群」的连接。正是由于这些无序连接的存在，网络方为小世界。

这些捷径在某些网络中很容易识别。例如，1858 年第一个跨大西洋的电报电缆将欧洲和美国连接了起来。这个长达数公里、重达数百吨的奇迹是儒勒·凡尔纳的《海底两万里》中潜水艇造访过的海洋奇迹之一。如今，数条跨洋电让信息能够在世界范国内即时传递。在语词网络中，一词多义乃捷的主要来源之一。比如，「pupil」词连接着两个语义区，一个是「教学」（pupil 作为「学生」），另一个是「视觉」（pupil 作为「瞳孔」）。在社交网络中，格兰诺维特的弱连帯概念 一一 将不相关群体连接起来的联系 一一 至少可以与沃茨和斯托加茨的捷径概念部分对应。

捷径在许多其他情况下也是引发小世界属性的原因之一。然而，我们不时也能找到另外可能的解释。例如，世界贸易网络中的超短距离则源于它是少数高度紧密（非稀疏）的网络之一这个事实：一个国家的贸易伙伴平均数量一般可与这个网络里的国家总数相当，这意味着每个国家都与其他大多数国家相互进行贸易。在食物网中，其他机制也能促成小世界属性。基位物种从阳光和周围环境处获得能量和物质，但它们的捕食者通常仅能摄取它们体内资源的 10%，而在次第展开的每一步捕食中都是如此：如果食物链太长，顶端的捕食者便无法摄取足以维持其生存的资源。

无论最初怎样，当系统有了某种图形结构之时，小世界属性便成为需要考虑的重要特征。网络方法提供了这种系统的某种醒目景象：首先，系统的元素是某个大世界的一部分，其中几乎每个节点都具有彼此连接的路径；其次，这些路径非常短。这种交织的结构对理解从艾滋病到断电再到信息传播等存在的现象而言至关重要。

### 5.1 Hubs

In his memorable experiments on the ‘six degrees of separation’, Stanley Milgram made an observation that was going to be fully understood only much later. In one of his experiments, the US psychologist asked random citizens of Nebraska to forward a letter to a stockbroker in Massachusetts. If they did not know the recipient, they should send the letter to somebody that they believed to be closer to him. Beyond the fact that a large part of the letters arrived in an average of just six steps, Milgram observed that a quarter of them were delivered to the recipient from the very same source: a c steps away (friends of friendse ok2lothing merchant and friend of the stockbroker, whom Milgram calls Mr Jacobs. This result was quite mysterious: how was it that so many paths leading to the stockbroker passed through this person?

Frequent air travellers are familiar with a very similar phenomenon. Airports like Heathrow, Frankfurt or JFK in New York are well known to globetrotters: whatever the destination, it is quite likely that flights stop over at those airports. Airline magazines often carry a map of the world, crossed by long lines that show their routes: many of them end up at or pass through places like London, Frankfurt or New York. Airports like these are called hubs and carry a large portion of the overall traffic.

It’s easy to argue that the role of Mr Jacobs in the social network is the same as the big airports in the air traffic network. Probably, Jacobs was a social relations hub: his many contacts connected him to several people, so it was natural that many letters passed through his hands.

Another striking observation made by Milgram is that a large part of the remaining letters arrived from just two other people: Mr Jones and Mr Brown. Using the air traffic metaphor, these two people were most probably ‘average-size airports’ (like Madrid or Milan) of the social network. The remaining letters, that didn’t came from Jacobs, Jones, or Brown, passed through smaller ‘airports’ (like Girona or Olbia) of the social network.

The presence of these hubs is not specific to the stockbroker’s social network, or to the airport network. Many other systems, when represented as graphs, show similar highly connected vertices, or superconnectors. In many networks, one can see a ‘winner takes all’ tendency: a few nodes attract the majority of connections, and the large remainder of nodes have to share the remaining links. A modern analysis has shown that Mozart’s Don Giovanni (who seduced 2,065 women, according to Da Ponte’s libretto: ‘… 640 in Italy, 231 in Germany, 100 in France, 91 in Turkey, but in Spain they are already 1,003 …’) was not an exaggeration: the most connected individuals in sexual interaction networks can reach thousands of intercourses. In some datasets, some of these are people involved in the sex trade. Naturally, these highly connected individuals are those most needing protection against sexually transmitted diseases. Another example of superconnector was found early after the September 11 terrorist attack on New York: management consultant Valdis Krebs drew a simple map of the social networks of the terrorists and found that Mohammad Atta, one of the leaders of the conspiracy, was the most connected node, that is, a hub. In scientific collaboration networks, one can also find key figures that cooperate with a large number of colleagues: Paul Erd ő s was one of them.

Superconnectors are present in many kinds of network, not only in social ones. Some routers in the Internet have thousands of connections: that is, thousands more than the average router, which has just a few links. Meet-me rooms are large facilities — usually buildings full of cables — where hundreds of Internet Service Providers can link to each other: the failure of one of these facilities can leave entire areas as (as large as a state) without Internet connection. Websites of large newspapers attract an enormous number of links from other websites, blogs, and social networks. In foodwebs, top species predate a large quantity of other species. Finally in words’ networks, the hubs are the ambiguous or polysemic words: such as ‘arms’, which in English refers both to bodily extremities and weapons, and he quantity of trianglessH5Athus connects to a larger semantic or synonym field.

Hubs are also present in the networks inside the cell. In the genetic regulatory network, a single gene can control the expression of a large portion of the rest of the genome: in one bacterium (the Caulobacter crescentus), one single regulatory factor (the CtrA) controls 26 per cent of the cell cycle-regulated genes. The p53 molecule is a superconnector of the protein interaction network: the gene associated to this protein is a powerful tumor suppressor, and it is mutated in a large range of tumors. A clear hub of the metabolic network is the Atp molecule (adenosine triphosphate): this plays the role of energy carrier for a large number of biochemical reactions.

枢纽

在其令人印象深刻的「六度分隔理论」诸实验中，斯坦利·米尔格拉姆做了项很久之后人们才能充分理解的观察。其中ー个突验里，美国心理学家请一些随机挑选的内布拉斯加州公民转发一封信至马萨诸塞州的某股票经纪人。如果他们不认识收件人，就把信件寄送至那些他们认为与该经纪人更为接近的人。除了大部分信件平均仅用 6 步便抵达收件人处这一事实之外，米尔格拉姆还观察到，1/4 的信件经由同一个源头传递至收件人，即该股票经纪人的服装商朋友，米尔格拉姆称之为雅各布先生。这一结果令人相当费解：为何如此之多指向该股票经纪人的关系路径都要经过这位先生？

经常坐飞机的人对类似现象都很熟悉。希思罗、法兰克福或纽约肯尼迪等机场对于环球旅行者而言都耳熟能详：无论目的地是何处，飞机都很可能会停靠这些机场。航空杂志常常附有世界地图，纵横交错的长线标出飞行路线：其中许多航线都会途经伦敦、法兰克福以及纽约等地，或将其作为终点。像这样的机场被称为枢纽，它们承载了整个航空交通的大部分运力。我们很容易得出，雅各布先生在社交网络中的位置与这些大型机场在空中交通中的地位相同。很可能，雅各布就是一个社交关系枢纽：他的许多联系人将其与其他一些人相互连接，所以很自然地，许多信件都要经他发出。

米尔格拉姆另一个引人注目的观察是，剩余大部分信件经由另外两人寄达：琼斯先生和布朗先生。借用空中交通这个比喻，这两人最可能是社交网络中「一般规模的机场」（如马德里或米兰等机场）。而剩余那些并非来自雅各布、琼斯或布朗的信件则途经社交网络中的较小「机场」（如吉罗纳或奥尔比亚等机场）。

这些枢的存在并不局限于该股票经纪人的社交网络或者机场网络。在许多其他系统以图表示后，其中也能看到类似的高度连接顶点或超级连接器。在许多网络中，人们都能看到「胜者通吃」的趋势：少数几个节点能吸引大多数连接，而余下的大部分节点将不得不共享剩余连接。现代分析表明，莫扎特创作的唐·乔万尼（此人引诱了 2065 名女性，根据达蓬特的剧本在意大利 640 名，徳国 231 名，法国 100 名，土耳其 91 名，而西班牙境内已达 1003 名。）这一人物并非夸张：在性行为网络中与他人连接最多的个人的性行为可达数次。在一些数据集中，此类人中的一部分涉及性交易。自然地，这些与他人高度关联的个体最需要预防性传播疾病的感染。「9·11」恐怖袭击在约发生后不久，人们发现了超级连接器的又一例证：管理顾问瓦尔迪斯·克雷布斯画出了恐怖分子的社交网络简图，他发现这场阴谋的领导者之一穆罕默德·阿塔是连接最多的节点，即此人为该社交网络的枢纽。在科学合作网络中，我们也能发现那些与大量同行合作的关键人物：保罗·埃尔徳什便是其中之一。

除了社交网络，超级连接器还存在于各种各样的网络中。互联网中的某些路由器具有数干条连接：这比一般的路由器多出几千条，后者仅有少数几条连接。汇接机房乃大型设施 一一 通常为装满电缆的建筑物 一一 数百个互联网服务商可经由它彼此连接：这些设施只要有一处出现故障就能导致整个区域（大到一个国家）失去网络连接。大型报纸的网站吸引了大量来自其他网站、博客和社交网络的链接。而在食物网中，位于顶端的物种捕食其他大量物种。最后，语词网络中的枢则为模棱两可或多义的语词：比如 arms，它在英语中既指身体四肢也指武器，因而与更大的语义场或同义词域相连。

枢纽也存在于细胞内的网络中。在基因调控网络里，单个基因可以控制大部分剩余基因组的表达：在某种细菌（新月柄杆菌）中，一个调节因子（CtrA 基因）便可控制 26% 的细胞周期调节基因。p53 分子是蛋白质相互作用网络的超级连接器：与该蛋白质相关的基因是强大的瘤抑制基因，它会在大量的肿瘤里发生突变。代谢网络的枢很明显是 ATP 分子（腺三磷酸）：它在大量的生物化学反应中起到能量載体的作用。

### 5.2 Giants, Dwarfs, and Networks

And there came out from the camp of the Philistines a champion named Goliath of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span. […] He was armed with a coat of mail, and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of bronze […] The shaft of his spear was like a weaver’s beam, and his spear’s head weighed six hundred shekels of iron (1 Samuel 17 4:7)

According to the biblical book of Samuel, Israelites have to wait 40 days before someone dared to face somebody as imposing as Goliath: then enters David, a brave and reckless boy, who ends up defeating the enemy. This was not a common adversary: the ‘six cubits and a span’ height corresponds to about 3 metres, and the ‘five thousand shekels of bronze’ weight of his coat of mail would be between 60 and 90 kg, according to historians’ estimates.

The conversion of ancient measures into modern ones is not precise; moreover, the biblical narration is most probably symbolic. However, Goliath’s size is not completely unlikely. According to the Guinness Book of Records , the tallest person ever recorded, an American called Robert Wadlow, was 2.75 metres tall. Unlike Goliath, who has special armour and a spear suited to his size, the exceptionally tall are usually surrounded by objects too small for them: chairs are uncomfortable, ceilings are too low, and they need to wear specially tailored shoes and clothing.

The root of their problems is that body size is a homogeneous magnitude. People entering a cinema are of different sizes, but all the seats are identical: some people find them large, others small, but in general they are reasonably comfortable. Body size does not vary a lot from the average. Very tall (or very short) people are exceptionally rare, and the taller (or shorter) they are, the rarer. Almost everybody knows somebody about 1.90 metres tall, but few know a 2-metre tall person and almost nobody a 2.5-metre one. People are also homogeneous with respect to other features. For example, IQ tests yield results close to the average most of the times, and deviations — both upwards and downwards — are rare. Behaviours can be quite homogeneous, too. For example, drivers can be more or less reckless, but most of the time the speed measured on highways conforms quite closely to the average.

However, homogeneity is not always the rule. For example, the number of friends a person can have is extremely variable. Robert Wadlow was 'only' five times taller than the shortest person ever, Chandra Bahadur Dangi, 55 cm tall, according to the Guinness Book of Records. By contrast, the friendliest people (the hubs of social networks) can have tens or hundreds of friends more than the extremely one, who interact with very few individuals. If contacts in virtual social networks are taken as a proxy of the number of friends a person has, then the hubs of these networks have hundreds more friends than the less connected people. While height is a homogeneous magnitude, the number of social connection is a heterogeneous one.

If the height of people reflected the number of their social connections, somebody as tall as Wadlow would not enter any record book. There would be people hundreds of times taller than the shorter ones: ‘social giants’ more than 2 km tall would walk the streets. Even more interestingly, these giants would not be astounding exceptions in a generally short population. All the intermediate heights between dwarf and giant would be represented by some individuals: naturally, the greater the height, the fewer the people of that height; however, the number of tall people in this imaginary world would not diminish as quickly in terms of height as in the real world. In other words, the taller, the rarer: but not as rare as in the real world.

The business of seat manufacturers would be much more difficult in this world, because there would be no way to build a seat that would fit every body size. In the real world, if we want to manufacture seats, or analyse IQ tests, or predict the duration of a road trip, we take into account average height, IQ, or speed. But in order to understand social relations, the very concept of average may be useless. Body size, IQ, road speed, and other magnitudes have a characteristic scale : that is, an average value that in the large majority of cases is a rough predictor of the actual value that one will find. In contrast, social relations do not have this scale. If you knock on the door of an unknown neighbour, you expect to see a person whose height is within a certain reasonable range, and most of the time your guess will be accurate. But it is almost impossible to guess in advance whether that person has many or few friends, and how many. The average number of relationships in a town just gives an idea about whether the social network of that place is more or less dense. But it does not allow us to make any reasonable prediction about each single person. A system with this feature is said to be scale-free or scale-invariant , in the sense that it does not have a characteristic scale. This can be rephrased by saying that the individual fluctuations with respect to the average are too large for us to make a correct prediction.

巨人、侏儒和网络

从非利士营中出来一个讨战的名叫歌利亚的特人，身高六零一虎ロ。…..头戴盔，身穿铠甲，甲重五千客勒......铜戟枪杆粗如织布的机轴，铁枪头重六百客勒。

——《撒母耳记上》，17：4-7

根据《圣经》的《撤母耳记》，以色列人必须等待 40 天才有人敢于面对歌利亚那般强壮的人：随后大卫这个勇敢无畏的男孩进来了，他最终击败敌人。歌利亚并非寻常敌人「六肘零一虎ロ」的身高相当于大约 3 米高，而根据历史学家的推测，他身上「五千舍客勒」的铠甲也重达 60-90 公斤。

古代计量换算为现代计量时并不是很精确；而且，《圣经》的记述很可能是象征性的。然而，歌利亚的身高不是完全没有可能。根据《吉尼斯世界纪录》，有记录的最高者为一个名叫罗伯特·瓦德洛的美国人，此人身高 2.75 米。与歌利亚有着特制的盔甲和适合其身高的矛不同，特别高的人周围的物体与之相比都太过短小：椅子不舒服，天花板太低，他们还需要穿特制的鞋子和衣服。

他们的问题根源在于，身体尺寸是一种「同质」量值。进入电影院的人有着不同的身高，但所有的座椅都一样：有些人觉得椅子大了，其他人觉得小了，但一般而言，他们都觉得还算舒服。身体尺寸不会偏离平均尺寸太多。很高（或很矮）的人非常罕见，越高（或越矮）的人则越少见。几乎每个人都认识 1.9 米高的人，但仅有少数人认识 2 米高的人，而几乎没有人认识身高 2.5 米的人。人们在其他一些特征上也具有同质量值。例如，人们的智商测试结果多数时候接近平均水平，而偏差 一一 无论往上还是向下ー则较为罕见。人们的行为方式也十分同质化。比如，司机可能多少都有些莽撞，但经测量多数时候他们在高速公路上的行驶速度都非常接近平均水平。

然而，同质性并非金科玉律。例如，一个人的朋友数量是极度多变的。根据《吉尼斯世界纪录》，瓦德洛的身高仅是最矮的人的五倍，后者名为钱德拉·巴哈杜尔·唐吉，身高 55 厘米。相比之下，最友好的人（即社交网络中的枢）所交的朋友数比那些仅与很少人交往的极度害羞之人要多出数十上百个。如果将虚拟社交网络中的联系人也算入一个人的朋友之中，那么这些网络的枢纽人物会比那些不善交往的人多出数百个朋友。人们的身高属于「同质」量值，但社交关系的数量却是「异质」的。

1-2『同质对应于正态分布（身高），异质对应于幕律分布（社交数量）。这里的异质引出了「无标度」的概念，即系统不具备特征尺度。无标度做一张术语卡片。（2021-02-16）』——已完成

如果人的身高反映了他们社交关系的数量，那么，像瓦德洛这么高的人不会进入任何世界纪录。社交关系中会有比矮子高出几百倍的人：身高超过两公里的「社交巨人」会行走在社交之路上。更有趣的是，这些巨人在普遍矮小的人群中并不会是惊人的。例外。侏儒和巨人之间的所有中间高度将由另一些人代表：自然，高度越高，人数越少；然而，这个想象世界里的高个子数量不会像在现实世界中那样迅速少。换句话说，越高越少，但也不至于像在现实世界中那般稀有。

在这个想象世界中，座椅制造商的业务难度会增大许多，因为没法制造一个适合每个人身体尺寸的座位。而在现实世界里，如果想制造座椅、分析智商测试或预测自驾旅程的时长，我们会考虑平均身高、智商或行车速度。但为了理解社会关系，平均的概念就显得无用了。身体尺寸、智商、行车速度以及其他量值都具备特征尺度，即大多数情况下的平均值都是对我们所发现的实际值的大致预测。相比之下，社交关系并不具备这种尺度。如果去敲一个陌生邻居的门，你预计看见之人的身高会在一个合理的范围之内，而你的猜测多数时候是准确的。但我们几乎不可能提前猜测此人朋友数量的多寡以及具体数字。某个城镇的平均人际关系数量仅能让我们了解该地区社交网络的密程度。但我们无法据此对每个个人做出任何合理的预测。具备这种特征的系统被认为是无标度或标度不变的，意为该系统并不具备特征尺度。这句话还可以这样表述，相较于平均值，个体波动太大，以至于我们无法做出正确的预测。

### 5.3 Fat Tails

In general, a network with heterogeneous connectivity has a set of clear hubs. When a graph is small, it is easy to find whether its connectivity is homogeneous or heterogeneous (Figure 8). In the first case, all the nodes have more or less the same connectivity, while in the latter it is easy to spot a few hubs. But when the network to be studied is very big (like the Internet, the Web, metabolic networks, and many others) things are not so easy. Fortunately, mathematics provides a way to find whether a magnitude is heterogeneous or homogeneous.

8 A homogeneous network (left), where all nodes have more or less the same degree, compared with a heterogeneous one (right), where highly connected nodes (hubs) are present

Let us start with a homogeneous magnitude, such as people’s height. In order to study the height of the students of a class, one can do as follows. First, make a row with those 1.50 to 1.55 metres tall: there will be a few of them. Then, make a parallel row with those 1.55 to 1.60: there will be some more and the row will be a little longer. For of the follow those with 1.60 to 1.65: more people will be in that row. Increasing by 5 centimetres in every row (Figure 9 left). At the end, the profile of the rows will have the shape of a bell curve : the number of students increases as height increases, then reaches the top around the average, and then starts to fall. The very tall and the very short are rare and the majority are in the middle. This curve provides the distribution of heights of the students.

Now, let us consider the number of social contacts of those same students. Now the rows correspond to those with 0 to 20 friends, 20 to 40, 40 to 60, and so on. The outcome of this procedure provides the distribution of the connectivity of the nodes of the social network, that is, the degree distribution of the graph. The resulting picture is very different from the case of heights (Figure 9 right). First of all, there will be many more rows, since there will be people with hundreds or thousands of friends. The majority of people will have some tens of contacts per person, but the resulting distribution will have a ‘fat tail’. In other words, the distribution will be very skewed to the right, with a long or ‘heavy tail’. Mathematically speaking, the shape of the degree distribution is well described by a curve called power law.

9 Height is a homogeneous magnitude, distributed according to a bell curve (left), while the number of friends is a heterogeneous magnitude, distributed according to a power law (right)

In homogeneous networks, the degree distribution is a bell curve, similar to that of height, while in heterogeneous networks, it is a power law, similar to that of friendships. The power law implies that there are many more hubs (and much more connected) in heterogeneous networks than in homogeneous ones. Moreover, hubs are not isolated exceptions: there is a full hierarchy of nodes, each of them being a hub compared with the less connected ones. Take once again the comparison of height and friendships. Probably there are several million people in the world who are 1.50 metres tall; however, if we double that height (3.00 metres), the number of people this tall is much smaller, most probably zero. On the other hand, tens of millions of people have, say, 20 friends in their social network. If we double that number (40 friends), there will be fewer (say a quarter of those with 20), but still millions. We can double the number many times, and the number will be reduced by about a quarter at every step (the actual rate of reduction depends on the slope of the power law). This explains, for example, the role of Mr Jones and Mr Brown in Milgram’s experiment: while Jacobs is the largest hub of the stockbroker’s social network, Jones and Brown are smaller hubs, but still well connected.

Looking at the degree distribution is the best way to check if a network is heterogeneous or not: if the distribution is fat tailed, then the network will have hubs and heterogeneity. A mathematically perfect power law is never found, because this would imply the existence of hubs with an infinite number of connections. However, no real network is infinitely big: this is why the fat tail of the degree distribution always has a cut-off at a maximum value for the degree. Indeed, the size of hubs can be limited by various costs of accumulating connections: for example, neurons cannot accumulate an arbitrary amount of connections, because of their physical and now represents a wide variety of topics in history, philosophy, religion, science, and the humanities. The VSI ve of the structure. In professional collaboration networks, time plays a role: connections cannot be accumulated indefinitely, because at a certain moment the career (or life) of an individual comes to an end. All these and other factors are reflected in the shape of the degree distribution. Nonetheless, a strongly skewed, fat-tailed distribution is a clear signal of heterogeneity, even if it is never a perfect power law.

One has to be careful in interpreting what hubs and fat tails mean. For example, some anthropologists believe that a magnitude called Dunbar number limits the number of social relations. According to this hypothesis the number of stable social bonds cannot increase much above 150. Anthropologist Robin Dunbar put forward this hypothesis in 1992 after finding evidence that the size of a part of the brain’s cortex of primates and humans may be related to that of their social groups. If this is true, what is the explanation of the hubs with thousands of connections found in many social networks? Some scientists think that they are instances of the pizza delivery guy problem. A pizza delivery guy receives many phone calls on his mobile, but just a tiny fraction of them come from real friends; the rest are clients. According to this concept, the majority of the links represented in the fat tail of the distribution would be fictitious in social networks. However, this depends on exactly what problem one wants to study. For example, if the pizza delivery guy catches flu, epidemiologists only care about how many people (friends or not) have been in contact with him.

On the other hand, not all networks are necessarily heterogeneous. While the small-world property is something intrinsic to networked structures, hubs are not present in all kind of networks. For example, power grids usually have very few of them. The same holds for some foodwebs, the neuronal network of the C. elegans , and the World Trade Web.

Finally, an interesting case is found in some directed networks, as in the case of, most genetic regulatory networks. If gene A regulates gene B, an arrow is drawn from A to B, but not necessarily from B to A. The out-degree distribution (that is, the distribution of the number of outcoming arrows) is usually fat tailed: that is, a few genes regulate large portions of the genome. However, the in-degree distribution (that of the number of incoming arrows) is much more homogeneous: just a few other genes regulate a single one. Heterogeneity is widespread in many networks, but when we approach an unknown system we must not take it for granted until we have checked it.

肥尾效应

一般而言，具备异质连接性的网络都会有一组清晰的中心。当图很小时，我们很容易发现其内部连接是同质还是异质的（图 8）。在第一种情況下，所有节点多少具备相同的连接性，而在后者中则很容易发现少量枢纽节点。但是，当被研究的网络非常大（如互联网、万维网、代谢网络以及许多其他网络）时，事情就没那么简单了。幸运的是，数学提供了一种方法来确定一种量值是同质还是异质。

图 8 与存在高度连接节点（枢纽节点）的异质网络（右）相比，同质网络（左）中所有节点的度数大致相同

1-2『判断同质还是异质的数学方法：同质网络中所有节点的「度数」大致相同。另外一种表述形式：同质的数据符合正态分布模型，异质的数据符合幕律分布模型。做一张主题卡片。（2021-02-16）』——已完成

我们以同质量值为起点，比如人的身高。为了研究某班学生的身高，我们可以按照以下方法操作。首先，让那些身高在 1.50 到 1.55 米之间的学生排成一列：他们可能人数不多。然后，让那些身高在 1.55 到 1.60 米之间的学生平行地排成一列：这些人的数量会多些，队伍也会长些。接下来的一列为 1.60 到 1.65 米的学生：更多的人会出现在这一列。然后，每一列身高增加 5 厘米（图 9 左）。最后，这些列的轮廓将构成钟形曲线的形状：

学生的数量随着身高的增加而增加，然后在平均值附近达到峰值，接着开始下降。很高和很矮的学生都较少，大部分处于中间范围。这条曲线提供了学生的身高分布。

图 9 人们的身高为同质量值，钟形线分有（左），而人们的朋友数量则为异质量值，呈律分布（右）

现在，我们来考虑这些学生的社交关系数量。这时，每一列分别对应 0 到 20 个朋友，20 到 40 个朋友，40 到 60 个朋友，以此类推。该过程的结果提供了社交网络节点的连接性分布，即图的度数分布。这个结果图与身高图的情况十分不同（图 9 右）。首先，图中的列会更多，因为有的人的朋友数量会成百上千。多数人的联系人为几十个，但由此产生的分布将具有「肥尾效应」。换言之，分布图的长尾或者说是「厚尾」将明显向右偏斜。从数学角度讲，度数分布的形状可通过幂律得到很好的描述。

在同质网络中，度数分布是类似于前述学生身高的钟形曲线，而在异质网络里，度数分布则遵循幂律，类似于朋友数量的分布图。幂律意昧着异质网络中存在着比同质网络更多的枢组节点（以及更多的连接数）。此外，枢节点并不是单独的例外：与连接数较少的网络相比，连接数较多的网络中有着完整的节点层级结构，每个节点都构成了一个枢纽。

再拿身高和朋友数量来说。世界上身高 1.50 米的人可能有数百万；然而，如果我们将这一高度翻倍（3 米），如此高度的人则少得多，很可能没有。另一方面，数干万人在其社交网络中有比如说 20 位朋友。如果我们将这个数字加倍（40 位朋友）拥有这个朋友数的人数则会少些（比如比加倍之前人数减少了 1/4）, 但仍有数百万。我们可将这个数字多次加倍，而对应的人数则每次减少约 1/4（实际少的速度取決于幂律的斜率）。这便解释了比如琼斯先生和布朗先生在米尔格拉姆实验中的作用：虽然雅各布是股票经纪人社交网络中的最大枢纽而琼斯和布朗是更小的枢纽，但与他们联系的人依然很多。

查看度数分布是检查网络是否为异质结构的最佳方法：如果度数分布呈肥尾，则该网络将有多个枢纽且为异质结构。人们从未发现某种数学上完美的幂律，因为这将意味着存在拥有无限连接数的枢纽。然而，不存在无限大的真实网络：这就是为何度数分布的肥尾总有一个度数最大值上限的原因。实际上，枢纽的大小会受到连接累积的各种成本的限制：例如，由于神经元的物理结构，神经元无法累积任意数量的连接。在专业协作网络中，时间起着某种作用：连接数无法无限累积，因为个体的事业（或生命）会在某个时刻终结。所有这些和其他因素都反映在度数分布的形状上。尽管如此，严重偏斜的肥尾状度数分布仍是异质网络的清楚信号，即便它从来都不是一个完美的幂律。

在解释枢纽和肥尾的含义时必须小心谨慎。例如，一些人类学家认为，一种叫邓巴数字的量值限制了人们的社交关系数量。根据这一假设，稳定的社交关系数量不能超过 150 这个数字太多。人类学家罗宾·邓巴在发现灵长类动物和人类的大脑皮质某部分的大小可能与它们的社会群组规模相关的证据之后，于 1992 年提出这一假设。如果这一假设为真，那又如何解释人们在许多社交网络中发现的有着上干联系人的社交枢纽呢？

一些科学家认为，这便是「披萨送货员问题」的实例。披萨送货员在自己的手机上会接到许多电话，但只有极少的一部分来自其真正的朋友；其余则为客户。根据这种想法，呈现在社交网络度数分布图肥尾处的多数连接都是泛泛之交。然而，这还得看人们究竟想研究什么问题。例如，如果披萨送货员得了流感，流行病学家只会关心有多少人（不管是不是朋友）曾与他有过接触。

另一方面，并非所有网络都是异质结构。尽管小世界属性是网络结构所固有的，但不是所有的网络中都会出现枢纽。例如，电网通常就仅有少量枢纽。还有一些食物网、线虫的神经网络以及世界贸易网络等都很少有枢纽存在。

最后，人们在一些有向网络中发现了一个有趣的情況，正如在多数基因调控网络中发现的那样。如果基因 A 调控基因 B，则箭头从 A 指向 B，但 B 不是一定要指向 A。出度分布（即朝外箭头数的分布）通常是肥尾状：少数基因调控大部分基因组。然而，入度分布（即朝内箭头数的分布）则均匀得多：少数其他基因调控某个基因。异质性在许多网络中都广泛存在，但当我们处理未知系统时，在检验之前我们不要理所当然地认为它就是异质网络。

### 5.4 The Signature of self-organization

Heterogeneity and the lack of characteristic scale may very well be a sign of disorder. One could reason as follows. Many networks (like the Internet or social networks) have grown without any blueprint or supervision. As a consequence, every node in the network follows its own criteria and performs completely different and uncoordinated behaviours. These are so disordered that they can be easily assimilated to an overall random process. As a consequence, random graphs should be good models for these networks. This line of reasoning seems to work, but some problems appear after deeper inspection. The most noticeable is that random networks are not heterogeneous at all. On the contrary, their degree distribution is bell shaped, suggesting that all nodes have more or less the same degree. The process of connecting pairs at random is such that every node ends up with more or less the same degree. More precisely, the degree has a characteristic scale, with small fluctuations around the average. In contrast with many real-world networks, hubs are not present in random networks.

A consequence of this is that, while random networks are small worlds, heterogeneous ones are ultra-small worlds. That is, the distance between their vertices is relatively smaller than in their random counterparts. If one takes a random network and adds a certain number of hubs to it (thus making it more heterogeneous), then the distance becomes smaller. Conversely, if one takes a heterogeneous network and randomizes it (that is, builds a network with the same number of nodes and edges, but with edges distributed at random), then hubs disappear, and the average distance becomes larger. This shows that hubs are responsible for the majority of the connectivity of these networks: a large portion of the connections arise precisely from this small number of superconnected nodes.

More importantly, the fact that random networks are homogeneous means that the equivalence between heterogeneity and disorder is flawed. A disordered process such as the one described by random networks does not yield the heterogeneous connectivity found in many real-world networks. On the contrary, heterogeneity may arise from the exact opposite: that is, from some kind of regular, ordered behaviour.

This is rather puzzling, since many networks are not the result of a blueprint, nor do they evolve under tight top-down supervision. Few networks, like the electrical or road ones, are controlled by political and technical authorities, but most of them are unsupervised. The Internet, for example, is controlled by network administrators at the local level, and is also constrained by technical, economic, and geographic features. However, its large-scale structure is largely unplanned: the Internet is very similar to a global-scale experiment, where nobody draws the overall structure, which is the result of the actions of innumerable agents. Biological networks are an even clearer example: there is no designer, only the tinkering effects of evolution. With respect to social networks, politics, money, religion, language, and culture influence the relations between individuals, but when spaces of fre number of cou

自组织的标志

异质性和特征尺度的缺乏可能是无序的极好标志。推论如下。许多网络（比如互联网或社交网络）是在没有任何蓝图或监督的情况下成长起来的。因此，网络中的每个节点都遵循其自身的标准，并表现出彼此完全不同和不协调的行为。这些节点十分混乱，以至于它们很容易就被某种总体无序的过程所同化。因此，随机图应该成为这些网络的良好模型。这种推理似乎有效，但若深入检验，一些问题便出现了。最明显的是，随机网络根本不是异质结构。相反，它们的度数分布为钟形结构，这表明所有节点都有着大致相同的度数。随机关联节点的过程便是如此，即每个节点最终都有着同样的度数。更确切地说，度数具有特征尺度，且在平均值附近小幅波动。与许多真实的网络相比，随机网络中不存在枢纽节点。

其结果是，随机网络为小世界，而异质网络则是超小世界。也就是说，异质网络顶点间的距离小于其随机对照网络中的相应距离。如果人们在一个随机网络中加入一定数量的枢纽节点（因而使其更具异质结构），则节点之间的距离会变小。相反，如果人们将一个异质网络随机化（即用相同数量的点和边建构一个网络，但让边随机分布），枢节点便会消失，节点之间的平均距离也会変大。这表明枢组节点承担了这些网络中的大多数连接：这些连接中的大部分正是从这些少数的超级连接点中产生的。

更重要的是，随机网络为同质结构这一事实意着异质并不完全等同于无序。如前述随机网络那般的无序过程并不会产生那些在现实网络中所发现的异质连接。相反，异质性可能恰恰来自其对立面，即来自某种规则的有序行为。

1『异质对应于（意味）有序。大赞。（2021-02-16）』

这一点十分令人困惑，因为许多网络都不是设计的结果，也并非是在自上而下的严格监管中发展起来的。像电网或道路网络等少数网络由政治和技术权威控制，但大多数网络则无人监管。例如，互联网由地方一级的网络管理员控制，并且也受到技术、经济和地理特征的限制。然而，其大规模的结构在很大程度上则是未经筹划的：互联网非常类似于一项全球规模的实验，其中没人提出整体结构，而是靠无数代理人的行动将其建立。生物网络是一个更为清晰的例子：它没有设计者，仅有进化提供修补效果。社交网络、政治、金钱、宗教、语言和文化都会对个人之间的关系产生影响，但是当个人关系存在自由空间的时候，这些网络的形成便不再是严格规划的。在所有这些情况下，系统的整体组织产生于其组成部分的集体行为，即某种自下而上的自组织过程。这个过程可以解释为何许多网络即便没有规划，却仍然显示出异质性这样明显的有序标志。

异质性并非网络系统所独有。例如，地震强度便有肥尾状的分布特征，而如果人们绘制出地震频率与其强度的对比图，它便会呈现出很好的幂律分布。「平均强度的地震」并不存在，其中有很大的多性，从无法察觉的震动到大规模的灾难。另一个例子是城市的规模；其范围从中国最大的大都会到托斯卡纳的小镇不等。还有就是收入分配：20 世纪初，经济学家维尔弗雷多·帕累托指出意大利 80% 的土地掌握在 20% 的人手中。所有经济体中都存在不同程度的此种不均衡。

所有这些例子与网络共有一个基本特征：它们都是复杂且大体上无监管进程的结果。异质性并不等同于随机性。相反，异质性可能成为某种隐藏有序结构的标志，它并非某种自上而下的计划，而是由系统的所有元素共同作用而产生。这个特征在大范围不同网络中的出现表明，在许多这种网络中，可能有着某种共同的底层机制在起作用。了解这种自组织秩序的起源则是网络科学面临的核心挑战之一。

## 0601. Emergence of Networks

网络的涌现

### 6.1 Everlasting Change

By the nineties, the Internet was mostly an unknown land. Although it was already a critical infrastructure for communication, trading, and transportation, nobody had a clear idea about its overall architecture. Administrators controlled local networks, but had no clue about the large-scale structure of the net. Moreover, the increase had been explosive: from some tens of machines at the beginning of the seventies, to tens of millions, with even larger prospects of growth. By the end of the decade, organizations like the computer company Compaq and the Cooperative Association for Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA) launched a series of mapping projects , aimed at exploring the Internet and drawing its global layout. Compaq’s project was called Mercator , in honour of the geographer that drew in the 16th century one of the the most important maps of the world, including the recently discovered America: the Internet was acknowledged to be a ‘new world’ to be explored. Thanks to these and other projects, maps of the Internet are available, and its growth is now monitored.

The dynamics of the Internet have not stopped: at this very moment, routers, computers, cables, and satellite connections are constantly being added or removed, with the net effect of continuous growth. Despite the absence of a plan, this is not a completely random process. On the contrary, the Internet is a highly ordered and efficient structure. This emerging order must be the result of some regularity in the behaviour of individual agents that build the Net. There must be some small-scale mechanism that, iterated through a great number of interactions, ends up generating a structure that is organized at the large-scale level. Disentangling the general principles underlying those processes that shape network structures is essential to understanding their self-organization.

Even networks seeming to be completely static are subject in fact to some kind of dynamic process. The networks of genes, proteins, and metabolites in the cell, those of neurons in the brain, and those of species in the ecosystem, seem to be fixed in time: genetic regulation, metabolic pathways, neuron connections, or prey–predator relations are relatively stable. However, the networks within the cell live an explosive growth during the development of each individual and are constantly changing as the organism ages, and in reaction to the environment. The plasticity of the brain may decrease throughout life, but it is never completely lost. Extinctions or invasions of new species radically reshape foodwebs. Moreover, all biological nets change in the long run, for the action of natural evolution. Something similar happens in other apparently static networks, such as power grids or language networks. After power grids are set up, they slowly modify their shape due to accidents and technological evolution. The network of words changes as speakers change, and as the overall language evolves, introducing neologisms and new semantic relations.

In other networks, the change is mostly concentrated in the connections, while the set of vertices is almost immutable. For example, every day the banks of a given country set up a Three different representations of the same graph" aid="trad different pattern of money lending, in the interbank network. Occasionally, the set of vertices of this network can change, for example if a bank goes bankrupt or if a new one appears on the market. However, this change happens on a much longer timescale than the transactions (i.e. the rearrangement of edges): on a given day, the changes in the networks are mainly associated to the edges. Something similar happens in the networks of price correlations between stocks (correlation varies much more frequently than the actual set of stocks), in the World Trade Web (changes in economic relations between countries of the world are more common than the creation of new countries, through separation or federation), and in the airport network (in any one year, only a few new airports open, while a great number of flight connections change).

Exactly the opposite happens in another group of networks: in these graphs, new nodes are constantly added, and this process is much more relevant than the rearrangement of links. The most exact realization of this case is the network of citations within scientific papers. New papers appear every day, with citations to older ones, and once they are published, the respective citations cannot be changed any more.

Finally, there are networks where the dynamics of adding (or eliminating) nodes and connections happen at the same rate, giving place to a quite complicated process. The Web is constantly updated with creation and deletion of both new web pages and new hyperlinks. On some specific websites, such as Wikipedia, new articles and new connections between articles are created every day.

The range of possible network dynamics is extremely wide: network scientists have made measures, mathematical models, and computer simulations in order to grasp the basic mechanisms underlying this process, in the hope of understanding the principles of self-organization of these networks.

永恒的变化

到 20 世纪 90 年代，互联网很大程度上还是一个未知的领域。尽管它已经成为通信、贸易和运输的关键基础设施，但没人清楚地知道其整体架构。管理员控制着本地网络，但他们并不清楚互联网的大规模结构。此外，互联网呈爆炸式增长：从 70 年代初的几十台机器到上千万台，且增长前景更为广阔。到 90 年代末，像康柏电脑公司（compaq）和互联网数据分析合作协会这样的组织启动了一系列绘图计划，旨在探索互联网并描绘其全球布局。康柏公司的计划名为「墨卡托」，以此纪念在 16 世纪绘制了最为重要的世界地图之一的地理学家，该地图将刚被发现的美洲大陆包含在内 一一 而互联网被认为是一个尚待探索的「新世界」。多亏了这些以及其他项目，互联网地图才得以成为可能，它的增长现已受到监控。

但互联网的动态并未停止：此时此刻，路由器、计算机、电缆和卫星连接都仍在不断被添加或移除，这帯来了持续増长的净效应。尽管缺乏规划，但互联网的增长过程也并非完全随机。相反，互联网是一种高度有序和高效的结构。这种涌现的秩序一定是构建网络之个体行为的某种规则性的后果。小规模的机制也必定存在，它们经由大量的交互送代过程，最终产生了一种在大规模层面井然有序的结构。而解开隐含于网络结构形成过程之下的基本原理，对理解这些网络结构的自组织进程而言至关重要。

甚至那些看起来完全静止的网络，实际上也在进行着某种动态过程。细胞中的基因、蛋白质和代谢物所构成的网络，大脑中的神经网络以及生态系统中的物种网络等等，它们似乎都固定不变：基因调控、代谢途径、神经元连接或猎物-捕食者关系都相对稳定。然而，细胞内的网络在每个个体的发育期间呈爆炸式增长，并且随着生物体的老化及其对环境的应变过程而不断变化。大脑的可塑性在整个生命过程中可能会下降，但它并不会完全消失。物种灭绝或新物种入侵则会彻底重食物网。此外，所有生物网络在长期内都会因为自然选择的作用而发生改变。类似的事情还发生在其他明显的静态网络中，例如电网或语言网络。电网建成之后，由于事故和技术发展，它们会慢慢调整自身的形状。语词网络则随着说话者的改变而改变，并且，随着语言整体的演变，新词和新的语义关系也会被引入。

在其他网络中，变化主要集中在连接上，而顶点集合几乎不可改变。例如，某一国家的银行每天都会在银行同业网络中建立不同的借款模式。偶尔，该网络的顶点集合也能发生改变，比如在银行破产或者新的银行出现在市场上之时。然而，这种变化发生在比交易（即边的重新排列）更长的时间段内：在给定的一天中，网络中的变化主要与边相关。类似的事情不仅发生在股票间的价格相关性网络中（相关性的变化比实际的股票组频繁得多），也发生在世界贸易网络中（世界各国经济关系的变化比新的国家通过分离或联合而建立更为普遍），还有机场网络中（不管在哪都仅有少数新机场开张，而大量航线则处于变化之中）。

完全相反的情况则出现在另外一组网络中：在这些图中，新节点被不断添加进来，而这一进程比连线的重新排列重要得多。这种情况最确切的实例是科学论文中的引用网络。引用较早论文的新论文每天都会出现，一发表，相应的引用关系便无法再次更改。

最后，在一些网络中，添加（或減少）节点和连线的动力会以相同的速度发生，并让位于一个相当复杂的过程。万维网以创建和删除网页和新超级链接的方式不断更新。在维基百科这样的特定网站中，每天都会有新文章和文章间的新链接被创建出来。可能的网络动力的范围十分广泛：网络科学家已经制定了各种衡量标准、数学模型和计算机模拟，以掌握这一过程背后的基本机制，以期理解这些网络的自组织原理。

### 6.2 The Rich Get Richer

At the beginning of the sixties, sociologist Harriet Zuckerman interviewed a number of scientists who had received the Nobel Prize. She aimed at finding what was so special in their way of working, and what the secret of their success in research was. She found a recurring theme in the answers of the Nobelists. A laureate in physics said: ‘The world is peculiar in this matter of how it gives credit. It tends to give the credit to [already] famous people.’ A laureate in chemistry added: ‘When people see my name on a paper, they are apt to remember it , and not to remember the other names.’ And a laureate in physiology and medicine specified: ‘[When you read a scientific paper] you usually notice the name that you’re familiar with. Even if it’s last it will be the one that sticks […] You remember that, rather than the long list of authors.’ ‘The man who’s best known gets more credit, an inordinate amount of credit,’ concluded a laureate in physics.

Those observations led another sociologist (and later husband of Zuckerman), Robert Merton, to formulate in 1968 a brilliant law. Merton put forward that science is under the effect of a social mechanism dubbed the Matthew effect. The name comes from the Gospel of Matthew:

For to all those who have, more will be given, and they will have in abundance; but from those who have nothing, even what they have will be taken away (Mt, 25:29).

According to Merton, this mechanism plays a role in the distribution of prizes, financing, visibility, prestige … Scientists with a good number of these assets acquire even more of them with ease. On the other hand, those without them have a hard tim they did not know the recipient, th De acquiring and retaining them.

In 1976, physicist and science historian Derek de Solla Price found quantitative evidence that supported this view. Price analysed a large set of scientific papers, linked by mutual citations. He found that papers with a good number of citations at a particular time tended to acquire even more citations later, while those that had only a few at the beginning did not increase their citations that much. Price showed mathematically that this simple rule could explain the appearance of highly cited papers (hubs of the citation network). More precisely, he showed that this mechanism could explain why the distribution of the number of citations per paper displayed the characteristic fat tail of a power law.

Price’s model was a variant of mathematical models developed earlier by statistician George Udny Yule and social scientist Herbert A. Simon, but it was not until 1999 that it became clear that this mechanism could explain the appearance of hubs, heterogeneity, scale-invariance, in synthesis of fat-tailed distributions, in a set of different networks. This realization is due to physicists Albert-László Barabási and Réka Albert. Barabási and Albert put forward a mathematical model of the growth of a network. They imagined a graph that starts with a small set of vertices (even just two or three), connected at random. New nodes are added at a steady rate to this initial nucleus, each of them carrying a given number of links. A simple rule establishes how new nodes are linked: incoming vertices prefer old ones that already have many links. This mechanism is called preferential attachment (Figure 10). In principle, new vertices can attach to any of the old ones, but the higher the degree of an old node, the higher the probability of attracting a new one. Occasionally, less connected nodes will receive new links, but most of the time hubs will be much more attractive.

10 In the preferential attachment mechanism for network growth, new nodes connect preferentially with old nodes that have a high degree

This process can be studied mathematically and simulated on computer, and one can take measurements in real networks to see whether it is at work or not. At the beginning, all the nodes have more or less the same degree. However, during growth, some of them start to accumulate more links than others. The more connections a node has at a certain moment, the more it is capable of attracting new connections. This is why the preferential attachment is also called the rich-get-richer mechanism. As a consequence, the initially small differences in connectivity are progressively amplified. Thus, a hierarchy of different nodes emerges, with a large variety in their degrees, ranging from the least connected ones to those that have accumulated many links, i.e. the hubs. The resulting network is heterogeneous, with a power-law degree distribution.

The Barabási–Albert model shows that a bottom-up mechanism of growth can generate heterogeneity, without imposing any top-down blueprint. The global scale-invariance of the network is the outcome of the iteration of an individual, local choice: preferring more connected nodes to less connected ones. The model uses probability to allow for individual deviations from this behaviour: some nodes can decide to connect to low-degree nodes. However, the general tendency sets the outcome. As a further confirmation, one can check that the heterogeneity of the network disappears if it is grown they did not know the recipient, th D without the preferential attachment rule. Indeed, new nodes connect to old ones at random, in such a way that the degree of old nodes does not influence their capacity to attract new links; the outcome is a homogeneous network in which every node ends up having more or less the same degree.

富者更富

20 世纪 60 年代初，社会学家哈丽雅特·朱克曼采访了一批获得诺贝尔奖的科学家，其目的是找到这些人工作方式中的独特之处，以及他们研究工作成功的秘诀。她在这些诺奖获得者的回答中发现了ー个反复出现的主题。一位诺贝尔物理学奖获得者说：「在授予荣誉这件事上这个世界很奇怪。它往往将荣誉给予那些（已经）出名的人。」一位诺贝尔化学奖获得者补充道：「当人们在报纸上看见我的名字，他们往往会记住它，而忽略其他人名。」而一位生理学和医学奖获得者则具体谈道：「当你在读一篇科学文献时，你常常注意到你熟悉的名字。即便排到最后，它也会让人印象深刻。你会记住它，而非长长的著者名单。」「最出名的人会获得更多的声誉，在程度上无节制的声誉。」物理学奖获得者如此总结道。

这些观察促使另一位社会学家（朱克曼后来的丈夫）罗伯特·顿于 1968 年提出了一个出色的定理。默顿提出，科学处于马太效应这种社会机制的影响之下。这个名字来自《马太福音》：

凡有的，还要加给他，叫他有余；没有的，连他所有的也要夺过来。

依照默顿的观点，这种机制在奖项、资助、关注度、声望等的分配中起着一定的作用。拥有大量此类资产的科学家可以轻松获得更多的类似资产。另一方面，那些缺乏者想要获取或保持这些资产就十分困难。

1976 年，物理学家和科学史家德里克·德·索拉·普菜斯发现了支持这种观点的量化证据。普莱斯分析了大量因相互引用而彼此关联的科学文献。他发现，在特定时期内被大量引用的文献往往也会在之后获得更多引用，而那些一开始仅被少量引用的文献后来也未増加多少被引数。普莱斯从数学上证明了这个简单的法则能够解释高引文献（即引用网络的枢纽节点）出现的原因。更确切地说，他证明了这种机制能够解释为何每篇文章的引用数量分布显示出了幂律的肥尾特征。

普莱斯的模型是统计学家乔治·尤德里·尤尔和社会科学家赫伯特·A.西蒙早前开发的数学模型的变体，但是人们直到 1999 年才明白，这种机制可以解释网络枢纽、异质性、标度不变性在不同网络中整体以肥尾分布出现的原因。该模型的实现归功于物理学家奥尔贝特-拉斯洛·巴拉巴西和雷卡·奥尔贝特。巴拉巴西和奥尔贝特提出了网络增长的数学模型。他们设想了一个始于少量顶点（甚至仅有两三个）随机连接的图形。新的节点以稳定的速度加入到这个原初的核心中，每个节点都带有给定数量的连接简单的规则确定了新节点是如何连接的：新节点会偏好已有许多连接的旧节点。这种机制又称优先连接（图 10）。原则上，新节点可以加入任何日节点之上，但日节点的度数越高，它吸引新节点的概率便越高。偶尔，连接较少的节点也会接入新的连接，但大多数时候却是枢纽节点更具吸引力。

图 10 在网络増长的优先连接机制中，新节点会优先连接度数高的旧节点

这一过程可从数学上加以研究，并能在计算机上进行模拟，人们可以测量真实的网络以确定其是否在起作用。一开始，所有节点多少都具备相同的度数。然而，随着节点的增长，有一些开始累积比其他节点更多的连接。某节点在特定时刻所具备的连接越多，它便越能够吸引新连接。这也是为何优先连接原则又被称为富者更富机制的原因。结果，连接性最初的小小差异会逐渐放大。因此，不同节点的层级结构便出现了，其中节点的度数差异极大，从连接最少的节点到那些累积了众多连接的枢纽不一而足。最后得到的网络具有异质性，且呈幂律度数分布。

巴拉巴西-奥尔贝特模型证明了，自下而上的增长机制能够产生异质性，而不用强加任何自上而下的设计。网络的全局标度不变性是个体及其局部选择的迭代结果：偏向连接更多的节点而不是更少的。这个模型利用概率以使个体在一定程度上可以偏离这种选择行为：一些节点可以决定连接度数低的节点。然而，总体的趋势决定结果。作为进一步的确认，我们可以检查在没有优先连接原则下成长起来的网络是否末出现异质性。的确，新节点会随机地连接到旧节点上，如此一来旧节点的度数并不影响自身吸引新连接的能力。结果出现了同质网络，其中每个节点都有着大致相同的度数。

### 6.3 A Widespread Mechanism

Preferential attachment is the network version of a mechanism at work in many natural and social phenomena whose future evolution depends on their history. For example, the size of cities changes in time according to their present size: large cities experience large increases, small cities have small changes. Tomorrow’s stock prices are also proportional, on average, to today’s prices. This mechanism is also called multiplicative noise. There are various reasons why such a process may be at work in many networks. In some situations, having many links is the main way to be discovered by new nodes. A website linked to by many others is more easily found by people browsing the Web than is a less linked one. The same happens to highly cited papers. This increased visibility makes it easier to receive even more links or citations.

In other cases, links are attractive for their own sake. Sociologists have found evidence of indirect mate choice in which people choose their partner not only on the basis of that individual’s personal features, but taking into account as well other people’s opinion. For example, a study found that college-age women tend to rate higher a man in a picture where he is surrounded by many other women than the same man photographed alone. A long list of previous partnerships may put a person in a good position to attract even more partners. This is why preferential attachment is also called the popularity is attractive principle.

A more conscious reason for preferential attachment is that linking to hubs grants easier access to many other nodes. Since deregulation, in 1978, many airlines have adopted a hub policy , consisting in choosing well connected airports as their favourite destinations. The incentive is clear: since these airports provide access to a large range of destinations, connecting to them attracts more potential clients. Something similar happens in the web of interlocking directorates: a director that sits on many boards has access to a lot of information and a broad vision, something that makes it very attractive to hire him or her onto even more boards. Access is essential in the Internet, too. A large part of the Internet is set up and maintained by private companies, called Internet Service Providers (ISPs). When one of them sets up a new infrastructure, its priority is granting users rapid access to the information stored in the network. With this idea in mind, ISPs do not choose at random the routers to which they want to connect, nor do they just choose the closer ones. On the contrary, they select nodes that grant access to the greatest possible number of servers, in the smallest possible number of steps. And what is better than a hub to achieve this? In the case of the Internet, the data provided by the mapping projects seem to agree with the preferential attachment hypothesis. Figures show that vertices with many connections in a map issued at a certain time tend to have even more connections in the next map.

In some cases, a preferential attachment process comes in the guise of other mechanisms. Imagine someone wants to create a personal web page. A common strategy is to look at friends’ pages and pick a nice one to use as a template. Since a person usually shares common interests with his or her friends, the new web page will likely keep most of the links of the template, maybe changing a f`$`mo of theew of them. So in the end, the new page will be a copy of the template, with a few changes. Now, this mechanism disguises a form of preferential attachment. In fact, to what pages does the template point to? Most likely to hubs. Only because hubs exist, and capture a large fraction of the connectivity of the WWW, any given page will point more likely to hubs than to weakly connected pages. So, if a page is duplicated, each copy brings even more links to hubs, resulting in an effective rich-get-richer process, so that the preferential attachment rule is recovered. The copying mechanism seems weird, but in fact it is a leading factor in several situations. For example, scientific citations included in an article are often drawn from other articles in the same field, and tend to consolidate the authorities of the sector.

But one of the most interesting applications is in genetic networks. Genomes often evolve through the process of duplication and diversification. During cell replications, all the DNA is copied to the new cells, but sometimes a mistake happens: a full gene of the original DNA chain is duplicated, and appears twice in the genome of the daughter cell (duplication). Most of the time, this new gene just produces redundant proteins that do the same as its twin. However, in further replications, one of the two can suffer a mutation that may allow its protein to perform new biological functions, for example interacting with different proteins than its former twin (diversification). This evolutionary mechanism has been observed in many cases. Now, its translation in terms of the protein interaction network is totally akin to a copying mechanism: a new node enters the network (the copied and mutated protein), with some of the links of its ancestor (the proteins with which it originally interacted), and some new ones, due to the mutation. Highly connected proteins have a natural advantage in this mechanism: it is not that they are more likely to be duplicated, but they are more likely to have a link to a duplicated protein than the weakly connected ones, and therefore they are more likely to gain new links.

Although the role of gene duplication has been shown only for protein interaction networks, there is evidence in favour of preferential attachment (either direct or in disguise) as well in metabolic networks. An obvious consequence of this linking procedure is that usually hubs are between the older nodes in the network, because they have had the opportunity to profit from ‘first mover advantage’. Now, metabolic hubs are precisely primitive molecules, possibly incorporated in the genome during the evolution of the first forms of life, remnants of the RNA world such as coenzyme A, NAD, and GTP, or elements of the most ancient metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. In the context of the protein interaction networks, cross-genome comparisons have found that, on average, the evolutionarily older proteins have more links to other proteins than their younger counterparts.

Preferential attachment is not the only mechanism at work in networks, and not all heterogeneous networks come from this mechanism. However, the Barabási–Albert model gives an important take-home message. A simple, local behaviour, iterated through many interactions, can give rise to complex structures. This arises without any overall blueprint, and it appears even if we allow for a certain level of randomness in the behaviour, accounting for individual deviation with respect to general trends.

普遍的机制

优先连接特指网络中的此种机制，而同样的机制还存在于许多自然和社会现象中，这些现象未来的演化取決于它们的历史。例如，城市拠模依其目前的大小随时间而改変：大城市会经历较大的扩张，小城市则变化很小。明天的股票价格通常也与今天的价格构成一定的比例关系。这种机制也被称为乘性噪声。这一过程可能会在众多网络中起作用有着各种各样的原因。在某些情况下，具备许多连接是被新节点发现的主要方式。

与许多其他网站连接的网站要比那些连接更少的网站更容易被浏览网页的人发现。高引文献中的情也是如此。这种增强的受关注程度使得它更容易获得更多连接和引用。

在其他情况下，连接因其自身之故而具有吸引力。社会学家发现了间接择偶这一现象的证据，即人们选择自己的配偶不仅基于相关个体的个人特征，还会考虑他人意见。例如，一项研究发现，同一人在照片中被许多其他女性环绕时，要比其独照能获得处于大学年龄段的女性更高的评价。先前一系列合作伙伴的长名单可能会让一个人处于吸引更多合作伙伴的优势地位。这便是为何优先连接也被称为受欢迎具有吸引力原则的原因。

优先连接产生的一个更加有意的理由是，与枢纽节点相连能够使相关节点更容易接近许多其他节点。自 1978 年放松管制以来，许多航空公司纷纷采取了枢纽政策，此政策在于选择具备良好连接条件的机场作为它们最偏爱的目的地。动机很明确：由于这些机场与大量目的地相连，与之关联便会吸引更多的潜在客户。类似的事情也发生在连锁董事网络中：任职多个董事会的人可以获取大量信息，并具有广阔视野，这又使他具备很大的吸引力从而被雇用到更多的董事会中。访问在互联网中也至关重要。互联网的大部分由私人企业建立和维护，它们被称为互联网服务提供商。当它们中有一个建立了新的基础设施，其优先考虑之事便是允许用户快速访问网络中储存的信息。考虑到这一点，互联网服务提供商并不会随机选择它们想要连接的路由器，更不会只选择更近的。相反，它们会选择那些能够保证以最少的可能步骤连接到最多服务器的路由器。那么，又有什么比枢纽节点更能实现这一点？在互联网的情况中，绘图计划所提供的数据似乎符合优先连接的假设。数字显示，某一特定时刻发布的地图中带有很多连接的顶点，往往在下一幅图中会有更多连接。

在某些情况下，优先连接会以其他机制的面目出现。设想某人想要创建个人网页。常见的办法是查看朋友的页面，挑选一个不错的用作模板。由于人们常与其朋友有着共同的兴趣，因而新网页很可能会保留模板的大多数链接，或许会改变其中少数。所以，新的页面最终将是模板的副本，变化很少。现在，这种机制掩盖了优先连接的形式。事实上，模板网页会指向什么页面呢？它们很可能会指向枢纽页面。仅仅因为枢纽页面存在并俘获了万维网中的大部分连接，任一给定页面都更可能指向枢纽处，而非那些连接较少的页面。因此，如果某个页面被复制，则每个副本都会为枢纽来更多的连接，从而形成有效的富者更富过程，优先连接规则因而得到恢复。复制机制看起来奇怪，但实际上它在某些情况下是主导因素。例如，一篇文章中的科学引文通常来自同一领域的其他文章，并往往会固该引用文章的权威性。

但复制机制最有趣的一种应用体现在基因网络中。基因组常常通过复制和多样化的过程演化。细胞复制时，所有的 DNA 都被复制到新细胞中，但有时候也会出错：原始 DNA 链条的一个完整基因被复制，并在子细胞的基因组中出现两次（复制）。大多数时候，这个新基因只是合成多余的蛋白质，这些多余蛋白质与另外那个相同基因所合成的蛋白质功能相同。然而，在进一步的复制中，两个相同基因中的一个可能会发生突，从而会使自身合成的蛋白质行使新的生物功能，比如，与之前和自己一样的蛋白质之外的蛋白质发生反应（多样化）。许多情况中都已经发现了这种演化机制。现在，这种机制在蛋白质相互作用网络中的转化完全类似于复制机制：新的节点进入网络（复制和突变的蛋白质），它带来了一些前代的连接（即它最初与之反应的蛋白质），以及由突变而来的一些新蛋白质。高度连接的蛋白质在这种机制中占据天然优势：并非它们更可能被复制，而是它们比那些连接较弱的蛋白质更可能与复制蛋白质相关联，因而更有可能获得新连接。

尽管基因复制的作用仅在蛋白质相互作用的网络中显现，但代谢网络中也存在着支持优先连接的证据（直接或伪装）。这种关联过程的一个明显后果是，枢纽节点通常在网络里的旧节点中产生，因为它们之前有机会从「先发优势」中获益。现在，代谢枢纽正是可能在生命最初演化过程中并入基因组的原始分子，以及 RNA（核糖核酸）世界的残余物，比如辅酶 A、NAD（烟酰胺腺嘌二核苷酸）和 GTP（鸟苷三磷酸），或者最原始代谢途径的元素，比如糖酵解和三羧酸循环。在蛋白质相互作用网络的背景下，人们通过跨基因组的比较发现，平均来说，演化上较老的蛋白质与其他蛋白质之间的联系要较新的蛋白质多。

优先连接并非网络中唯一起作用的机制，也并非所有的异质网络都起源于此。然而，巴拉巴西-奥尔贝特模型还是给出了重要的关键信息。某种简单的局部行为经过多次交互迭代作用，便能产生复杂的结构。这种结构是在没有任何整体设计下产生的，即便我们允许在行为中出现一定程度的随机性它也会出现，这解释了就整体趋势而言的个体偏差。

### 6.4 When Fitness Matters

When an occasional sexual relation is at stake, people tend to be very tolerant with respect to certain features of the potential partner, such as political ideas, social class, 5, 42, 99

Homogamy , the tendency of like to marry like, is very strong even in societies where marriages are not combined and, theoretically, everybody could match with everybody else. In the turbulent college years, the prestige of an individual — as measured, for example, by the number of his or her previous sexual partnerships — can be a relevant driving force in shaping the sexual relations networks. But when people settle down, much stricter criteria come into force. While in the first case the rich-get-richer process can be at work, it can hardly explain the second case. Homogamy is a specific instance of homophily : this consists of a general trend of like to link to like, and is a powerful force in shaping social networks, according to much sociological evidence. In the Barabási–Albert model, the main criterion for linking to a node is the number of its links, but in many situations, other features, independent of the actual number of links, are much more important for attracting new links.

A consequence of the Barabási–Albert dynamics is that old nodes have a cumulative advantage over new ones. However, this is not always the case in practice. For example, old glories of the Web, such as Magellan or Excite search engines, are now mostly forgotten. Newer ones, such as Google or Yahoo!, have taken their place. Cumulative advantage can be completely overthrown when a new actor enters the game (think Facebook, for example). Newcomers often have some intrinsic feature that makes them much more attractive than older players. In this case, the connectivity of a network is not exclusively driven by the degree of the nodes, as in the Barabási–Albert model. On the contrary, a particular character of each node can play a very important role in its ability to gain links. This character is referred to as the fitness of the node, or as its hidden variable , a feature that shapes the structure of the network without being as evident as the number of links.

In 2002, physicists Guido Caldarelli, Andrea Capocci, Paolo De Los Rios, and Miguel Ángel Muñoz devised a model to generate a network only on the basis of its nodes’ fitness. The basic recipe is identical to the random graph: within a set of nodes, all the possible pairings are considered, and a link is drawn or not between each pairing, according to a given probability. However, in this case, the probability is not fixed, but changes depending on the fitness values of the nodes in the pair. The first step in the model is distributing fitness to the nodes. This hidden variable may represent, for example, the income of an individual. If this is the case, it would be distributed between the nodes in such a way as to mimic the wealth distribution of a country: a few very rich nodes, then a certain number of upper-middle-class nodes, then lower-middle-class, and so on. The second step is defining the probability of linking. In order to simulate a highly segregated society, one could establish the following rule: the probability that two individuals form a social relation depends on the difference between their incomes `$`mo of the; specifically, it is inversely proportional to it. That is, the higher the difference of income, the lower the probability they get connected. There is always some chance that two individuals with very different incomes could get connected, but in any case this will not be the leading trend: in general, homophily will triumph.

The fitness model may seem an overly simplified mechanism, but in some cases it works perfectly: for example, in the world trade web. In this case, the fitness is the GDP of the countries of the world. The linking rule is the following: the higher the fitness of two countries, the higher the probability that they get connected: this would be a kind of fit-get-richer mechanism, in which the countries with highest GDPs tend to build more commercial links with each other. This is a different mechanism from homophily, because while high-GDP countries establish many links with similar ones, low-GDP countries do not link with other low-GDP countries; they just stay poorly linked. Physicists Diego Garlaschelli and Mariella Loffredo showed in 2004 that these ingredients are enough to predict with great precision the features of the world trade web, provided that one feeds into the model the overall number of existing commercial links at any given time. For example, the model predicts exactly the shape of the degree distribution of the network. This suggests that the basic mechanisms underlying the self-organization of the world trade web are captured by the simple dynamics of the fitness model.

Like preferential attachment, it is unlikely that the fitness mechanism is at work in all real-world networks. While the Barabási–Albert model is plausible when applied to growing networks, the fitness model works also for static networks, where the number of nodes is mainly fixed. Nevertheless, they can be at work at the same time: in 2001, physicists Ginestra Bianconi and Albert-László Barabási introduced the idea of fitness in a preferential attachment model, showing that a mixture of the two effects gives a good prediction of the Internet’s topological properties. It has to be noticed that the fitness model does not always yield a power-law degree distribution. A broad range of distributions of fitness and linking rules generates it, but many others do not. However, this is not a limitation, but rather a positive aspect of the model, that allows it to be applied also to non-heterogeneous networks such as the world trade web.

适应度起作用之时

当偶然的性关系在紧要关头时，人们往往对潜在性伙伴的某些特征（例如政治观念、社会阶层或是否抽烟等）非常宽容。然而，当考虑订婚或结婚时，这些因素就变得十分重要。这是社会学家爱德华·O.劳曼对 90 年代中期的数据进行分析之后得到的信息。这些数据表明，美国约有 3/4 的已婚夫妇都具备大量的相似特征。其中包括，属于同样的社会阶层、种族群体，教育水平相同，甚至具有相近的魅力、政治观点和健康行为，比如饮食和吸烟习等。另一方面，当其他类型的性关系出现问题之时，相应的比例会低许多，尽管依旧很高（超过 50%）。

同配生殖（即相似个体彼此结合的倾向）甚至在那些婚姻非包办、理论上任何人都能与其他任何人结合的社会中都是很强的趋势。在躁动的大学时代，个人的声望 一一 例如，对此人之前的性伴侣数量进行衡量得出 一一 可以成为塑造性关系网络的相关驱动力。但是，人们安定下来后，更严格的标准便会发生效力。尽管富者更富能在第一种情况中发挥作用，但它几乎无法解释第二种情况。同配生殖是同质相吸的一个具体例子：大量社会学证据表明，它是由相似个体相互关联所构成的一般趋势，也是塑造社交网络的强大力量。在巴拉巴西-奥尔贝特模型中，连接到一个节点的主要标准便是该节点的连接数，但在许多情况下，其他特征对吸引新连接而言重要得多，不管实际的连接数为多少。

巴拉巴西-奥尔贝特动力机制的一个结果是，旧节点相对于新节点而言具备累积优势。然而，实际情况并非总是如此。举个例子，万维网的旧日荣光，比如麦哲伦或 Excite 等搜索引擎大多已被遗忘。谷歌或雅虎等后来者已取代了前者的位置。累积优势在新的参与者进入游戏时可被完全推翻（想想脸书的情况）。新手往往具备一些固有特征，这让它们比之前的参与者更具吸引力。在这种情况下，网络的连接性并非完全由节点度数驱动，正如巴拉巴西-奥尔贝特模型中所展现的一样。相反，每个节点的某种特殊的特性能够在节点获得连接的能力中发挥十分重要的作用。这种特性被称为节点的适应度，或称为节点的隐变量，它能够塑造网络的结构，却不像连接数那般显而易见。

2002 年，物理学家圭多·卡尔达雷利、安德里亚卡波奇、保罗·德·罗斯·里奥斯以及米格尔·安琪儿·穆诺兹共同设计了个仅凭节点适应度便可产生网络的模型。其基本思路与随机图相同：在一组节点内，考虑所有可能的配对，再依据某一给定概率看配对节点之间是否能够连接。然而，在这种情况下，概率并不固定，而是依节点在配对中的适应度而改变。模型首先会为节点分配适应度。比如，这个隐变量可能代表了个人的收入。在此情况下，适应度在节点间的分配便会类似于国家的财富分配：先是少数十分富有的节点，然后是一定数量的上层中产阶级节点，之后便是下层中产阶级节点，诸如此类。定义连接的概率是第二步。若要模拟高度隔离的社会，则可建立以下规则：两个人形成社会关系的概率取決于他们收入的差异；具体而言，这种概率与收入差距成反比。也就是说，收入差异越大，两人获得连接的概率便越小。两个收入差别很大的人之间也可能建立联系，但这绝不是社会的主流趋势：一般而言，同质相吸原则将最终胜出。

适应度模型这种机制可能看起来过于简化，但在某些情下，它能完美地发挥作用：例如，在世界贸易网络中便是如此。在这种情况下，适应度便是世界各国的国内生产总值（GDP）。连接的规则如下：两个国家的适应度越高，它们彼此关联的概率就越大 —— 这将是某种适者更富的机制，其中那些 GDP 极高的国家会在彼此之间建立更多的商业联系。这种机制与同质相吸原则并不相同，因为，尽管 GDP 高的国家之间会建立许多联系，但 GDP 较低的国家并不会与其他低收入国家建立联系：它们的联系仍旧少得可怜。物理学家送戈·加拉斯凯利和马里耶拉·罗弗雷多于 2004 年证明，这些组成部分足以精确预测世界贸易网络的特征，只要人们在模型中写入任意时刻的已有商业联系总数。例如，该模型精确地预測到了网络的节点度数分布态势。这表明，隐含在世界贸易网络这种自组织之下的基本机制已被适应度模型这种简单的动力机制捕捉到了。

跟优先连接一样，适应度机制不大可能在所有的现实世界网络中起作用。巴拉巴西-奥尔贝特模型被用于扩张中的网络时还算可靠，适应度模型对静态网络也有效，后者的节点数大致是固定的。然而，这两种模型还能同时起作用：2001 年，物理学家吉内斯特拉·比安科尼和巴拉巴西共同将适应度这概念引入到优先连接模型中，证明了这两种效应的共同作用良好预测了网络的拓扑属性。但必须注意的是，适应度模型并不总呈幂律度数分布。大范围的适应度和连接规则才能产生幂律度数分布，但很多其他的则无法做到这一点。然而，这并非某种局限性，而是这种模型积极的一面，这使得它能应用于像世界贸易网络这样的非异质网络。

### 6.5 A Variety of Strategies

The myth of the girl (or boy) next door has passed into history. In the mid eighties, the number of people that reported meeting their spouses in their own neighbourhood was already negligible, about 3 per cent in France, according to a 1989 study by sociologists Michel Bozon and François Heran. However, just three decades earlier, this case was quite common: Bozon and Heran found proportions of 15 to 20 per cent between 1914 and 1960. In a number of countries in the world, this is still the situation. In some settings, marriages (and social relations in general) are driven neither by some kind of popularity nor by similarity criteria: when geographical constraints matter (for example, if regular access to long-range transport is not available), one is forced to make friends with neighbours and fellow villagers.

In these cases, the vertices of a network are embedded in physical space and this has many important consequences. In some cases, one can connect at almost no cost with anybody else (making friends on a virtual social network). But in other situations, a long-distance connection is quite costly. The properties of the networks in the two cases are then quite different. Many infrastructure networks (trains, gas tubes, highways, etc.) display this bias, since they are embedded in the physical should not be underestimatedal of the space. Other networks are embedded in time: for example, scientific papers are published on a certain day, and this creates a bias in linking, namely that new papers can cite only older ones, while old papers cannot cite newer ones.

各种策略

邻家女孩（或男孩）的神话已成为历史。根据社会学家米尔·博宗和弗朗索瓦·埃朗 1989 年的一项研究，80 年代中期，在自己小区找到配偶的入已微乎其微了，在法国这一比例仅为 3%。然而，这种情况仅在 30 年前还十分普遍：博宗和埃朗发现，这一比例在 1914 年到 1960 年间为 15-20%。世界上许多国家中的情况依旧如此。在某些情况下，婚姻（以及一般意义上的社会关系）既不受某种流行趋势驱动，也不受相似性标准驱动倘若地理限制影响很大（比如，无法定期搭乘远程交通），人们便会被迫与邻里以及同乡交友。

在这些情况下，网络的顶点被嵌入到物理空间中，这会帯来许多重要后果。有时，人们几乎可以不费任何代价地与任何人建立联系（比如在虚拟网络上结交朋友）。但在其他情下，远程联系则代价高昂。这两种情下的网络属性也十分不同。许多基础设施网络（火车、气管、高速公路等）会显示出一种偏差，因为它们嵌入的是物理空间。其他网络则嵌入到时间之中：例如，科学论文会在某天发表，这会在网络连接中造成某种偏差，即新论文只能引用日论文，而旧论文却无法引用新论文。

其他偏差和策略能够影网络的形成。社会学家确定了人们在社交网络中建立联系的两种基本激励机制：为基于机遇的前因，即两个人会建立联系的可能性，二为基于利益的前因，即某种促使关系形成的效用最大化或不适感最小化机制。某种数量上的全局最优化对于塑造技术网络能够发挥重要作用：例如，使万维网搜索成本最小化的压力会导致人们倾向于对最短路径长度和连接密度进行优化。

最后，甚至还可能出现这种情况：表面上的自组织起源于完全的随机状态。设想某公司发布了新的社交网络，并为 10 万人提供了昵称。然后，该公司许可 1 个人与其他 1000 个人建立联系，2 个人可与其他 500 人建立联系，3 个人可与 333 人建立联系，4 个人可与其他 250 人建立联系，以此类推。人们并不认识昵称背后的人，所以，他们会随机地选择伙伴。显然，这一过程中并不存在自组织：该公司建立的规则决定了网络的结构。然而，最后形成的网络在结构上仍呈现出幂律度数分布。这个例子表明，在某些情况下，幂律并不总是意味着自组织过程。

若人们试图通过为其行为建模的方式来理解网络的特征，则策略、偏差、过程和动机等一系列广泛的因素都必须被考虑进去。甚至，每个个体网络都需要自己的模型。然而，一些十分普遍的机制，比如优先连接或与适应度相关的动力机制，都可能会在许多明显不相关的众多网络的形成过程中发挥作本章描述的模型简单地解释了，在缺乏全局规划的情况下，局部机制何以确实能产生规模庞大、复杂、有序及有效的结构。
