## 0701. 重点不在于你

0701 It's not about you

It's 1990 and I'm in my GP consulting room in Trowbridge. I've only seen Sarah a couple of times before when she makes an appointment just after Christmas. I haven't been in general practice for very long and I'm keen to make my mark. I'm proud of my medical knowledge and I want to show it off.

Sarah often feels rather low, she tells me, especially in the winter when the nights close in. This time she's complaining of a spot of indigestion too. She thinks it's because she's had a big family Christmas with her children and grandchildren, and they've all overdone it a bit. Her appetite's been poor and she doesn't feel right, though she can't put her finger on why. A few days ago her husband said he thought the whites of her eyes looked slightly yellow, but she thinks that's just a trick of the light.

Looking at Sarah, I think her husband may be right and I start to get an uneasy feeling. Jaundice is a worrying sign. After a few more questions, I ask her to lie on my examination couch and I check her physically. As soon as I put my hand on her abdomen (‘palpating' it, to use the technical term) I know that something's wrong. As she breathes in and out I can feel the edge of her liver; it's hard and irregular. All my surgical instincts kick in and I realize she has something serious, probably cancer.

In a clinical sense, I'm pleased to have recognized the problem. As a surgeon I've treated lots of patients with symptoms like Sarah's and I know what to do. She'll need blood tests, X-rays and scans, urgent referral to a specialist and then probably a major operation – the kind of operation I used to perform myself.

After I've examined Sarah and we're sitting at my desk, she asks me what I think the matter is. I'm on the brink of telling her, outlining the steps that lie ahead and at the same time letting her know what an acute diagnostician I am.

But then I remember it's not about me, it's about Sarah. I'm not showing off my knowledge on a ward round; I'm in a room with another person, trying to work out how to tell her she could be seriously ill. She's not interested in all the work I've done to get here, or the exams I've passed along the way. At this moment it's irrelevant. My knowledge only counts for anything if I can channel it into doing the right thing for Sarah. It's not about what I need to tell her, but how .

Something warns me not to go too fast. Instead of saying what I think the problem is, I ask her, ‘What do you think might be wrong?' She looks at me for a long moment. Neither of us says a word.

1990 年，我在特罗布里奇的全科医生诊室里。萨拉预约了圣诞节后来就诊，我之前只见过她几次。我做全科医生的时间还不长，我很想闯出自己的名声。我为自己的医学知识感到自豪，很想炫耀一下。

萨拉告诉我，她经常感到情绪低落，尤其是在冬天夜晚降临的时候。这次她还抱怨有些消化不良。她觉得这是因为她和孩子、孙辈一起度过了一个热闹的家庭圣诞假期，他们搞得有些过于隆重了。她胃口不好，感觉不舒服，但说不清原因。几天前，她丈夫说他觉得萨拉的眼白有些发黄，但她认为这只是光线导致的错觉。

我看着萨拉，觉得她丈夫可能是对的。我开始有了一种不安的感觉。黄疸是一种令人担忧的迹象。又问了几个问题之后，我让她躺在检查椅上，对她做了身体检查。我一把手放在她的腹部（用专业术语讲，这是「触诊」），就知道出了问题。在她呼吸的时候，我能感觉到她肝脏的边缘：硬且形状又不规则。我所有的外科直觉都警醒了起来，我意识到她得了重病，很可能是癌症。

从临床的角度来讲，我很高兴能发现这个问题。做外科医生时，我治疗过很多有萨拉这样症状的患者，我知道该怎么做。她需要验血、X 光和各项扫描，然后被紧急转诊给专科医生，然后她可能要动大手术 —— 就是我以前会自己动手做的手术。

检查完萨拉之后，我们坐在办公桌旁。她问我觉得有什么问题。我差点就把上面那些步骤全都告诉她了，并且还要让她知道我是多么敏锐的诊断专家。

但我接下来想起这项工作的重点不在于我，而在于萨拉。这不是我在查房时炫耀自己的知识的时候。我正在和另一个人共处一室，并想办法告诉她，她可能病得很重。对于我走到今天这个地步所付出的努力、通过的考试，她都不感兴趣。此时此刻，那些都无关紧要。只有能为萨拉做出正确的事情，我的知识才有意义。重点不是我要告诉她的内容，而是告诉她的方式。

有个声音提醒我不要操之过急。我没有说我认为问题是什么，而是问她：「你觉得哪里出了问题？」她看了我好一会儿。

我们都没有说话。

### 7.1 关心的魔力

The magic of care

This chapter explores the crucial transition ‘from you to them'. We'll see how experts shift their focus from themselves to the people their work is for. At the heart of this lies purpose . Your purpose is why you're working to become an expert in the first place.

This shift from you to them is an internal process, and it often goes unnoticed. It doesn't always coincide with other aspects of development, with the transition from Apprentice to Journeyman and from supervised to independent practice. It's a shift which is challenging to spot. In some people, it's there from the outset. In others, it doesn't seem to happen at all. Yet this shift of emphasis is central to becoming an expert.

We're now in the second phase of the path to becoming expert. Now, you're applying what you've learned as an Apprentice to problems in the real world. You're no longer a protected trainee – you're taking responsibility for the impact of your work on other people. You've spent years doing time, you've become skilled at working with your tools and materials, and you're adept at navigating other people's personal space. You've been flying solo and you've had near misses. You've made mistakes and you've recovered. But all of this has been focused on you. It's been about your development, your skills, your mistakes. Now you have to switch your focus to other people.

I'll start by looking at an unusual kind of expert performance – magic. The seeming juxtaposition of serious illness and an entertaining magic show may strike a jarring note, but as I'll explain, there are powerful similarities between these apparently unconnected ways of being expert. They both rely on high levels of specialist knowledge and technical skill, and they both depend on caring for another person's experience.

Richard McDougall comes to your table at a function. You're with some friends and you're not expecting anyone else to join you. He asks if you'd like to see some magic. You say yes, and for the next few minutes you're spellbound by the extraordinary tricks he performs. Coins and cards develop a life of their own, defying the laws of nature. Things appear, hover in mid-air, then vanish. After a few minutes, he smiles at you all, says goodbye and leaves. It seems effortless, and somehow the experience wasn't weird or awkward. Richard hasn't intruded on your dinner; he's enriched it. He hasn't been showing off, he's brought something new to your table. He became part of your group, and joined your conversation. What has he done and how has he done it? What, in essence, is magic? When I asked Richard this, he said, ‘You have to realize that magic isn't about you [the performer]. It's about them [the audience].'

Richard's magic is not about dexterity or skill, although he is extremely dextrous and highly skilled. His magic is about how he makes you feel. When learning to become a close-up magician, Richard spent years practising sleight-of-hand tricks. But sleight-of-hand tricks in themselves aren't magic. Magic needs an audience and that audience has to believe, just for a moment, that something impossible has really happened. For Richard, the crux came when he realized that it was the audience's experience that mattered, not his. When he performs, he's not just focusing on what he does, but on how it lands with those who see it. His observational faculties are highly tuned. He reads and responds to tiny signals in his audience that they're not even aware of.

Becoming expert requires you to focus on the people who experience your work – thinking from their perspective and not just your own. Alongside this shift comes a growing confidence in your own personality, and your identity as an expert. You have to subordinate yourself while also developing your uniqueness. It can be a difficult circle to square, and these two changes can pull in opposite directions. We'll explore that tension in the next chapter. But for now, we'll stay with the transition from you to them.

By the time I met Richard I'd become an academic. But talking to him took me back to my surgical career. When I was focusing on the skills of surgery, Richard was spending years working with cards and coins. We both became obsessed by the skills of our craft.

I loved operating. Most surgeons do. I revelled in the physicality of it, the sensation of working with living tissue. I found a satisfaction which was almost addictive. Incising, exposing, dissecting, removing and re-joining; opening an abdomen, mobilizing a colon, displaying a ureter, resecting an injured segment of intestine or creating an elegant anastomosis. Even closing the skin with economy and grace could be deeply satisfying. I enjoyed becoming a craftsman with living human tissue. For a long time, my focus was on myself, on the skills I was developing. But I was operating on real people. I had to keep in mind why I was doing surgery, and who I was doing it for.

Over the course of my career, I've known of clinicians who put their keenness to intervene above their patients' best interests. Driven by an urge to ‘cut', as that kind of surgeon might put it, they would rush to operate. Sometimes they allowed that to skew their judgement. Surgeons like this might carry out procedures that didn't really need to be done, or were beyond their experience. Sometimes they would get into difficulties, and needless harm would result. Operating became more about them than their patients. Their priorities were distorted, and things were out of balance.

For work to be expert, it must have a wider aim. Becoming expert takes years of dedicated effort; you need to have a good reason for doing it. Of course, there's personal satisfaction in being able to make, create and design. There's a reward in doing anything well for its own sake. But becoming expert is about something grander than that: it's doing something for other people. A crucial element is care ; you have a responsibility of care for whoever or whatever you're working with. It could be clay or silver, Renaissance statues or living human beings – whatever the medium, you must respect it and look after it.

This is not a linear progression, with a clear transition from you to them. There isn't one particular moment when your focus moves from your own skills to other people's needs. It's a gradual process, with blurry edges. Whether you're a clinician or a magician, what actually happens is that you start performing before you've become fully confident. You're out there in front of an audience – doing magic, playing an instrument or leading an operation. You're scared stiff that you'll drop a card, forget your lines, damage a vital structure or just look like an idiot. That's the space in which technical mastery is honed.

But how can you ensure that the seductiveness of technical mastery doesn't override judgement, care and the wisdom to leave well alone? How can you ensure that you don't over-focus on yourself and lose sight of the reason you're there in the first place? These questions were going through my mind in my GP consulting room with Sarah, my patient with jaundice.

So I asked her to tell me more about what was going on. It turned out there was a lot happening in her life. Her son's marriage was looking rocky, and he was starting to drink again. One of her grandchildren was causing problems; she thought he might be being bullied at school, but he wouldn't talk about it. They were retrenching staff at the factory where she had worked for decades, and things were looking precarious financially. The last thing she could afford was to be ill.

The reality of Sarah's health didn't seem to be uppermost in her mind. Unlike me, she wasn't thinking about tests and operations. She was thinking about how to handle all those things going on in her family, and she had come to me because her tiredness was getting in the way. I was pretty sure that she'd got something serious, and the sooner I referred her for specialist treatment the better. But doing so might worsen the problems she was most worried about.

I needed Sarah to recognize the seriousness of her symptoms while balancing them against the other things that were happening in her life. Then I could help her work out what to do. Doctors, like all other experts, are there to identify problems and help solve them. But being a good doctor is not as simple as sending someone off for tests the moment you think there's something wrong.

本章探讨了「从你到他们」的关键转变。我们会看到专家如何将他们的关注点从自身转移到他们服务的人群身上。这里的重点在于目的。你的目的是你当初努力成为专家的原因。

这种「从你到他们」的转变是一个内在的过程，而且经常被忽视。这种转变并不总是与其他方面同步发展，比如从学徒到熟练工，从被指导到独立工作的转变。这是一种很难发现的转变。对有些人来说，这种转变从一开始就发生了。对另一些人来说，似乎根本就不会发生。然而这种转变是成为专家的重中之重。

我们现在处在成为专家的第二阶段。现在，你开始把你在学徒阶段学到的知识应用于真实世界的问题上了。你不再是个受保护的实习生 —— 你要为自己的工作对他人造成的影响负责。你已经花了多年时间积累经验，你已经擅长使用工具、处理工作对象，你对于进入他人的个人空间也游刃有余了。你已经独当一面了，你也有过几次「未遂事故」。你犯过错误，也从打击中恢复过来了。但是，所有这一切的重点都在于你，都在于你的发展、你的技能、你的错误。现在你必须把关注点转移到其他人身上了。

我开始将目光放在一种不同寻常的专业领域上 —— 魔术。把严重的疾病和魔术表演放在一起可能会让人觉得不太合适，但我接下来会解释，这些看似毫不相关的专家成长之路之间有着很大的相似之处。它们都依赖于高水平的专业知识与技能，都依赖于关心他人的体验。

在一次宴会上，理查德·麦克杜格尔（Richard McDougall）来到你的桌子前。你正和几位朋友待在一起，没想到会有其他人加入。他问你想不想看魔术表演。你答应了。在接下来的几分钟里，你被他的非凡表演技巧给迷住了。硬币和扑克似乎拥有了自己的生命，无视自然的法则。物体会凭空出现，盘旋在半空中，然后又消失不见了。几分钟后，他对你们所有人笑了笑，说了声再见就离开了。他的表演看上去毫不费力，而不知何故，这种经历并不让人感觉奇怪或尴尬。理查德没有打扰你们吃饭，反而让晚餐变得更有趣了。他不是在炫耀，而是给你的餐桌上带来了新的东西。他成了你们中的一员，加入了你们的谈话。他到底做了什么？他是怎么做到的？从本质上讲，魔术是什么？当我问理查德这些问题时，他说：「你必须意识到，魔术的重点不在于你（表演者），而在于他们（观众）。」

理查德的魔术与灵巧的手艺或技能无关，不过他的确非常灵巧、技艺娴熟。他的魔术与他给你带来的感受有关。在学习成为近景魔术师的时候，理查德花了多年时间练习魔术手法。

魔术手法本身并不是魔术。魔术需要观众，而观众必须相信，在那一刻，不可能的事情真的发生了。对理查德来说，关键在于他意识到了，重要的是观众的体验，而不是他自己的体验。

在表演时，他不只是关注自己做了什么，还要关注观众对于他的表演有何反应。他的各项观察能力高度协调。他能读懂并回应观众自己都没意识到的细微信号。

成为专家需要你把注意力集中在你工作的受众身上 —— 从他们的角度思考，而不仅仅从自身的角度思考。伴随着这种转变，你会对自己的个性和专家身份越来越有信心。在发展自己独特性的同时，你必须让自己处于从属地位。这可能是个难题，这两种转变可能是背道而驰的。我们会在下一章探讨这种矛盾。

现在，我们继续讨论「从你到他们」的转变。在遇见理查德的时候，我已经成了一名学者。不过与他的谈话让我想起了我的外科医生生涯。在我专注于提高手术技能的时候，理查德也花了多年时间研究扑克与硬币。我们都深深地痴迷于各自的专业技艺。

我热爱手术。大多数外科医生都是如此。我陶醉于手术工作的物质特性，喜欢与活体组织工作的感觉。我在那种工作中找到了一种几乎能让人上瘾的满足感。切开、暴露、解剖、切除、重新缝合；开腹、移动结肠、找出输尿管、切除受伤的肠子、做一次完美的吻合术。仅仅是用简练优雅的手法缝合皮肤也能给我带来极大的满足感。我喜欢做一个与人体组织一同工作的工匠。很长一段时间以来，我关注的都是我自己、我正在培养的技能。但我是在有血有肉的人身上做手术。我必须牢记我为什么要做手术，为谁做手术。

在我的职业生涯中，我见过一些医生把他们对于医学干预的热情看得比患者的最大利益还重要。正如那种外科医生可能会说的那样，在「开刀」的冲动的驱使下，他们会轻率地动手术。有时他们会任由这种冲动影响自己的判断。这样的外科医生可能会做一些根本不需要做的，或者超出他们经验范围的手术。有时他们会陷入困境，造成不必要的伤害。对他们来说，手术比患者更重要。他们分不清轻重缓急，工作主次不分。

要想成为专家，就必须有更大的目标。成为专家需要多年的努力，而你需要一个很好的理由。当然，制作、创造和设计能带来个人的满足感。做好一件事是有回报的，但成为专家的意义远不止于此，而是要为他人做事。其中的关键因素是关心；你有责任去关心你工作所涉及的人或物。无论是黏土还是银器，无论是文艺复兴时期的雕像还是活人 —— 无论你工作的对象是什么，你都必须尊重它、照顾它。

「从你到他们」不是一个线性的发展过程，它没有界限分明的转变。不会到了一个特定的时刻，你的注意力就会从自身的技能转移到他人的需求上。这是一种渐进的过程，其边界是模糊的。事实上，无论你是医生还是魔术师，你在感到完全自信之前就开始工作了。你站在受众面前 —— 变魔术、演奏乐器或主刀做手术。你害怕自己会拿不稳扑克、忘记乐谱、损坏重要的组织，或者看起来像个傻瓜。这是一个磨炼技能的阶段。

但是，你怎样才能确保掌握技能的诱惑不会压倒你的判断、关心以及适可而止的智慧呢？你怎样才能确保你不会过度关注自己，忽视自己做这件事的初衷呢？在全科医生的诊室里，与黄疸患者萨拉待在一起时，这些问题一直在我的脑海中浮现。

所以我请她多讲一些她的情况。原来，她的生活中发生了很多事情。她儿子的婚姻出现了危机，而且他又开始酗酒了。她的一个孙子也在惹麻烦，她觉得这个孩子可能在学校被欺负了，但他不愿意说出来。她工作了几十年的工厂正在裁员，她的财务状况也不容乐观。她最不能承受的就是生病。

自己的健康状况似乎并不是萨拉最关心的问题。与我不同，她考虑的不是检查与手术。她考虑的是如何处理家里的所有事情，她来找我只是因为她的疲惫妨碍了她处理这些事情。我很确定她病得不轻，我越早建议她转诊去接受专科治疗，她的治疗效果就会越好，但这样做可能会使她最担心的问题恶化。

我需要让萨拉意识到她症状的严重性，并帮她在健康和生活中的其他事情之间找到平衡。然后我才能帮助她弄清该做什么。医生和其他专家一样，都要发现问题，并协助解决问题。要做一名好医生，不仅是在你认为患者有问题的时候，就把他送去做检查，事情并没有这么简单。

### 7.2 良好的判断

Good judgement

I didn't even realize the need for a shift from myself to others until I'd been studying medicine for a long time. For many years, I was the centre of my medical world. Throughout my early career, I was being assessed on how much I knew. I was struggling to memorize facts, learn how to examine patients and develop procedural skills. I used the way I treated patients as proof to my colleagues and assessors that I knew my stuff. As I developed, I wanted to use these facts and techniques that had taken so long to learn.

When I was a trauma surgeon in Africa, my focus was learning to operate. When I took patients into theatre, their personalities almost disappeared. Often they had arrived at the hospital unconscious, so I hadn't got to know them before their surgery began. On the operating table, when they were under anaesthetic, I was forced to concentrate on their bodies. Each operation was a technical challenge, and I was developing my skills as a craftsman with human tissue. Even when my patients started to recover after surgery, I didn't have time to get to know them properly because I was so busy dealing with more patients.

At that time, I was thinking about how I could become more proficient and be allowed to take on more responsibility. I wanted to do more ambitious procedures, undertake trickier operations. I was absorbed in the how of surgery more than the why . Because my focus was on myself, I didn't think much about clinical judgement.

Good judgement is complex and can be difficult to recognize. When I was a junior member in a surgical team, it was my bosses who made the decision to operate. My focus was the operation. I wanted to ‘assist' in theatre, then operate myself – I watched what my bosses did, and gradually they let me do things. During all those hours holding retractors, performing parts of operations and finally whole procedures under supervision, I was learning how to operate. But someone else had decided whether to operate, and what operation to do. Someone else was monitoring the wider situation. If something went wrong, they were there to take over and bail me out. At that stage, my ability to perform outstripped my experience and judgement. I was only seeing part of the landscape – each patient as a body, not a person.

Yet judging whether to operate and what operation to do can be the biggest challenge. One of my consultants when I was a surgical trainee told me, ‘A surgeon knows how to operate; a good surgeon knows when to operate; a really good surgeon knows when not to operate.' The latter requires judgement and restraint. Your duty of care must override your wish to intervene. By the time I was leading trauma teams at Bara, I had to make those judgements for myself.

Joshua the tailor was learning something similar at this stage in his career. Joshua had spent four years learning to be a making tailor. Then he set out to become a cutting tailor. When he began this second apprenticeship, he had to learn a new set of skills. As a making tailor, his focus had been on himself and the techniques he was trying to master. That's when he was struggling to make pocket flaps and buttonholes; he spent years doing boring repetitive tasks of no apparent value at the time. By the end of that apprenticeship, he had mastered the technical aspects of his craft and become a skilled professional jacket-maker. Like me, his focus had been on his own skills.

As a customer or client ordering a bespoke suit, you never see making tailors and they don't see you, any more than a patient sees what goes on behind the scenes in an operating theatre. But a cutting tailor spends much of their time with customers. During a fitting, Joshua seems utterly at ease and unhurried, whatever else is going on in his life. The outside world fades away as he talks about this or that. Yet whether he's chatting about cricket or textile patterns, his conversation isn't just padding. It's how he builds relationships. He makes it clear to each client that they have his undivided attention. During a first visit he may show some sample books, registering the tiny cues that show what cloth that person likes and when they are just being polite. Like Richard the magician with his audience, Joshua is reading his client acutely. All the time, he's watching, thinking and taking mental notes. He's storing up those fine-grained observations to call upon later.

During each fitting Joshua walks round his customer, making occasional chalk marks on the embryonic jacket. Sometimes he starts to dismantle it there and then – ‘ripping the jacket down', as tailors call this process – by snipping the tacking stitches which hold collar or sleeve in place, and pulling the elements apart so they can be reassembled with adjustments at the next fitting. This emphasizes to the client that Joshua is making that suit just for them – their body, their needs and their way of life. The garment reflects Joshua's understanding of why that person has come to have a suit or jacket made in the first place.

This is uncannily like being a doctor. First you listen, then you speak. When I became a GP, I moved from medicine's equivalent of a making tailor to that of a cutting tailor. The dexterity skills I had worked so hard to acquire moved into the background. It was no longer the operating theatre that defined me, but my consulting room instead.

在学医很久之后，我才意识到有必要将关注点从自己转移到别人身上。多年以来，我的医学世界的中心一直是自己。在我早期的职业生涯中，别人总会根据我的知识水平来评价我。我一直在努力记忆事实性知识，学习如何给患者做检查，培养各项操作技能。我用我治疗患者的方式向我的同事和评价我的人证明我是懂行的。随着我的进步，我想要把花了那么长时间学来的知识和技能付诸实践。

我在非洲做创伤外科医生时，我的关注点是学习做手术。我把患者送进手术室时，他们的个性几乎完全消失了。他们来到医院时常常是不省人事的，所以在手术开始前我不了解他们。在手术台上，他们处于麻醉状态，我必须把注意力集中在他们的身体上。每次手术都是一次技能的挑战，而我在借此发展自己作为修复人体组织的工匠的技能。即使患者在手术后开始康复，我也没有时间去了解他们，因为我要处理更多的患者。

那时候，我考虑的是怎样才能让自己变得更熟练，能够被赋予更多的责任。我想做更有挑战性的手术，更复杂的手术。我专注于如何做手术，而不是为什么做手术。因为我的注意力集中在自己身上，所以我很少考虑临床判断。

良好的判断是复杂的，而且旁人很难发现。在我还是外科手术团队的浅资历成员时，做手术决定的人是我的上司。我的重点是做手术。我想「协助」手术，然后自己做手术 —— 我观摩了上司的手术，然后他们逐渐开始让我做一些事情。从握住牵开器、在监督下完成部分手术，再到最后完成整台手术的过程中，我在学习如何做手术。与此同时，其他人已经决定了是否做手术、做什么手术。还有人在监督整体情况。如果出了问题，他们就会接手，为我救场。在那个阶段，我做手术的能力发展得比经验和判断能力更快。我只看到了事情的一部分 —— 将患者看作人体，而不是一个人。

然而，判断是否做手术以及做什么手术，可能是最大的挑战。在我还是实习外科医生的时候，一位顾问医师告诉我：「外科医生知道怎么做手术，好的外科医生知道何时做手术，而真正优秀的外科医生知道什么时候不做手术。」要做到最后这一点，需要判断力和克制。你关心患者的义务必须战胜你做医学干预的意愿。在巴拉瓜纳医院带领创伤手术团队时，我就必须独立做判断。

裁缝约书亚在他职业生涯的这个阶段也学到了类似的东西。约书亚花了四年时间学习如何做制作裁缝。然后，他开始学习做剪裁裁缝。在他开始第二次学徒生涯时，他必须学习一套新技能。做制作裁缝时，他的关注点是自己和他在努力掌握的技能。那时他正在努力制作袋盖和纽扣孔。他花了数年时间做这些事情 —— 在当时看来，这些都是毫无价值、无聊重复的工作。在这段学徒生涯结束时，他已经掌握了这门手艺的技术，成了一名熟练的专业西装裁缝。就像我一样，他关注的也是自己的技能。

作为一名订购定制西装的顾客，你永远不会看到制作裁缝，他们也不会看到你，就像患者看不到手术室里的幕后工作一样。但是，剪裁裁缝在大部分时间里都和顾客在一起。无论自己的生活中发生了什么，在顾客试穿时，约书亚都会显得十分自在和从容。在他谈论西装的各种话题时，外面的世界似乎都消失了。然而，无论是在谈论板球还是布料图案，他都不是在说废话。这是他建立关系的方式。他清楚地告诉了每一位客人，他会全心全意地关注他们。在顾客第一次上门时，他可能会给顾客看一些样品宣传册，通过细微的线索观察这个人喜欢哪种布料，以及他们什么时候只是在客套。就像魔术师理查德对待观众一样，约书亚也会敏锐地观察他的客人。他一直在观察、思考、默记于心。他把这些细微的观察结果储存起来，以便日后使用。

每次试穿时，约书亚都会绕着顾客走几圈，偶尔会用粉笔在西装的坯样上做记号。有时他会当场把坯样拆掉（按照裁缝的说法，这叫「把西装撕开」）。他会剪断固定领子或袖子的线，把零件拆开，以便在下次试穿时进行调整并重新缝上。这种行为向客人强调：这套西装是约书亚为他们 —— 为他们的身体、需求以及生活方式量身定做的。这件衣服反映了约书亚对这个问题的理解：这个人为什么要定做西装套装或西装上衣。

这与做医生如出一辙。首先你要倾听，然后再发言。在成为全科医生的时候，我就好比从制作裁缝转行做了剪裁裁缝一样。我辛苦获得的灵巧的操作技能不再是重点。定义我的不再是手术室，而是诊室。

### 7.3 肘部以上的学习

Learning from the elbows up

It was magicians who made me recognize the shift from you to them. By that time, I'd made that shift myself, though I hadn't thought of it in those terms. For a magician, though, the shift is very obvious. Although the stakes in medicine are in a different league, magicians and clinicians both have an audience. Without an audience, there may be dexterity and skill, but there's no magic, no medicine. To succeed, you have to bring your audience with you.

By the time I first met Richard, I was at Imperial College London, running a master's programme in surgical education. Richard is one of the UK's leading close-up magicians, with awards galore. He's a member of the Inner Magic Circle (Gold Star) and a former World Open Champion for close-up magic. He has given shows for the Queen and the Prince of Wales, and he performs around the world. Watching him work is uncanny. Of course the tricks that he does are impressive. Like all magicians at his level, he is a master of the apparently impossible. But even more remarkable is how he manages an audience, his ability to read people. This is a skill he's perfected over decades.

As a magician, Richard told me, your audience – whether it's of one or a thousand – needs to believe you are doing something impossible. During his early years, Richard set out to learn how to engage the people watching him; to capture and manage their attention. ‘Magic isn't just about giving the wrong information,' he said. ‘What magicians are very good at is making the unimportant seem incredibly important – and what's absolutely critical, very unimportant.'

Richard started learning magic at the age of six. When he was eight he ‘retired', as he put it. A couple of years later he came out of retirement and got back to it in earnest. He began with the skills of physical manipulation, working with coins, cards and cups. Richard calls that ‘learning from the elbows down'.

When Richard was learning it was all from books, but now there are videos online that allow you to copy an expert. Lots of beginners become very good at this. But however dextrous you are, moves are just moves unless there is an audience. There is no magic unless someone is watching. The experience of magic is jointly constituted. That happens ‘from the elbows up', and that's where Richard's real mastery lies.

When Richard performs, he creates a space where he engages with his audience. He uses his personality and charm to direct the audience's attention where he wants it. That establishes a place that is very close to where the audience is looking but which they are unaware of. As a magician, you have to understand how to move the spotlight of attention, to recognize where your audience is looking, and to make use of those spots of perceptual blindness as you perform a trick.

‘It's like boxing,' Richard told me. ‘Some positions suggest attack, others suggest defence. A boxer will feint, looking as if he's going to throw a punch. He'll create a space, then come in with the other hand. A magician does that too. You're creating a moment in an audience's mind where they think, "Something's about to happen, I've really got to watch this." But perhaps nothing happens, so they relax. And when their radar is lowered a little bit, that's when you can do something. Then you raise their attention again. These waves of attention and inattention that a magician learns to create are what allows him to make the technical moves imperceptible. It's not purely dexterity, there's a lot more going on.'

So how did Richard become the expert performer he is? He started with doing time. He cut his teeth in London's first ‘magic restaurant', decades ago. He performed there at tables five days a week, with a thirteen-hour stretch on Saturdays. At that point he had mastered the dexterity, the ‘tricks'. He had become an expert from the elbows down. But already that side of things was becoming repetitive and tedious, doing the same thing night after night.

He could have started to freewheel, relying on the well-worn skills he had mastered. Instead, he focused on becoming equally expert from the elbows up – on becoming an expert performer. He set himself challenges, like how to use body language to get a cocky young executive to sit back and relax, or make a powerful CEO lean forward and take notice. He could have spent his time developing fancier tricks – daring feats of dexterity that pushed the limits of his ability. But would the cocky executive or the powerful CEO have realized that one trick is physically harder than another? After all, if you do things right, your audience shouldn't be aware of any difficulty in the first place. So, rather than striving towards an arbitrary technical goal, Richard used those restaurant years as an experimental laboratory for learning to manage an audience.

Richard also talks about the importance of silence. ‘A lot of magicians think that if the audience are not clapping or laughing, they're not enjoying it,' he told me. ‘But that's not necessarily the case at all. That's a harsh lesson. Silence does feel awkward, but actually people are thinking, they're evaluating, they're processing. Silence is massively useful, providing it's done with warmth and sensitivity.' Every trick, he said, needs time to land. Lots of magicians are in a hurry to do the next one. But that's a mistake.

As a doctor, becoming comfortable with silence is equally important – and equally difficult to learn. That's what I was doing with Sarah in my consulting room, as I waited for her to process our conversation. Silence is not just the absence of speech; it provides space for a different kind of communication. As the GP and psychotherapist John Launer put it to me once, ‘Two silences can also be a conversation.' But we tend to leap in and talk instead of listening. We shy away from silence and we rush to fill the space.

When we listen instead of talking, our attention is where it should be – on those our work is for. Listening, then, is a hallmark of being expert. We cannot be in broadcast mode all the time. When we are doing something for others, we need to be quiet and pay attention. The communicative aspects of our work, the ebb and flow between performer and audience, require transmission, reception and silence.

The best advice Richard's magic teacher gave him was to go and see other magicians perform – but to watch the spectators, not the performer. Standing towards the back of a crowd, Richard learned to recognize the tiny signals of an audience's involvement. He registered those telltale flickers of an eye that show when someone is not completely absorbed. He taught himself to read each audience's collective response. Then he applied this to his own performance. He became like a shepherd corralling sheep, guiding them towards their pen and recognizing when they were moving as one. He came to understand how to steer them to where he wanted them to go, mentally as well as physically.

Magicians have a dictum about audiences: ‘If you want them to look at something, look at it ; if you want them to look at you, look at them .' It never fails. If you look at someone, they can't help looking at you; it's hard-wired into us as humans. And this apparently simple insight turns out to be remarkably powerful. When you can shape and direct someone's attention, you can apply that skill to all kinds of settings, from social gatherings to a professional performance.

But the dictum has a corollary. If you don't want them to look at something, don't look at it. Anyone who has consulted a doctor, a financial adviser, or been for a job interview knows what it's like when someone fixes their eyes on a computer screen instead of engaging with you. You are drawn to what they are looking at, whether you can see it or not. The invisible thread between you and them has been broken.

Showing that your attention is on something other than the person you are with sends powerful signals that you are not interested. Yet, as a professional, it's easy to focus on the requirements of your job, such as entering data into a computer system or looking something up online, rather than thinking of the experience of the person you're with.

As you become expert, the component skills of your craft must become instinctive. Returning to the theories we examined in Chapter 3 , you'll remember that we move from a cognitive through an associative to an autonomous stage of becoming expert, eventually gaining enough experience for the ‘doing' to look after itself. At the Royal College of Music, they say that when you go out on stage as a student, you must have practised so much that your best performance is good enough. But when you go out there as a professional, your worst performance must be good enough. That involves going far beyond the point at which you think you have perfected what you're going to play. You must be able to rely on your skills whatever happens, even if you're terrified or insecure, or things go unexpectedly wrong.

The textbooks refer to this as ‘over-learning'. You have to be able to perform under all circumstances, but especially when you have additional challenges. You must be able to carve, cut or sew not only when your materials and tools are compliant and of high quality, but also when there are flaws in the stone or wood, or your instruments are blunt or missing. You must be able to perform when your body is below par; when you're tired, unwell, stressed or anxious. You have to know what it feels like to be at or beyond the edge of what you are used to – or what you, your materials and the situation will tolerate without falling apart. You have to satisfy the audience, regardless of how you are feeling.

魔术师让我意识到了「从你到他们」的转变。那时，我自已已经做了这样的转变，不过我没有用这种方式思考过那些问题。然而，对于魔术师来说，这种转变是非常明显的。虽然魔术与医学所涉及的风险天差地别，但魔术师和医生都有自己的受众。如果没有受众，可能灵巧的手法与技能也会存在，但魔术和医学已不复存在了。要想成功，你就必须心怀受众。

第一次见到理查德时，我正在伦敦帝国理工学院开办外科教育硕士课程。理查德是英国顶尖的近景魔术师，获奖无数。他是英国魔术内圈（Inner Magic Circle）的金星成员，也是前世界近景魔术公开赛冠军。他曾为英国女王和威尔士亲王表演，并且在世界各地演出。他的表演简直不可思议。当然，他表演的戏法让人难以忘怀。就像所有他这个级别的魔术师一样，他是一个把不可能变为可能的大师。但是，更难能可贵的是他把握观众、阅读人心的能力。这是他几十年来不断完善的技能。

理查德告诉我，对魔术师来说，观众（无论是一个还是一千个）需要相信你在做不可能完成的事情。在早年间，理查德就开始学习如何吸引那些观看他表演的人，如何吸引并抓住他们的注意力。「魔术不仅是提供错误的信息，」他说，「魔术师最擅长的就是把不重要的事情变得极其重要 —— 却把最关键的东西变得毫不起眼。」

理查德从六岁开始学习魔术。用他自己的话说，他在八岁时就「退休」了。几年后，他复出了，全心全意地投入魔术。他从操纵物体（比如硬币、扑克和杯子）的技巧开始学起。理查德称之为「肘部以下的学习」。

当时，理查德是从书本上学习的，但现在网上有许多视频，可以让你模仿专家。很多初学者都很擅长模仿专家。但是，无论你的双手多么灵巧，如果没有观众，把戏就只是把戏而已。如果没有人看，就没有魔术。魔术的体验是双方共同创造的。这种现象「来自肘部以上」，这才是理查德真正的高明之处。

在理查德表演的时候，他创造了一个与观众互动的空间。他用自己的个性与魅力将观众的注意力引导到他想要的地方。这样一来，他在观众的眼皮底下创造了一个盲点，而观众却没有意识到这个盲点。作为一个魔术师，你必须知道如何转移注意力的焦点，意识到观众在看什么，在表演戏法的时候利用这些感知盲点。

「这就像拳击一样，」理查德告诉我，「有些姿势暗示进攻，有些则暗示防守。拳击手会佯攻，就像要出拳似的。他会虚晃一枪，然后用另一只手出拳。魔术师也会这样做。你要在片刻间让观众产生这样的想法 ——‘有些事情就要发生了，我可得好好看看'。但也许什么都没发生，所以他们放松警惕了。当他们放松警惕的时候，你就可以趁机做些事情了。然后你要再次引起他们的注意。魔术师学会了制造注意力的波动，使他们的技巧不被察觉。这不仅仅需要灵巧的双手，还有很多事情要做。」那么，理查德是如何成为如此专业的表演者的呢？他是从积累开始做起的。几十年前，他曾在伦敦第一家「魔术餐厅」积累经验。他每周在餐桌前表演五天，周六则会一连表演 13 个小时。那时，他的双手已经很灵巧了，已经掌握了那些「把戏」。他已经成了「肘部以下」的专家。但是，这些事情已经变得重复、乏味了，他只是在日复一日地做同样的事情。

他本可以依靠已经掌握的娴熟技能，随心所欲地表演。但是，他在「肘部以上」的技能也开始变得同样专业了 —— 他成了一名专业的表演者。他开始挑战自己，比如用肢体语言让趾高气扬的年轻高管安稳地坐着、放松，或者让位高权重的 CEO 身体前倾、聚精会神。他本可以把时间花在学习更花哨的把戏上 —— 一些大胆巧妙的花招，考验自己能力的极限。然而，那个自大的高管或有权势的 CEO 是否会意识到某种把戏的难度更高？毕竟，如果你做得很好，观众根本就不会意识到这有任何困难。所以，理查德并没有随便将某个技术上的目标作为奋斗方向，而是将那些在餐厅工作的岁月作为实验室，用来学习如何控制观众。

理查德也谈到了沉默的重要性。「很多魔术师认为，如果观众不鼓掌、不笑，那就说明他们不喜欢这场表演，」他说，「但事实并不一定如此。这是一个残酷的教训。沉默确实会让人感到尴尬，但实际上观众在思考，他们在评估、理解。只要用温暖的态度与敏锐的觉察去对待沉默，沉默就非常有用。」他说，每种把戏都需要时间才能被观众理解。许多魔术师都会急匆匆地去施展下一个把戏，但这是错的。

作为医生，从容应对沉默也同样重要 —— 也同样难以做到。这就是我和萨拉在诊室里要做的事情。当时我正在等她思考我们的谈话。沉默不只是没有说话，而是为另一种不同的交流提供了空间。全科医生兼心理治疗师约翰·劳纳（John Launer）曾对我说：「两次沉默也可以是一次对话。」但是，我们总是倾向于打破沉默、开口讲话，而不是倾听。我们会回避沉默，匆忙地把这种交流的空间填满。

如果我们倾听而不说话，我们的注意力就会放在该在的地方 —— 我们工作的初衷。因此，倾听是专家的标志。我们不能总像广播一样聒噪。当我们为别人做事时，我们需要安静、专注。工作中的沟通、表演者和观众之间的交流，都要传达、接收信息，以及沉默。

理查德的魔术老师给他的最好的建议是，去看看其他魔术师的表演 —— 不是看表演者，而是看观众。理查德站在人群的后面，学会了分辨观众全情投入表演的微小信号。他注意到，如果一个人没有全神贯注，眼睛就会有明显的闪烁。他学会了解读观众的集体反应。然后他把学到的这一点运用在自己的表演中。他变得像一个驱赶羊群的牧羊人，引导羊群走向羊圈，并且分辨观众何时在像羊群一样统一行动。他逐渐明白了如何向着自己想要的方向引导观众的心理和身体。

魔术师有一句关于观众的格言：「如果你想要他们看某样东西，你就要看它；如果你想要他们看你，你就要看他们。」这句话屡试不爽。如果你看向某人，他们就会情不自禁地看你，这是我们人类的本能。事实证明，这个看起来很简单的道理有着非常强大的力量。如果你能影响和引导别人的注意力，你就能将这种技能运用到各种场合 —— 从社交聚会到专业表演。

这句格言能产生一个推论：如果你不想让他们看某样东西，那你就不要看它。任何咨询过医生、金融顾问或参加过面试的人都知道，当对方的眼睛盯着电脑屏幕而不与你交流时是什么感觉。你会被他们所看的东西吸引，不论你是否能看到。你和他们之间无形的联结被打破了。

将注意力放在其他事物而不是你面前的人上，就会发出一个强有力的信号：你对这个人不感兴趣。然而，作为专业人士，你很容易把注意力集中在工作的要求上，比如将数据输入计算机系统，或在网上查找资料，而不考虑你身边的人的感受。

随着你成为专家，专业技能的各种组成部分必须成为本能。回顾我们在第 3 章讨论过的各个理论，你应该还记得我们会从认知阶段进入联想阶段，再进入成为专家的自动化阶段，最后我们会获得足够的经验，让「做事」的过程自动运行。皇家音乐学院有句俗话说，如果你作为学生登台演出，那你一定曾经勤学苦练，你最好的表现是足够好的；但是如果你作为专业人士登台演出，你最差的表现都必须是足够好的。这意味着你要远远超过你认为能够完美弹奏表演曲目的水平。无论发生什么事，即使你感到害怕、没有安全感，或者担心事情出差错，你都必须能够依靠自己的技能。

教科书将这种现象称为「过度学习」。你必须在任何情况下都表现出色，尤其是在面临额外的挑战时。你不仅要在材料优良、工具称手的情况下胜任雕刻、切割、缝纫的工作，而且要在石头、木料有瑕疵，工具不够锋利或遗失的情况下完成同样的任务。你必须在身体状况不佳时表现良好，在疲惫、不适、紧张或焦虑时发挥稳定。你必须知道处于舒适区的边缘或离开舒适区的感觉 —— 也就是你、工作对象以及工作情况能够容忍多大程度的考验而不崩溃。无论你有什么感受，你都必须让观众满意。

### 7.4 难忘的表演

A performance to remember

You also have to shape how people will remember an encounter, whether a magic show or a consultation with a doctor. Will Houstoun, another magician I've worked with, says that every magic trick takes place three times. The first is when the magician does it. The second is when an audience member thinks about it afterwards, replaying it in their mind and trying to work out what happened. The third time is when they tell someone else about it. Each time, the story changes slightly. Expert magicians are adept at shaping things so their audience remembers what the performer wants, rather than what actually happened.

It's not only magicians who do this. Experts design the conditions for selective recollection, focusing attention on some areas and directing it away from others. Though people don't go to the doctor to be entertained, they should still leave with a positive impression of the encounter, even though studies show that patients retain little of what was actually said. What they do remember is how the consultation made them feel. When someone leaves, they need to do so with the sense that the consultation has helped, and to feel that the doctor has attended to their experience and cared for them. They need to feel that the consultation hasn't been about the doctor, but about them.

This isn't only true for doctors and magicians, of course. It holds true for every realm of expert practice where there is a performance component. It's remembering how having a builder in our house made us feel, long after the job itself is finished. It's why people return to Fabrice the hairstylist – it's not simply that they liked the style he gave them; they remember enjoying having him cut their hair.

你还必须塑造人们对于某次经历的记忆，无论这次经历是魔术表演还是看医生。另一位与我一起工作过的魔术师威尔·胡斯顿（Will Houstoun）说过，每个魔术把戏会上演三次。第一次是魔术师的表演。第二次是观众事后回想，在脑子里回忆并试图弄清发生了什么。第三次是在他们告诉别人的时候。每一次，这场表演都会有细微的变化。专业的魔术师擅长塑造事物，让观众记住表演者想要他们记住的东西，而不是实际发生的事情。

不只有魔术师会这样做。专家会创造一些条件，制造选择性的记忆，让他人的注意力从其他方面转移开来，集中在某些方面。虽然人们看医生不是为了娱乐，但他们在离开时仍然应该有一个正面的印象 —— 尽管研究表明，患者几乎不记得医生实际上说了什么。他们记得的是看医生给他们带来的感受。当患者离开时，他们需要有这种感觉：医生对他们有所帮助，医生关注他们的感受，关心他们。他们需要感觉到，求医经历的重点不在于医生，而在于自己。

当然，这个道理不仅适用于医生和魔术师，还适用于每一种包含「表现」成分的专业实践领域。这种感觉就像房子建成很长时间之后，我们再次回想起建筑工在房子中工作时给我们带来的感受一样。这也是为什么人们会再次找发型师法布里斯 —— 不仅是因为他们喜欢法布里斯给他们设计的发型，更是因为他们记得他们喜欢让他剪头发的经历。

### 7.5 学会倾听

Learning to listen

Back in my consulting room with Sarah, I have to decide what to do next. I know what she needs medically – blood tests, CT scans and an urgent referral to a specialist. But all this is going to be difficult for her to take in. I don't want to mislead her. I can't tell her everything is going to be fine when I'm pretty sure it won't be; I have to be honest. If I'm right and she has got cancer, we'll be seeing a lot of one another in the months to come. We'll need to trust one another. My role will be to curate her experience of being ill, to shape it and ensure it's as good as it can be. To do that, I have to go at her pace, not force her to fit in with mine. I need to give her time, make space, keep quiet and listen. So how do I take things forward?

At first I don't say anything, but instead just sit quietly and wait. Then she says, ‘I've been wondering if it might be something more serious this time. Could it …?'

After a few moments, I say, ‘Maybe we've both been thinking along the same lines. I could be wrong, and I hope I am, but I'm concerned by what you've told me and we need to find out more. I'd like to arrange some tests, then an appointment at the hospital with a specialist. How would you feel about that?'

Sarah gives a reluctant sigh. ‘All right, Doctor,' she says. ‘Let's do that.' We both know that this is just the beginning of the story, but at least I'm not steamrollering Sarah with something she's not ready to hear.

As we talk, Sarah confides that she's thought for a while that something might be seriously wrong. She hasn't wanted to admit it, because of everything else going on in her life. She doesn't have time to be ill. She feels she can't cope with what a serious diagnosis might entail, because too many people depend on her. By the end of our consultation, she lets me arrange some tests and refer her to a specialist.

It turns out that she does have cancer, as we had both half suspected. From then on, the medical pathway seems mapped out – surgery, post-operative recovery, convalescence. But Sarah has a cancer of the pancreas, which is why the whites of her eyes have gone yellow from jaundice. Pancreatic malignancy is a particularly horrible form of cancer, and my heart sinks when the diagnosis is confirmed.

Over the weeks and months that follow, Sarah and I do see a lot of one another. What frightens Sarah most isn't the pain, or even dying. It's being taken into hospital and being alone. She fears for her family if she's gone. So that's what we spend most of our time talking about. It isn't my medical knowledge she needs most, but time to talk.

Later on, I recognize I was helping Sarah through an experience, not treating a disease. The best care I could give her was not in telling her about the science behind the drugs that would slow the cancer, or the operations she would undergo, or the technicalities of the test results and data. All of that played a role, and I needed to understand it so I could help guide her decisions. But my real job was to free up my attention and listen. The best medicine I could offer was to shift my focus to her.

So let's review the principles I've been describing. First, you become confident in the physical aspects of your work – cutting a fringe, doing magic tricks, making a jacket or a diagnosis. You practise, practise, practise until it becomes second nature. In time, you become so proficient that you can do it even when your materials are unruly, you're feeling below par or you're working in challenging conditions.

Then you throw your attention outwards, focusing on the people your work is for. You develop an awareness of how they respond, using the attentional capacity you have released by all that practice to notice and interpret the non-verbal cues of whoever you are with. Finally, you think about the impression you want them to take away when they leave. Your aim is to bring the encounter to a graceful close, with something you are proud to have achieved and the other person is glad to have experienced.

This chapter has explored that transition from gaining individual knowledge and skill to using that skill for the benefit of others. An initial ‘selfish' phase of becoming expert must give way to ‘sharing'. But until your skills have become second nature, you can't move beyond them to focus on your performance as a whole. If you can't make a coin vanish every time, you can't engage your audience. If you're not sure how to operate, you can't decide when to operate. If you feel insecure with fast passages when you're playing music in a group, you're not listening to the players around you or thinking about your audience. If you're trying to remember the seventeen causes of breathlessness, you're not able to hear what your patient is – and more importantly isn't – telling you. You may miss those tiny signals that give a clue to what is really going on.

Though this transition from you to them is easy to miss out, it's a crucial step as you start to develop your unique style. But shifting your focus from yourself to other people doesn't mean your own personality disappears. Quite the opposite, in fact. It's your personality that makes you the unique expert you're becoming. That's what we'll explore in the next chapter.

回到在诊室里面对萨拉的时刻。我必须决定下一步该做什么。我知道她在医学方面的需要 —— 验血、CT 扫描，并紧急转诊给专科医生。但是，这一切对她来说很难接受。我不想误导她。我不能告诉她一切都会好起来的，因为我很确定事实并非如此。我必须诚实。如果我是对的，她得了癌症，那么在接下来的几个月里，我们会经常见面。我们需要互相信任。我的责任是关照并塑造她生病的经历，还应确保这段经历尽可能地好。

要做到这一点，我必须按照她的步调行事，而不能强迫她与我步调一致。我需要给她时间和空间，保持安静、倾听。那么，我接下来该怎么做呢？

一开始我什么也没说，只是静静地坐着等待。然后她说：「我一直在想，这次会不会是更严重的问题。会不会……？」

过了一会儿，我说：「也许我们的想法是一样的。我可能错了，我希望我错了，但你告诉我的事情让我很担心，我们需要进一步地了解。我想安排一些检查，然后和医院的专科医生约个时间。你看怎么样？」

萨拉不情愿地叹了口气。「好吧，医生，」她说，「就这么办吧。」我们都知道这只是个开始，但至少我没有用萨拉没准备好接受的话来压垮她。

在我们交流的时候，萨拉告诉我，她觉得自己可能出了严重的问题，她有这个想法已经好一阵子了。她不想承认，因为生活中发生了很多其他的事情。她没有时间生病。她觉得自己无法面对严重的诊断可能带来的后果，因为有太多人依赖她了。

在就诊结束时，她让我安排了一些检查，并将她转诊给了一位专科医生。

事实证明她确实患有癌症，正如我们俩都怀疑的那样。从那时起，萨拉的治疗似乎就已经规划好了 —— 手术、术后康复、恢复。但是萨拉患上了胰腺癌，这就是她出现黄疸、眼白变黄的原因。胰腺恶性肿瘤是一种特别可怕的癌症，当她确诊时，我的心都沉了下去。

在接下来的几周、几个月内，萨拉和我的确经常见面。萨拉最害怕的不是痛苦，甚至不是死亡，而是被送进医院，孤身一人。她担心自己死后家人会怎么样。于是我们花了大部分时间讨论这些问题。她最需要的不是我的医学知识，而是说话的时间。

后来，我意识到我在帮助萨拉度过一段经历，而不是在治疗一种疾病。我能给她的最好关照，不是告诉她缓解癌症的药物背后的科学原理，也不是谈论她要接受的手术，或者测试结果与数据的技术细节。所有这些都有其作用，我需要理解这些，才能引导她做出决定。但是，我真正的任务是把注意力从这些技术问题上释放出来，用心倾听。我能提供的最好治疗，就是把注意力转移到她身上。

我们回顾一下我阐述的各项原则。首先，你会对工作的物质层面充满信心 —— 剪刘海、变戏法、制作西装上衣或做诊断。你要练习，练习，再练习，直到这件事成为你的第二天性。随着时间的推移，你会变得非常熟练，即使工作对象难以驾驭，即使你感觉状态不佳，即使你在有挑战性的条件下工作，你也能做好这件事。

然后你要把注意力向外转移，专注于你工作的受众。你要对他们的反应培养出一种觉察能力，利用你通过大量练习所释放出来的注意力，去注意和解读对方的非言语线索。最后，你要思考，在他们离开时，你希望给他们留下什么样的印象。你的目标是让这次相遇以圆满的方式结束，让你为自己取得的成绩自豪，并让对方为这段经历感到高兴。

本章探讨了从获得个人知识与技能到使用这种技能为他人造福的转变。成为专家最初的「自私」阶段，必须让位于「分享」。但是，在你的技能成为第二天性之前，你是无法超越技能层面、专注于整体表现的。如果你不能每次都成功让硬币消失，你就不能吸引观众。如果你不确定该如何做手术，你就不能决定何时做手术。如果你不能自如地在乐团中演奏快速乐段，你就无法倾听周围演奏者的演奏，也无法顾及听众的感受。如果你在试图回忆导致呼吸困难的 17 种原因，你就听不清患者告诉你的事 —— 更重要的是，你听不到他们没有告诉你的事。你可能会错过那些表示真实情况的微小信号。

虽然你很容易忽视「从你到他们」的转变，但这是你开始形成自己独特风格的关键步骤。不过，把专注点从自己转移到他人身上，并不意味着你自己个性的消失。事实恰恰相反。正是你的个性能让你成为未来独一无二的专家。这是我们下一章要讨论的内容。

## 0801. 找到自己的声音

0801 Developing voice

My consulting room door opens and Harry comes in. It's a busy morning at my Wiltshire practice; I've got a stack of patients waiting and I'm feeling under pressure. I've met Harry a couple of times, but I don't know him well. He's in his early seventies, with nicotine-stained fingers and a bit of a wheeze. As soon as Harry sits down, I ask him what the problem is. He tells me he's had a cough for several weeks, and he seems worried that there might be something more to it. He doesn't look well, and I feel a bit uneasy. I take out his notes, flicking through his medical history. I'm about to ask him some questions when the consultation freezes. My tutor has paused the tape.

I'm spending a week at a residential college for adult education. I'm on a course to become a GP trainer. If I'm successful, we'll be able to have trainees attached to our practice – doctors who have decided to become GPs themselves. They'll have spent several years working in a hospital as junior doctors, usually on six-month rotations like I did. They'll probably have worked in paediatrics, general medicine and perhaps psychiatry. Then they'll spend a year in a practice, learning on the job under the supervision of their GP trainer. There, they'll learn how different general practice can be from hospital medicine, and they'll spend a lot of time studying and practising the skills of consultation. Every week they'll have an afternoon with their trainer, discussing cases and honing their skills. At first, like me when I started, they'll probably feel rudderless and disoriented, swamped by patients with apparently trivial conditions but terrified of missing one with a serious disease. It will take them a while to understand what general practice is really about. That's where I'll come in as a trainer.

Supervising a trainee, like treating patients, requires a lot of skill. It starts with having insight into your own practice as a doctor. That's what we're learning on the course, and that's why we're starting by analysing our own consultations before helping our trainees with theirs. For most of that week I'm in a room with our tutor Clive, as well as five other doctors who are learning to become trainers. Clive's been a GP for decades, and he's got years of experience in training trainers. He doesn't say much, but his silences are more eloquent than words.

We're watching videos we've recorded over the last couple of weeks. Clive asked us to bring examples of ordinary consultations, not ones we're especially pleased with. But, of course, we've all chosen ones we're proud of. Nobody has brought anything disastrous, and we've each tried to slip in some that show how clever we've been. Like me, the other GPs think we'll be analysing these encounters and looking for diagnostic brilliance, medical knowledge, technical skill. But we don't. Instead, Clive is making us look at how we consult.

I've been in general practice for several years at this point, and I've become reasonably comfortable with consultations. But it has always been just me and my patient. There's been nobody else watching, let alone a group of my peers.

Now it's my turn to be in the spotlight, and I'm terrified. I feel my reputation is on the line. I'm waiting for Clive's comments about the likely cause of Harry's cough. Instead he looks at me thoughtfully and says, ‘I wonder how you're making Harry feel …' Then he sits quietly and waits.

诊室的门开了，哈里走了进来。这天早上，我在威尔特郡的诊室里忙着。有一大堆患者在等我，我感到压力很大。我见过哈里几次，但不太了解他。他 70 岁出头，手指上有尼古丁的黄渍，还有些气喘。哈里一坐下，我就问他有什么问题。他告诉我，他已经咳嗽几个星期了，他似乎在担心问题可能没有那么简单。他脸色不太好，我感到有些不安。我拿出他的文件，翻看他的病历。我正准备问他一些问题，这次问诊的录像就停住了。指导老师暂停了播放。

当时我要在一所成人教育的寄宿制大学里进修一周。我正在上全科医生师资课。如果我成功通过课程，我们的诊所就能招募实习医生了 —— 也就是决定做全科医学工作的医生。他们要在医院里做几年的实习医生，通常每六个月就要轮换科室，就像我当年一样。他们可能在儿科、普通内科或精神科工作过。然后他们会花一年的时间实践，在全科医生培训师的督导下，一边工作一边学习。在这个过程中，他们会学习全科与医院工作的不同之处，他们会花大量时间学习和练习问诊技巧。他们每周都会有一个下午的时间与培训师讨论案例、磨炼技能。刚开始的时候，他们就像当年的我一样，可能会感到目标不明、迷失方向，面对患者各种鸡毛蒜皮的症状不知所措，生怕忽视一个患有重病的患者。他们需要一段时间才能理解全科医学到底是怎么回事。所以他们才需要我这种培训师。

督导实习医生，就像治疗患者一样，需要许多技能。首先要对自己作为医生的工作有很深的了解。这就是我们在师资课程上学的东西，也是为什么我们在帮助实习医生之前要先分析自己的问诊方式。在那一周的大部分时间里，我都和我们的指导老师克莱夫以及其他五名学习成为培训师的医生待在一个房间里。克莱夫已经做了几十年的全科医生，有多年辅导培训师的经验。他话不多，但他的沉默比语言更有说服力。

我们正在看过去几周录制的录像。克莱夫让我们带来一些平常问诊的案例，而不是我们特别满意的案例。不过，我们肯定都选择让自己感到自豪的案例。没有带来什么糟糕的案例，我们每个人都试图上交一些让我们脸上有光的案例，以表明我们当时有多聪明。和我一样，其他全科医生也认为我们会分析这些问诊案例，指出那些绝妙的诊断、渊博的医学知识以及高明的技术能力。

但我们没有这样做。相反，克莱夫让我们审视我们是如何问诊的。此时我在全科医学领域已经工作好几年了，我对问诊也变得相当自如了。但一直以来，工作中就只有我和我的患者。没有其他人旁观，更不用说被一群同行旁观了。

现在轮到我站在聚光灯下了，我感到害怕。我觉得我的名誉岌岌可危。我在等待克莱夫对哈里咳嗽的可能原因发表评论。然而，他若有所思地看着我说：「我在想你会让哈里有什么感觉……」然后他静静地坐着，等我回答。

### 8.1 找到你的声音

Developing your voice

When Clive asked how I thought I was making Harry feel, he wasn't talking about the cause of his cough. He was talking about Harry's experience of being with me in my consulting room. From this perspective, a clinical consultation is an encounter between a professional performer (in this case, me) and an audience (in this case, Harry). The audience's experience of the performance is shaped by the performer's ‘voice'. That's what makes each doctor's style unique. In the previous chapter we looked at how you put yourself aside, focusing instead on your patient, your client or whoever your work is for. Now we'll look at how you bring yourself back in – how you develop voice.

Paul Haidet, a jazz musician and family doctor at Penn State College of Medicine in the United States, has studied this in detail. He writes about an expert's ability to ‘drop' what they have learned formally but still draw on it in the moment as they respond to what is happening around them. He sees parallels between medicine and music, too. As a jazz musician, you spend years with your instrument, practising scales, learning repertoire, mastering theory, developing techniques. But then the ones who make a mark, as Haidet puts it, are those ‘who channel the theory, technique and ideas of their predecessors through their own personalities, feelings and experiences'. This is what jazz musicians call ‘developing voice'. That's how you instantly recognize a recording of Miles Davis, Chet Baker or Freddie Hubbard from the first couple of notes, if you know that kind of music.

Jeremy Jackman, former counter-tenor in the King's Singers vocal ensemble, explained voice to me like this: ‘When you're a small child and your mother reads you a bedtime story, you get used to how she reads it. When your Aunt Ethel comes to stay and she reads you that story, the words are the same but the story sounds different. Her voice – not just literally, but how she interprets the words and the meaning – is unique. It's like that with music too.'

Something similar happens in all fields. My wife makes hats, and I can spot one of her hats in a room full of other people's. Similarly, if you gave me a page of writing by John le Carré, one of my favourite writers, I'd be able to know it was him rather than John D. MacDonald, whose crime novels I also devour. In your own work, whatever that may be, your voice is what differentiates you from your colleagues.

Voice dictates how you implement the ‘it's not about you' of the previous chapter. This is especially relevant in performances where your audience is very small. In medicine, that audience is often just one person. Even with a family consultation, it's seldom more than three or four.

Voice is how you tell one doctor from another. I had to learn how to recognize and acknowledge my voice as a doctor, and how to use that for my patients. In this chapter, we'll explore what happens when we think of experts as close-up live performers with a very small audience. We'll look at how to perform, and how developing your voice is part of becoming expert.

As doctors on that course for aspiring GP trainers, we'd passed the point where we were talking about medical knowledge. Anyone becoming a GP will already have spent years in the initial stages of becoming expert. They'll have done time and learned to touch, feel and see. They'll have made a lot of mistakes and put them right. They'll have grappled with the need to keep all that knowledge and skill out of view, to make the ‘it's not about you' transition we examined in Chapter 7 . But they may not have thought about voice. Yet voice is essential to performance. It captures your uniqueness, your style. Developing voice is something we all do as we internalize and transform what we've learned, and use it to become ourselves – whether as a plumber, an accountant or anything else.

当克莱夫问我让哈里有什么感觉时，他指的并不是哈里咳嗽的原因。他指的是哈里和我一起在诊室里的感受。从这个角度来看，临床问诊是专业表演者（在这个例子里，也就是我）与观众（哈里）之间的一次相遇。观众对于表演的体验是由表演者的「声音」塑造的。这就是为什么每个医生的风格都是独一无二的。在上一章里，我们讨论了如何把自己放在一边，把注意力放在患者、客户或你的任何工作受众身上。现在我们要讨论如何让自己回来 —— 如何找到自己的声音。

爵士音乐家、美国宾夕法尼亚州立医学院的家庭医生保罗·海德特（Paul Haidet）对这个问题进行了详细的研究。他曾写过，专家有能力「放下」自己正式学过的东西，但依然能在对周围发生的事情做出反应时利用这些东西。他也看到了医学与音乐之间的相似之处。作为一名爵士音乐家，你要花多年的时间演奏乐器、练习音阶、学习曲目、掌握乐理、锻炼技能。但是，正如海德特所说，那些被人记住的人，都是「借用自身个性、情感和经历表达前人的理论、技术和思想」的人。这就是爵士音乐家所说的「找到自己的声音」。这也是为什么你能通过最初的几个音符辨认出迈尔斯·戴维斯（Miles Davis）、查特·贝克（Chet Baker）或弗雷迪·哈伯德（Freddie Hubbard），国王歌手合唱团的前任假声男高音杰里米·杰克曼（Jeremy 如果你熟悉这类音乐的话。

Jackman）是这样解释「声音」的：「当你还是小孩子的时候，你妈妈会给你读睡前故事，而你会习惯她读故事的方式。你的埃塞尔姨妈来做客的时候，她也给你读了那个故事。文字是一样的，但故事听起来不同。她的声音是独一无二的 —— 不仅是指字面意义上的声音，还包括她对文字与含义的理解。音乐也是如此。」

所有领域里都有类似的事情。我妻子制作帽子，在一屋子别人的帽子里，我能认出哪一顶是她做的。同样地，如果你给我一页约翰·勒卡雷（John le Carré）的作品（他是我最喜欢的作家之一），我就能认出是他写的，而不是约翰·D. 麦克唐纳（John D.MacDonald）的作品 —— 我也很喜欢后者的犯罪小说。无论你的工作是什么，你在工作中的「声音」是让你不同于同事的原因。

「声音」决定了你如何实现上一章所说的「重点不在于你」。如果你的「观众」很少，这一点对于你的「表演」来说就尤其重要。在医疗工作中，「观众」通常只有一个人。即使是家庭问诊，也很少会超过三四个人。

「声音」是你区分不同医生的关键。我必须学会如何识别并注意到我作为医生的声音，以及如何将其用于为患者服务。在本章中，我们要探讨作为「近距离现场表演者」的专家为少量观众「表演」时会发生的事情。我们会探讨如何「表演」，如何在成为专家的道路上找到自己的「声音」。

作为有志成为全科医生培训师的医生，我们已经不再讨论医学知识了。任何一个成为全科医生的人，都已经在成为专家的初始阶段花了多年的时间。他们都有深厚的积累，都学会了触摸、感觉与观察。他们犯过错，也纠正过很多错误。他们都曾努力把所有知识和技能放在一旁，都做出我们在第 7 章探讨的「重点不在于你」的转变。但是，他们可能还没有思考过「声音」。然而「声音」对于「表演」来说至关重要。「声音」传达了你的独特性、你的风格。当我们内化和转化我们所学的东西，利用这些东西成为我们自己的时候，我们就会找到我们的「声音」—— 无论你是管道工、会计还是其他领域的工作者。

### 8.2 世上没有完美的西装

There's no such thing as a perfect suit

Joshua the tailor has voice too. He likes working with all kinds of customers, not just the straightforward ones; for Joshua, this is a challenge to relish. Unlike many of his contemporaries, he deliberately sought out difficult or unusual clients while he was training. Sometimes the challenges were physical – people with asymmetries, spinal deformities or differently shaped limbs. At other times the challenges were about personality – people who were aggressive or demanding, obsessed by detail or difficult to please. The other tailors were delighted when he took those customers, as it gave them an easier life.

Joshua's second apprenticeship was with Arthur, a master cutting tailor. It was Arthur who taught him the principles of designing a suit from scratch. That allowed Joshua to create something unique for each client, something that suited that man's personality and met his needs. After Arthur retired, Joshua left that tailoring house and set up his own business in partnership with his wife. That's when he established his voice as an independent craftsman. No longer constrained by bosses and colleagues, by ‘how we do things around here', he was free to bring together the skills he had learned and establish his own identity.

Early on in becoming a tailor, Joshua realized that there were many possible solutions to any problem. ‘There is no perfect suit,' he explained to me. ‘You are always striking a balance, a compromise between what the suit looks like on the hanger and what it feels like on the man. A garment is always an interpretation. You have to recognize and respond to people's instinctive reactions, whether they are aware of those reactions or not. Otherwise they won't be truly happy with what you create.'

Part of the satisfaction for Joshua was the clothes he designed, the end product of his work. But what excited him most was the opportunity to work with people and find out what they wanted. This is more difficult than it sounds.

With the freedom of developing your voice comes responsibility. As you stop being a cipher in someone else's workshop and develop your individuality as an expert, you accept responsibility for what you do. Once Joshua started his own business and could become the kind of tailor he wanted to be, he had to make it work. He had to live with the consequences of his decisions. During his years of doing time, learning to see and to do, he had absorbed and internalized the style of his masters. His work at that time was recognizably that of the tailoring house he was employed by, and he had the security of working in an organization. Now he was on his own, creating his own style and curating each client's experience of having a suit or jacket made by him. He was developing his voice.

By the time I started thinking of my voice as a GP, I was an experienced doctor. It was over twenty years since I'd started as a medical student, spending all those hours in a formalin-filled fug in the dissecting room and doing the bloods on a hospital ward. It was easy to forget how I'd struggled in those early days of doing time, learning to see and to touch, and the other steps I've described in this book. But, outside medicine, I was still going through those initial stages. And they came flooding back when I started to play my harpsichord.

裁缝约书亚也有自己的「声音」。他喜欢与各式各样的顾客打交道，而不仅仅是那些直截了当的人。对约书亚来说，这是一个值得享受的挑战。与那一辈的许多裁缝不同，他在学习的时候就故意寻找困难的、不同寻常的客人。有时这种挑战是身体上的 —— 有些客人的身体不对称、脊柱或四肢畸形。还有些时候，这些挑战是个性上的 —— 有些客人咄咄逼人、要求苛刻、过分关注细节或者难以满足。他接待这些顾客时，其他裁缝都很高兴，因为这让他们的工作更轻松了。

约书亚第二次做学徒时，他的老师是亚瑟，一名剪裁裁缝大师。亚瑟教会了他从零开始设计西装的原则。这让约书亚能够为每位客人创造一些独特的东西，适合那个人的个性、满足其需求的东西。亚瑟退休后，约书亚离开了他的裁缝店，与妻子合伙开了自己的店。从那时起，他就找到了自己作为独立匠人的「声音」。不再受老板和同事的限制，不再受「我们在这儿这么做事」的限制，他终于能够自由地把他学到的技能融会贯通，确立自己的身份认同了。

在刚开始学习裁缝的时候，约书亚意识到，任何问题都有许多可能的解决方案。「没有完美的西装，」他向我解释道，「你一直在寻找平衡，在西装挂在衣架上的样子和穿在一个人身上的感觉之间做出妥协。衣服是一种诠释。你必须意识到他人的本能反应，并做出回应 —— 无论他们意识到那些反应与否。否则他们就不会对你创造的东西真正地感到满意。」

让约书亚感到满足的部分原因是他设计的服装，他工作的最终产品。但最让他兴奋的是，他有机会与他人一起工作，发现他们想要什么。这比听起来要难得多。

随着你自由地寻找自己的「声音」，责任也随之而来。你不再是他人工坊里的无名小卒，而是开始发展自己个性的专家，你要为自己所做的事情承担责任。一旦约书亚创办了自己的裁缝店，能够成为他想成为的裁缝，他就必须做好自己的工作。

他必须承担他的决定所带来的后果。在积累的那些年里，他学会了看和做，吸收并内化了他师父的风格。他当时的工作明显带有他所在的裁缝店的风格，他所在的组织给予了他保障。现在，他创造了自己的风格，通过亲手制作西装套装或上衣来为每位客人的体验负责。他在寻找自己的「声音」。

在我开始考虑自己作为全科医生的「声音」时，我已经是一个经验丰富的医生了。从我开始学医起已经过去了 20 多年，那时我花了大量时间待在充斥着甲醛气味的解剖室里，以及在医院病房里采血。我很容易忘记在刚开始工作时，在学习观察、触摸时，以及在本书中描述过的其他阶段里的困难。但是，在医学之外，我依然会经历那些初始的阶段。在我开始弹奏羽管键琴的时候，那种感觉又像洪水一样涌了回来。

### 8.3 音乐与他人

Music and other people

Though I'd finished assembling my instrument from the kit, I barely knew how to play it. To begin with, I practised on my own and tried to get the hang of it. I'd learned the piano as a child and had taken up the pipe organ as a junior doctor, but I'd never played with other people. While the harpsichord has a huge solo repertoire, much of its music is performed in a group. It seemed a shame to keep my instrument to myself, though I was nervous about playing with others. So I took a deep breath, then signed up for a weekend residential course on baroque chamber music. I managed to squeeze my harpsichord into the car and I set off.

There were about thirty of us, all amateurs. Some, like me, were just beginning. Others were more experienced, and some were technically pretty advanced. Helping us to make sense of it all were three expert tutors. In the first session I found myself in a group with a cellist, a violinist and a recorder player. Our tutor gave us a pile of sheet music by composers I'd never heard of, and told us to get on with it. Sonatas, suites, dances – the pop music of its day. We didn't practise, we just played each one through at sight, then went on to the next. A lot of the pieces were repetitive and rather boring, but we played them anyway.

As a harpsichordist, I was in the continuo section. This is in the background most of the time, like the rhythm section in a jazz band. The cello plays the bass line as written by the composer, and the harpsichord fills in with harmonies. Continuo performers in the baroque period would have been expert at doing this, but I'd never played with others before, let alone tried to sight-read an unfamiliar piece.

Continuo playing gives a lot of freedom, as you're not expected to play only what's on the page. But there's also a lot of responsibility, because you have to fill out the bass line with chords, supporting but not competing with the others in the group. You play from a ‘figured bass' – numerical codes that tell you the harmonies the composer intended. It's like trying to do a crossword puzzle while reading aloud and cooking a soufflé at the same time. I wondered how I would cope. I was terrified of getting lost or playing a wrong note.

The first thing I learned was that nobody really cared what I played. They were all concentrating on their own parts, and they only became aware of me if I got in the way or made a blunder. I was like the mantelpiece clock that you only notice when it stops ticking. From being the centre of my own attention, I became someone who made a small twangly noise in the background. As one of the tutors put it: ‘Just keep going, Roger. Even if every note you play is wrong. As long as you start together and finish together, what happens in between isn't so important.'

Playing in that group made me listen – really listen – to the musicians around me. Instead of focusing on my hands, or on my skill (or lack of it) as a harpsichordist, I had to think how I would contribute. At first, I was scared that I'd lose my place and make an idiot of myself. Then I realized that sitting right next to me was an excellent cellist, and that we were playing the same bass line. If I felt overwhelmed, I knew that she would keep going, allowing me to skip a few bars and get back on the rails by listening to her. All I had to do was find my place, play the single bass line on the written page, and make sure I was in tempo with the other players. Then I could start to think about how to fill in the harmonies. To do that, I had to widen my attentional focus, to be aware of the ensemble as a whole and to listen.

At first I was happy to blend in without being noticed. But over time, something surprising happened. I became aware that I wasn't an interchangeable cipher; I was making an essential contribution after all. I realized that how I played was as important as what I played. I found I was developing a style, a way of playing that was recognizably mine. It wasn't just whether I played the right notes, but how I became part of the ensemble. I learned that less is more, that people valued the way I remained inconspicuous, didn't put in needless flourishes, avoided showing off. And the way I did that was distinctive. This was my voice.

I went to these workshops for several years running. One year, there were three of us harpsichord players. When we were deciding who would play with whom, a cellist I remembered from a previous course told me she'd like me to be in her group. ‘You're the one who listens,' she said. I felt very proud. I'd developed my own approach to continuo playing; I was starting to create my own style. Of course, I wasn't expert – far from it. Playing the harpsichord is a hobby for me, not a career. But I had made a transition that was immensely satisfying, and it made all those hours of practice worthwhile. I was able to play in my own way and be part of making music I'd always loved to listen to. My identity as a harpsichordist had moved up a level.

虽然我已经完成了羽管键琴的组装，但我几乎不知道该怎么弹。我先是自己练习，试图掌握其中的窍门。我小时候学过钢琴，在做实习医生的时候学过管风琴，但从来没有与他人合奏过。虽然羽管键琴有大量独奏曲目，但大部分曲目都是合奏的。虽然我对合奏感到紧张，但独自一人弹奏这件乐器似乎是一种遗憾。于是我深吸一口气，然后报名参加了一门巴洛克室内乐的寄宿制课程。我设法把羽管键琴塞进车里，然后就出发了。

这门课上大约有 30 个人，都是业余学员。有些人（比如我）才刚刚开始学。有些人更有经验，还有几个人的技术已经很高超了。有三位老师帮助我们学习这些东西。在第一节课上，我和一个大提琴手、小提琴手和竖笛手在一个组里。我们组的老师给了我们一堆我从未听说过的作曲家的乐谱，让我们开始练习。奏鸣曲、组曲、舞曲 —— 都是当时的流行音乐。我们没有练习，只是照着曲谱演奏一遍，然后演奏下一曲。很多曲子的旋律都是重复的，相当无聊，但我们还是演奏了。

作为羽管键琴手，我负责键盘低声部。这个声部在大部分时间里都是背景，就像爵士乐队里的节奏声部。大提琴负责演奏作曲家写的低音乐句，而羽管键琴负责填充和声。巴洛克时代的键盘低声部演奏者通常是专家，但我从来没有和别人一起演奏过，更没有试过视奏不熟悉的曲子。

演奏键盘低声部有很多自由，你不必完全按照乐谱演奏；但也有很多责任，因为你必须用和弦填充低音乐句，支持乐队里的其他人，而不是与之竞争。你要按照「数字低音」来演奏 —— 这是一种数字符号，告诉你作曲家想要的和声。这就好像要一边大声朗读，一边做填字游戏，一边做蛋奶酥一样。我不知道该怎么做到。我很害怕看错乐谱或弹错音符。

我学到的第一件事是，没有人真正关心我弹的是什么。他们都把注意力集中在了自己演奏的部分上，只有在我碍事或犯错时，他们才会注意到我。我就像壁炉上方的时钟，只有在停住的时候你才会注意到它。我不再把注意力放在自己身上，让自己变成了一个在背景里发出轻微拨弦声的人。正如其中一位老师所说：「继续弹，罗杰。即使你弹的每个音符都是错的，也要继续弹下去。只要你们一起开始，一起结束，中间发生的事情就不那么重要了。」

在乐队里演奏让我学会了倾听（真正的倾听）身边的演奏者。我不再专注于自己的双手，也不再关注我演奏羽管键琴的技巧（我也没什么技巧），我必须思考如何做出贡献。起初，我害怕我会跟不上大家，让自己出尽洋相。然后，我意识到，坐在我旁边的是一位出色的大提琴手，而我们演奏的是相同的低音乐句。如果我感到手忙脚乱，我知道她会继续拉下去，允许我跳过几个小节，通过听她的演奏回到正轨。我要做的就是找到自己的位置，弹奏乐谱上的低音乐句，确保自己与其他演奏者节奏一致。然后我就可以开始思考如何填充和声了。要做到这一点，我必须扩大我的注意力范围，注意整个乐队，用心倾听。

起初，我很高兴能融入团队而不被注意。但随着时间的推移，令人惊讶的事情发生了。我意识到我不是一个无足轻重的部分，而是做出了重要的贡献。我意识到，我演奏的方式与我演奏的内容一样重要。我发现我正在形成一种风格，一种属于我的鲜明演奏特点。这不仅仅在于我能否弹出正确的音符，更在于我如何成为乐队的一分子。我懂得了「少即是多」，懂得了大家珍视我的低调，不画蛇添足，不炫耀自己。我演奏的方式很独特。这就是我的「声音」。

我连续几年都在参加这种工作坊。有一年，工作坊里有我们三个羽管键琴手。当我们决定谁和谁一组时，有一个上次和我一同上课的大提琴手告诉我，她想让我和她一组。「你是个会倾听的人。」她说。我感到非常自豪。我找到了自己演奏键盘低声部的方式，我开始拥有了自己的风格。当然，我不是专家 —— 远远不是。弹奏羽管键琴是我的爱好，而不是职业。但我做出了一种非常让人满意的转变，让漫长的练习都变得值得了。我能用自己的方式弹琴，参与演奏我一直都喜欢听的音乐。我作为羽管键琴手的身份提升到了更高的层次。

### 8.4 问题之大

The immensity of the problem

Voice isn't only about what you say and how you say it. It involves all of the senses. It includes how you engage with people, how you relate to them, how you touch them and how you respond when they touch you. Voice shapes how you navigate the space between you and whoever you are with. It can also be expressed by how you configure the physical setting you work in. My GP partners and I put a lot of thought into how we designed the consulting rooms in our practice. We wanted our patients to feel comfortable and able to talk, but we also needed to be able to carry out clinical examinations. Each GP made different concessions, and their choices reflected their personality.

Staring at my own consulting room on the frozen video screen at the GP trainers course, Clive, the other doctors and I considered how it reflected my approach. Then we restarted my consultation with Harry about his cough. We watched another thirty seconds. On the screen, I was starting to listen to Harry's chest with my stethoscope. Clive suddenly paused the tape again and said, ‘Why are you doing that?'

I was nonplussed. Surely it was obvious. Listening with a stethoscope is part of making a diagnosis; it's what doctors do. The mantra of ‘inspection, palpation, percussion, auscultation' is so deeply embedded from my medical-school days that I'd never thought to question it. But Clive wanted to know what was going through my mind when I picked up my stethoscope – what I was planning to do next.

One of the other GPs said, ‘I use my stethoscope to buy time while I think what I'm going to say.' Another told us, ‘I use mine to reassure my patients that I know what I'm doing, that I've got knowledge and skill, so they trust me when I give them a diagnosis.' I hadn't thought of it like that before, but it made a lot of sense. Sometimes a stethoscope is just a stethoscope, but often it's more. A stethoscope is a symbol of our profession, and people expect you to use it.

Clive pointed out that we would all have managed this consultation differently and that we'd probably all be equally effective, despite our differences in approach. At medical school I'd been taught that each patient had a diagnosis and that our task was to find it. But for Clive, it wasn't as simple as that. He made me focus on my individual way of being a doctor, on my performance and my voice.

Developing voice is part of the Journeyman phase. It's when you shift from being able to do some of the things experts do to starting to become expert yourself. It's when you develop your own ways of responding to whoever you are with and dealing with the unexpected. But this needs a combination of humility and self-confidence, and that's a difficult balance to achieve.

As you develop voice, you're not abandoning what you have learned; you're reshaping it. As we saw with the music groups I took part in, you don't have to wait years for this to happen. The steps we've explored don't happen in strict linear order, and they often overlap. For instance, if you've already become expert in one area then it can help when you move into another, as Joshua found with his second apprenticeship. But all the time you're moving towards independence, towards becoming comfortable with your own way of doing things. You're creating an identity.

As you develop your voice, you realize that technical skill is necessary but not sufficient. It's how you apply that skill that matters. You must know a lot and be able to do a lot, but only bring out what's relevant in that moment. You must avoid showing off. Performers have known this for centuries. Staying with baroque music for a moment longer, C. P. E. Bach (one of Johann Sebastian Bach's many sons) wrote An Essay on the True Art of Playing Keyboard Instruments , published in 1753. Discussing technique and interpretation, he said: ‘Keyboardists whose chief asset is mere technique are clearly at a disadvantage … They overwhelm our hearing without satisfying it and stun the mind without moving it … A mere technician, however, can lay no claim to the rewards of those who sway in gentle undulation the ear rather than the eye, the heart rather than the ear, and lead it where they will.' The ability to sway the ear in gentle undulation is what an expert does.

Over two hundred years later, in 1966, the legendary jazz pianist Bill Evans recorded a conversation with his brother Harry in which they talked about Bill's approach to playing. He'd developed this a decade earlier, shutting himself up in his garage in 1954 for over a year to work on his technique. He went right back to basics, even though he'd already been playing professionally. In that conversation, Bill says:

The whole process of learning to play jazz is to take these problems from the outer level in, one by one, and to stay with it at a very intense, conscious-concentration level until that process becomes secondary and subconscious … Most people just don't realize the immensity of the problem and, either because they can't conquer it immediately, think that they haven't got the ability, or they're so impatient to conquer it that they never do see it through … They would rather approximate the entire problem than to take a small part of it and be real and true about it. To approximate the whole thing in a vague way gives you a feeling that you've more or less touched the thing, but in this way you just lead yourself toward confusion and ultimately you're going to get so confused that you'll never find your way out … If you try to approximate something that is very advanced and don't know what you're doing, you can't advance.

Evans puts his finger on something important here. As we develop our individuality, we watch and copy experts we admire. But until we have been through what they have been through, there's no point trying to copy their flourishes. Developing your voice emerges from the initial stages of hard graft and rigour, and you can't short-circuit the process. You can imitate experts, but you can't yet do what they are really doing. Like Bill Evans in his garage, you have to work that out for yourself.

Those senior consultants who listened quietly on a ward round when I was a young doctor, then came up with a new diagnosis, could only do that because of their years of experience. Those GPs who just seemed to ‘know' what questions to ask had gone through a similar process. As a trainee, I could imitate their behaviour as much as I liked, but I had nothing to base my pronouncements on. Your voice has to reflect an inner state of being expert, or you'll only be able to use it in circumstances you have already encountered. You'll struggle at the margins when things start to unravel. To be expert, your voice must remain recognizably yours, even when you are in situations you haven't encountered before.

That ability starts with the steps outlined in Chapters 1 to 5. You have to have spent months and years acquiring the skills of your craft or profession, getting them under your belt and making them second nature. You have to know that you can work to a consistent standard, and that you have mastered your core skills. You have to know you can give a good performance in any circumstances – even when you are feeling tired, out of sorts, or working with unruly materials under challenging conditions.

Voice is tied up with identity and confidence, with who and what you believe yourself to be. It wasn't until well after I qualified that I felt I had really ‘become' a doctor. Before that, I knew a lot of the things that doctors knew, and I could do a lot of the things that doctors did, but I hadn't become one myself. Gradually I became comfortable with my new identity – for a while, at least.

Then I started my surgical training and the same thing happened again. For years I would say ‘I'm training to become a surgeon', even when I was leading surgical teams in big, difficult operations. I hadn't yet settled into being a surgeon. Eventually that changed, and by the time I became a consultant ten years later, if someone asked me what I did I'd say, ‘I'm a surgeon.' The process repeated itself when I became a GP, and again when I became an academic. Voice isn't as straightforward as it sounds.

To be effective, voice must be authentic. You are drawing on aspects of yourself that are already there, not creating a new identity. You adapt and respond to each situation and the people that you're with. For instance, similar to my harpsichord playing style, I wanted to be a doctor who listened and responded to each patient's tempo. First I would fit in, and then start to shape the conversation. I might speed things up or slow them down. I would conduct the consultation while allowing my patient the freedom to express what they wanted. I would try to keep the whole context in mind, balancing the needs of the patient I was with and those of the others waiting outside.

「声音」不仅在于你说话的内容与方式。「声音」涉及所有的感官，包括如何与人打交道，如何与他们建立关系，如何触摸他们，以及在他们触摸你时如何回应。「声音」决定了你如何处理你与他人之间的空间。「声音」还能通过你布置工作的物理环境的方式得以表达出来。我和我的全科医生合伙人在设计诊室上花费了许多心思。我们希望患者感觉舒适，愿意说话，但我们也要能够进行临床检查。每位全科医生都会做不同的取舍，而他们的选择反映了他们的个性。

在那堂全科医生师资课上，克莱夫、其他医生和我盯着屏幕上暂停的录像，看着我的诊室，思考它如何反映了我的工作方式。然后，我们继续播放我那次关于哈里的咳嗽的问诊。我们又看了 30 秒。屏幕里的我开始用听诊器去听哈里的胸口。克莱夫突然再次暂停了录像，问道：「你为什么要这样做？」

我有些不知所措。这不是明摆着的吗？使用听诊器是做诊断的一部分。医生不就是干这个的吗？「视诊、触诊、叩诊、听诊」这一口诀在我上医学院时就已经深深地扎根于我的脑海了，我从没想过要质疑它。但是克莱夫想知道，在拿起听诊器时，我在想什么 —— 我打算接下来做什么。

有一位全科医生说：「我用听诊器是为了争取时间，思考我接下来要说什么。」另一位医生说：「我用听诊器是为了让患者相信我知道我在做什么，我有足够的知识和技能，这样在我给他们诊断时，他们就会相信我。」我以前从没这样想过，但听起来很有道理。有时听诊器只是听诊器，但它所代表的意义常常不止如此。听诊器是我们职业的象征，大家希望你用它。

克莱夫指出，我们都会用不同的方式来处理这次问诊，尽管我们的方式不同，但我们的方法可能同样有效。在医学院，我学到的是，每个患者都有一个诊断，而我们的任务就是找到这个诊断。但是对克莱夫来说，事情并没有那么简单。他让我关注我做医生的独特工作方式，关注我的表现和「声音」。

找到自己的「声音」，是熟练工阶段的一部分。在这个阶段，你不仅能做到一些专家做的事情，并且开始成为专家了；你还要形成与人打交道、处理意外情况的独特方式。但是，这既需要谦虚，又需要自信，这是一种难以达到的平衡。

在你寻找自己的「声音」时，你并没有放弃学到的东西，而是在重塑这些东西。从我参加的音乐小组课程中可以看出，你不需要等上很多年才会经历这个阶段。我们探讨的这些步骤不是按照严格顺序发生的，它们之间通常会有重叠。例如，如果你已经在一个领域里成为专家，这就有助于你进入另一个领域。约书亚在第二次学徒生涯中就发现了这一点。无论如何，你始终在走向独立，逐渐适应自己独有的做事方式。你在创造一种身份认同。

在你寻找自己的「声音」时，你会意识到，专业技能是必要但不足够的。重要的是你如何运用这些技能。你必须博学、能干，但只在适当的时候运用与状况相关的知识。你必须避免炫耀。表演者们在几个世纪前就明白了这一点。再看一个巴洛克音乐的例子，C.P.E. 巴赫（C.P.E.Bach，约翰·塞巴斯蒂安·巴赫的众多儿子之一）于 1753 年出版了《论键盘乐器演奏的真正艺术》（An Essay on the True Art of Playing KeyboardInstruments）一书。他在讨论技巧与诠释时说：「仅仅长于技巧的键盘乐器演奏家有一个明显的劣势…… 他们让我们的听觉不堪重负，却不能为之带来满足，让我们的心灵惊异不已，却能为之带来感动…… 然而，一介技工所获得的荣誉，绝对无法和那些不满足于迷惑人眼，而是用柔和平缓的乐音打动人耳乃至人心的人相提并论。」用柔和平缓的乐音打动人耳，正是专家的长处。

在两百多年后的 1966 年，传奇爵士钢琴家比尔·埃文斯（Bill Evans）录下了与哥哥哈里·埃文斯（Harry Evans）的一段对话。在这段对话中，他们谈到了比尔的演奏方法。他早在十年前就发明了这种方法。1954 年，他把自己关在车库里，花了一年多的时间去磨炼自己的技术。尽管他已经是职业钢琴家了，但他还是回到了基本功的训练中。在那段对话中，比尔说：

学习演奏爵士乐的整个过程，就是一个接一个地深入问题内部，让自己保持在非常强烈、非常专注的水平上，直到这个学习过程变成次要的，深入潜意识…… 大多数人都没有意识到整体问题之大，要么是因为他们无法立即完成这件事，认为自己没有这种能力；要么是因为他们操之过急，从没有把这件事情研究透彻…… 他们只愿意做到差不多的程度，不愿意把整件事分成许多较小的部分，真诚、认真地对待这一小部分。用「差不多」的态度对待整件事情，会让你觉得自己或多或少了解了这件事，但这样只会让自己陷入困惑，最终你会不知何去何从，永远找不到出路…… 如果你试图用「差不多」的态度对待很高深的问题，却不清楚自己在做什么，那你就不能进步。

埃文斯指出了一个重要的问题。在我们发展自己的个性时，我们会观察和模仿自己欣赏的专家。但是，没有他们的经历，却试图模仿他们的风格是没有意义的。只有在最初阶段里艰苦奋斗、严格要求自己，你才能找到自己的「声音」，没有捷径可走。你可以模仿专家，但你还做不到他们真正能做的事情。就像在车库里的比尔·埃文斯一样，你必须找到自己的出路。

在我还是个年轻医生的时候，那些资深的顾问医师会在查房时静静地倾听，然后提出一个完全不同的诊断。只有多年的经验才能让他们做到这一点。那些似乎「知道」该问什么问题的全科医生，也经历了类似的过程。在实习的时候，我可以尽情模仿那些医生的行为，但我的任何断言都缺乏根基。你的「声音」必须反映出一种专家的内在状态，否则你只能在以前遇到过的情况下使用你的「声音」。随着事情的发展，你可能就会力不从心。要成为专家，你的「声音」必须保持鲜明的个人特色，即使在你从未遇到过的情况下也是如此。

这种能力源于我们在第 1-5 章所概述的那些步骤。你必须花费数月乃至数年的时间锻炼专业技能，让这些技能烂熟于胸，成为你的第二天性。你必须有把握按照一致的标准工作，并且知道自己已经掌握了核心技能。你必须有把握在任何情况下都能表现良好 —— 即使在感到疲惫、心情不好，或者在有挑战性的情况下处理难以驾驭的工作对象时也是如此。

「声音」与你的身份认同和信心息息相关，与你心目中自己的本质与身份息息相关。直到取得医师资格很久之后，我才觉得自己真正成了一名医生。在那以前，我知道很多医生知道的事情，也能做很多医生能做的事情，但我自己并没有成为医生。渐渐地，我适应了自己的新身份 —— 至少在一段时间内如此。

然后我开始学习外科，相同的事情又发生了。多年以来，我一直说「我在接受外科的训练」，即使在我带领外科团队做大型、困难的手术时也是这样。我还没有习惯于做外科医生。这一切渐渐改变了。在我十年后成为顾问医师时，如果有人问我是做什么的，我就会说：「我是外科医生。」在我成为全科医生时，这个过程又重复了一遍。在我成为学者的时候也是如此。

找到「声音」并不像听起来那么简单。为了有效地指导工作，「声音」必须是真实的。你要借鉴自身已有的方面，而不是创造一个新的身份。你要适应并应对每一种情况，以及身边的其他人。例如，就像我演奏羽管键琴的风格一样，我想成为一个愿意倾听、及时回应每位患者的医生。

首先我会和患者搭上话，然后开始引导对话。我可能会加快谈话的节奏，也可能放慢速度。我会在主导问诊的同时，让患者自由地表达他们的想法。我会尽量顾全大局，平衡面前这位患者的需求与在外面等候的患者的需求。

### 8.5「声音」的隐秘陷阱

The subtle seductions of voice

At this stage in the path of becoming expert, you are learning to hold two aspects in creative tension: bedrock knowledge and performance in the moment. In the early stages, the emphasis is on knowledge, skills and joining a community of practice. As you start to fly solo, taking more responsibility for your own actions, your style and personality become more prominent. As we've seen, that's when your voice emerges. But there are pitfalls if your voice becomes too idiosyncratic and you lose touch with how it lands.

A patient going through the menopause told me she'd seen a female doctor about her symptoms. ‘Think of it like this,' the doctor had told her. ‘Your body is changing. You used to be a plum. Now you're becoming a prune.' I know what the doctor meant, but many people would have been offended by her choice of words. Fortunately, this patient found it hilarious. But voice is a double-edged sword. Because you are using your own personality as a tool, you need self-awareness and sensitivity to monitor how you come across to other people. You have to recognize that your way of putting things may not have the effect you intended.

When I was a medical student in Manchester, I spent time in an infertility clinic with a consultant gynaecologist. He'd start each consultation by explaining some basic medical facts. ‘Humans reproduce by eggs, like chickens,' he would say, ‘only human eggs are much smaller and they're inside. Do you understand?' On one occasion, the patient listened attentively without saying anything. For some reason, the consultant paused and asked her if she had a job. ‘Yes – I'm a lecturer, here at the university,' she replied. ‘What do you lecture on?' he asked. ‘Human reproductive biology,' she said. The consultant had the grace to look abashed for a moment, but then, alarmingly, he carried on with his spiel exactly as he had done a thousand times before.

Whether it's gynaecology or graphic design, it's no use having a ‘standard' approach. Salespeople know they can't use the same patter every time they pitch. That quickly becomes inauthentic, and prevents either party really listening. Your voice is not just what you say, or even how you say it. It's the means by which you engage – whether with a patient, client, colleague or customer. It's how you connect.

Experts' handling of voice can be impressive – a lot goes on under the surface. The most skilful GPs I ever met seemed able to put their finger on a patient's problem with no apparent effort. They weren't displaying medical knowledge, they were just listening – and maybe doing a little talking. They didn't drive things, or insist on asking questions in a specified order. They didn't show off. They seemed able to crystallize any problem without effort. Yet ask them afterwards what was going on and their language would switch in a flash. They would describe how they'd been considering this diagnosis or that, and weighing up the chances that it might be something serious. They'd talk about recent papers they had read, or how they were thinking about referring the patient to one specialist or another. They would have made contingency plans and put safety nets in place in case they'd got things wrong. Yet none of this was obvious. For their patients, the consultation was just something natural: a conversation that helped.

Joshua does something similar when he's with a client. He's quietly confident and competent, making sensible suggestions and helping each person navigate the many choices confronting them. But scratch the surface and you find his knowledge is encyclopedic. He's not only an expert in the design and construction of suits, he also knows about style and the history of fashion and materials. You wouldn't necessarily be aware of that, because he only brings it out when he needs it.

But voice can have a dark side too. Voice is so powerful that it can hide laziness or lack of knowledge. Its very power makes it open to corruption or abuse. Bravura performance can conceal ignorance, or mask unjustified self-confidence. If deficiencies in knowledge and skill are overcompensated for by dazzling performance, voice can morph into charisma or mere charm. Factual knowledge can fray, and skills degrade. I saw this with senior clinicians whose medical knowledge was drifting out of date but whose performance continued to improve. Their facility at a personal level concealed a disconnection from advances in the wider world. Most of the time little harm resulted, but the asymmetry in power between an apparent expert (the doctor) and an apparent non-expert (the patient) meant that such people often went unchallenged. Sometimes their lack of up-to-date knowledge led to disaster, and an important diagnosis was missed.

So, there is a fine line to tread. Too far in one direction and you are a mechanical dispenser of textbook information, purveying formulaic, preformed solutions which may not address the real problem. Too far in the other direction and it's all about you again, a self-indulgent focus on your personality and performance. Experts steer a path between these twin dangers – between suppressing their voice and relying on it too much. They avoid placing too much emphasis on personality and too little on knowledge and skill.

在成为专家的这一阶段，你会学习如何用创造性的方式把握这两个方面；基础知识与当下的表现。在早期阶段，你的重点是知识、技能以及加入实践社群。随着你独当一面，为自己的行为承担更多的责任时，你的风格和个性开始变得更加突出。

正如我们所见，这时你的「声音」就会显现出来。但是，如果你的「声音」变得太过特殊，而你却不顾及他人的感受，你就会陷入困境。

一位更年期的患者告诉我，她曾经向一位女医生咨询过她的症状。「打个比方，」医生对她说，「你的身体在发生变化。你过去像个梅子。现在你变成了梅子干。」我知道那位医生的意思，但许多人会被她的措辞所冒犯。幸运的是，这位患者觉得她的话很有意思。但是，「声音」是一把双刃剑。由于你将自己的个性用作工具，你就需要足够的自我意识与敏感性，来觉察你给别人留下的印象。你必须认识到，你待人接物的方式可能不会起到你想要的效果。

在我还是曼彻斯特大学的一名医学生时，我曾在一家不孕不育诊所与一名妇产科顾问医师工作过一段时间。他每次问诊时都会解释一些基本医学知识。「人类靠卵子来繁衍后代，就像鸡一样，」他会这样说，「只不过人类的卵要小得多，而且在体内。你明白吗？」有一次，患者认真地听了他的话，但什么也没说。不知为何，医生停下来问她有没有工作。「有，我在这里当大学讲师。」患者答道。「你教什么？」医生问道。「人类生殖生物学。」她说。医生还算有些风度，露出了羞怯的神色，但让人不舒服的是，他又开始滔滔不绝地讲了起来，就像他以前无数次做过的那样。

无论是在妇产科还是平面设计中，「标准」的工作方法是无效的。销售人员知道他们不能在每次推销时都用同一套话术。这种说法很快就会变得不真诚，让双方都无法真正地倾听。你的「声音」不仅在于你说的内容，甚至不仅在于你说的方式。它是你打交道的方式 —— 无论对方是患者、客户、同事还是顾客。这是你与人联结的方式。

专家对「声音」的处理让人佩服 —— 表面之下还有许多东西。我所见过的最老道的全科医生似乎能毫不费力地指出患者的问题。他们不是在展示医学知识，只是在倾听 —— 也许会说上几句话。他们不催促，也不坚持按照特定顺序提问。他们不炫耀。他们似乎能毫不费力地把任何问题弄得一清二楚。然而，如果事后询问他们当时发生了什么，他们的语言会立即发生变化。他们会阐述自己是如何考虑这种或那种诊断的，并思考患者有多大可能性患上了重病。他们会谈到最近阅读的论文，或者他们在考虑把患者转诊给这位或那位专科医生。他们会制订应急计划，采取保障措施，以防出错。然而，这一切都是难以察觉的。对于患者来说，就诊只是一件很自然的事情：一次有帮助的对话。

约书亚与顾客在一起时也会做类似的事情。他很自信，也很有能力，能给每个人提供明智的建议，帮助他们权衡面临的众多选择。但只要透过表象，你就能发现他的知识非常渊博。他不仅是西装设计和制作方面的专家，而且还了解时装和布料的风格与历史。你不一定能看到这一点，因为他只在需要的时候才显露出这一面。

但是「声音」也有阴暗的一面。「声音」有强大的力量，可以隐藏懒惰与知识的缺乏。「声音」的力量使其容易变质或遭到滥用。虚张声势的表演可以隐藏无知，掩盖毫无根据的自信。

如果知识与技能上的不足以花哨的表演来过度弥补，「声音」就会变成魅力或单纯的诱惑力。事实性知识会遗忘，技能会退化。

我在有些资深医生身上见过这种情况。他们的医学知识已经过时，但他们的表演能力却在不断提升。他们个人的魅力掩盖了这样的事实：他们与更广阔世界的进步脱节了。大多数情况下，这种做法不会造成什么伤害，但表面上的专家（医生）与表面上不是专家的人（患者）之间的权力差异，意味着前者通常不会受到质疑。有时他们新知的缺乏会酿成大错，导致严重的误诊。

因此，这里有一个很微妙的平衡。如果你走向一个极端，就只会照本宣科，提供死板的、预先制定好的解决方案，这可能并不能解决真正的问题；走向另一个极端，就会让所有的事情都以你为中心，任性地把自己的个性与表现看作重中之重。专家能在这两种危险之间找到一条出路 —— 既不压抑自己的「声音」，也不过分依赖「声音」。他们会避免过多强调个性，而忽视知识与技能。

### 8.6 既不标新，也不守旧

Neither the first nor the last

One of the benefits of age and experience is the wisdom which allows experts to cast a sceptical eye over the latest trends and fashions. This avoids being swept up in a froth of enthusiasm, and ensures that decisions are tempered by common sense. It makes me think of Alexander Pope's adage in his Essay on Criticism , which was often quoted to me when I was a medical student.

In words as fashions the same rule will hold;

Alike fantastic, if too new, or old:

Be not the first by whom the new are tried,

Nor yet the last to lay the old aside.

Yet it can be difficult to distinguish this balanced, healthy scepticism from being too lazy to learn new techniques or keep abreast of new technologies. It's often said that our world privileges information over knowledge, and knowledge over wisdom. The ability to stay calm, take the long view and be thoughtful about embracing new technologies is increasingly rare and valuable. Level-headed guidance about what to believe is important now more than ever. For that, we need the wisdom of experts – in medicine and everywhere else.

We trust people, not faceless dispensers of facts. It's through someone's voice – their style, their individuality, their capacity to relate to us as individuals – that we decide whether or not to give them that trust. One doctor, one hairstylist, one tailor, is not the same as another.

Experts have a responsibility not to abuse our trust, nor hide behind it to conceal slothfulness, malign intent or self-interest. All these things happen. Close-up magicians can become cheats and card sharps; well-known artists can pass off pieces of shoddy quality because their work is sought after; surgeons can do unnecessary operations to supplement their income. Such a misplacing of true purpose is a corruption of the responsibility of care, as we saw earlier with the surgeons who liked to ‘cut'. This is the dark side of the switch from you to them – a distortion which moves the focus back from them to you. It's an abuse of the power of voice.

Back to Harry and his cough. A few weeks after my time at the GP trainers course, he comes to see me in my surgery; then again a short time after that. I've been thinking a lot about him in the meantime. Something is obviously bothering him, but I can't work out what. I try to think what might lie behind his repeated visits. The next time he comes I try a different tack. On an earlier occasion he mentioned Ethel, his wife, but didn't say much about her. I have a feeling there might be more. ‘You know when we were talking the other day and you told me about Ethel …?' I begin.

I stop talking and wait. In a few moments, it all comes pouring out. It turns out that it isn't Harry's cough that's been worrying him most. It is Ethel, who is bed-bound at home. He's terrified that if something serious happened to him, she'd be stranded and there'd be no one to take care of her. So although in a way he does want to know what's wrong with him, in another way he doesn't. From then on, our conversations are different and we're able to think of possible solutions. In the end, Harry agrees to have an X-ray and some other tests. It turns out he has emphysema but fortunately no cancer. Still, we spend most of our time talking about Ethel, and I think these conversations help him as much as treating his cough.

Going back to those weekends of baroque music, I realized that I didn't have to be a virtuoso to express my voice at the harpsichord. Just as well, as I never will be. In that setting, it was more important to blend in with others, to contribute without seeking the limelight and – to paraphrase Bill Evans – to know that the problem is large, that I have to take it a step at a time and to enjoy this step-by-step learning procedure.

If you've reached this point in your path to becoming expert, you have arrived at a watershed. For a great many people, like me with my harpsichord, this is enough. I'm able to play to a standard that pleases me. If you want to go further, you can take the next step. But moving from here to becoming truly expert may well be the greatest leap of all.

年龄与经验的增长带来的一个好处就是智慧。智慧能让专家用怀疑的眼光看待当下的流行趋势。这样做能避免被虚妄的狂热所裹挟，确保自己做的决定符合常识。这让我想起了我在医学生时代常听到的亚历山大·蒲柏（Alexander Pope）《批评论》（Essay on Criticism）中的格言。

文字与时尚的道理一样，标新与守旧同样荒唐：既不要率先尝试新异，也不要最后抛弃故旧。

然而，要将这种平衡、健康的怀疑态度与懒于学习新技术、不愿跟上技术进步区分开来，是很困难的。大家常说，在我们的世界里，信息比知识重要，知识比智慧重要。保持冷静、着眼长远，审慎对待技术进步的能力越发显得罕见而可贵。关于我们应该相信什么，头脑冷静的指引比以往任何时候都更加重要。为此，我们需要专家的智慧 —— 医学与其他任何领域都是如此。

我们信任的是人，而不是那些面目不明的信息传播者。通过一个人的「声音」（他们的风格、个性，以及作为一个人与我们建立联结的能力），我们才能决定是否信任他。每个医生、发型设计师和裁缝都是与众不同的。

专家有责任不滥用我们的信任，不利用我们的信任隐藏懒惰、恶意与私欲。这些事情都可能会发生。近景魔术师可能变成骗子或在打牌时作弊；知名艺术家也可能用质量低劣的作品蒙混过关，因为他们的作品很受欢迎；外科医生也可能会做没必要做的手术来增加收入。这种动机不纯的现象，是因为「关心他人」的责任心变质了，正如我们之前看到的喜欢「开刀」的外科医生一样。这是「从你到他们」的转变的反面 —— 关注点从他人身上转移回到了自己身上。这是在滥用「声音」的力量。

回到哈里和他的咳嗽上来。在我参加全科医生师资课的几周之后，哈里来我的诊室找我了，他不久之后又来了一次。与此同时，我也一直在想着他。显然他心里有些事情，但我不知道是什么。我试图弄清他为什么多次来访。在下一次他来的时候，我试着采取了不同的策略。在此之前，他提到过他的妻子埃塞尔，但没有多说。我感觉其中有些隐情。「你还记得那天我们谈话的时候，你跟我提起了埃塞尔吗？」我开口说道。

我停下来等他说话。不一会儿，他就滔滔不绝地说了起来。原来哈里最担心的并不是他的咳嗽，而是卧床不起的埃塞尔。他很害怕，如果他生了重病，埃塞尔就会被困在家里，没人照顾她。所以，他既想知道自己出了什么问题，又不想知道。从那以后，我们的谈话就发生了变化，我们能够思考可能的解决方案了。最后，哈里同意做 X 光和其他检查。结果发现他患有肺气肿，还好他没得癌症。尽管如此，我们还是花了大量时间谈论埃塞尔，我认为这些谈话给哈里的帮助，不亚于对其咳嗽的治疗。

回想那些学习巴洛克音乐的周末，我意识到，要用羽管键琴发出自己的声音，我并不需要成为一名演奏大师。当然，我也永远成不了大师。在那种情境下，更重要的是融入集体，在不吸引关注的情况下做出贡献，以及（用比尔·埃文斯的话来说）意识到「问题之大」，意识到我必须一步步地前进，享受这种循序渐进的学习过程。

如果你已经在成为专家之路上走到了这里，说明你已经来到了一个分水岭。对于很多人来说，走到这里就足够了，就像学习羽管键琴的我一样。我的演奏达到了一定的水准，我已经很满意了。如果你想走得更远，就可以更进一步。但是，从这里走向真正的专家，可能是一次最大的飞跃。

## 0901. 学会随机应变

0901 Learning to improvise

Back to South Africa in the 1980s and another emergency in the operating theatre. This time my patient is Themba, a young man with a small stab wound in the side of his neck near the angle of his jaw. He's anaesthetized on the operating table and I'm about to begin. It's a busy Saturday intake and several theatres are running at once. The other surgeons are on call, operating on their own patients. I've been at Bara for over two years now and I've reached the stage where I should be able to do an operation like this on my own. But, as I discovered when I was operating on Jonas (see Chapter 6 ), the neck can be treacherous territory.

We clean and drape Themba, then I make an incision along the line of his sternomastoid, the muscle that runs from behind the ear to the breastbone. I'm excited and terrified. At the best of times, a stabbed neck is a challenge. You never know what you'll find – the size of the wound and the extent of the damage can be wildly out of proportion. Mentally, I go over what I might encounter: the strap muscles, nerves and blood vessels.

As soon as I start the operation I realize I'm in for a nasty shock. None of the structures I'd learned about from books and in the dissecting room seem to be there. No tidy strap muscles, no arteries and certainly no nerves. Those little buggers in the neck I spent so long memorizing have disappeared. It's all just a horrible squidgy mess, and everything I touch oozes blood. The knife must have punctured a major artery which is now pumping blood into the tissues of the neck and obliterating familiar landmarks.

What if I can't handle the situation, if I can't find the injury? What if other crucial structures have been divided? What if I damage something vital during the operation? What if Themba bleeds to death on the operating table? I've never encountered a situation like this before, so I'll have to improvise. But how?

回到 20 世纪 80 年代的南非，手术室里又出现了一个紧急情况。这次我的患者是滕巴。这个年轻男子的脖子侧面靠近下巴的倾斜处有一道小小的刺伤。他躺在手术台上，已经被麻醉了，我正要开始做手术。那是一个繁忙的周六，几个手术室里都在同时进行手术。其他外科医生也都在工作，为各自的患者做手术。我在巴拉瓜纳医院已经工作两年多了，已经到了可以独立做这种手术的阶段。但是，正如我在给乔纳斯做手术时（见第 6 章）发现的那样，脖子是一个很危险的区域。

我们给滕巴消了毒、盖上了手术巾，然后我沿着他的胸锁乳突肌切了一个口子。这是一块从耳朵延伸到胸骨的肌肉。我既兴奋又害怕。在最幸运的情况下，脖子上的刺伤只是一个挑战，但你永远不知道你会发现什么 —— 伤口的大小与损伤的程度可能远远不相符。我在心里回想可能会遇到的东西：各种带状肌、神经和血管。

手术一开始，我就意识到我会大吃一惊。我从书本上和解剖室里了解到的结构似乎都不见了。没有整齐的带状肌，没有动脉，当然也没有神经。我花了那么长时间记住的脖子里的「小东西」也消失了。只有一片模糊的血肉，既可怕，又滑腻，我触碰的一切都在出血。那把刀肯定刺穿了一条大动脉，那条动脉现在把血液输送到了颈部的组织了，模糊了熟悉的参照点。如果我处理不了这种情况，如果我找不到伤口，那该怎么办？如果还有其他重要的组织结构也被切断了，那该怎么办？要是我在手术中损坏了某些重要的东西怎么办？如果滕巴在手术台上失血而死呢？我以前从没遇到过这种情况，所以只能随机应变。可我该怎么做呢？

### 9.1 随机应变的艺术

The art of improvisation

At this point, you've reached the next cusp on the trajectory of becoming expert. You've done time, used your senses and have a fully operational mise en place. You're a seasoned professional, a Journeyman who recognizes that ‘it's not about you', and you've developed your own style or voice.

In this chapter, we'll explore how you develop the higher-order skills of responding to the complex demands of a rapidly evolving situation – in a word, improvising . Part of this is how you come up with solutions that get you out of trouble. But being able to improvise is more than that. Improvising is what experts do – it's what makes experts expert. And that's across the board: in every field of activity, experts have to improvise.

Years after that operation on Themba, I was in the audience during a gig at the London Jazz Festival when something went wrong. I was listening to a trio – piano, bass and tenor sax – and they were playing new material written by the pianist. They had handwritten sheets on their music stands. The pianist was facing away from the audience, the bass player was at the back of the stage and the saxophonist at the front. Halfway through the first set, I became aware of a brief hiccup in the rhythm, a sense of something unexpected. Almost immediately, everything settled down, and I wouldn't have given it a second thought if the bass player hadn't spoken up after the number to explain what had happened.

Although he and the pianist had played together before, he told us, they had never worked with this saxophonist and they hadn't had a chance to rehearse. Halfway through the number, the bass player noticed that his written part had some extra bars and he was getting out of sync with the others. Realizing that there must be a transcription error, he had to act fast. So he'd looked over to the sax player's music stand, transposed what he saw into the bass clef and continued playing. A combination of swift thinking and sangfroid, rooted in decades of experience.

Though the stakes were very different, the bass player's description took me back to that scary night in Soweto when I was operating on Themba's stabbed neck. It made me think that a jazz band is like a surgical team, encountering the unexpected and responding as a group. Then I started to think not in terms of surgery or music, but of improvisation as a characteristic of being expert, something that could apply to any field. I began to wonder whether insights from other experts might shed light on the excitement and terror of dealing with the unexpected.

When you're talking about jazz and you use the word ‘improvisation', people usually think about the music. They might imagine a trumpet player stepping to the front of the stage, picking up a musical theme and taking it in new directions, responding in the moment to ideas that seem to come from nowhere. They think of improvisation as something spontaneous, effortless and requiring very little preparation. Most of the time that couldn't be further from the truth. That may be what it looks like, but it's not what's going on beneath the surface.

Improvisation is based on years of hard graft. It builds on all the steps I've explored in the book so far. It starts with doing time, using your senses and working within a system. In addition to practising, learning to listen, getting things wrong and putting them right, improvisers have to have made the transition ‘from you to them'. For a musician, the ‘them' is the other musicians they're playing with and the audience they're playing for. At the same time they've developed their voice, the unique style that makes them the experts they are becoming. But improvising isn't an occasional departure from being able to do things properly. Improvising is being able to do things properly. Being able to improvise effectively is a high point of becoming an expert.

When I was watching that jazz band, there was already plenty of improvisation going on in their performance. Improvisation is an inherent part of jazz music – not all of the music is written out; the musicians have to come up with something on the spot. This is where all those hours of practice and theory come in. Knowing which notes in a melody will work with the underlying harmony – and stringing them together into something expressive or moving – can only happen when the production of each note is second nature. The ability to play jazz music, I would say, is having expertise. But what I saw on that day was something even more impressive. When it became clear that the expectations underpinning the improvisation had been broken, the bassist was able to come up with a solution in the moment in a way that his colleagues understood and most of the audience weren't aware of. That, I would say, is being expert.

Some improvisation takes your breath away. On 24 January 1975, the American jazz musician Keith Jarrett played a concert at the Cologne Opera House. It's now seen as a tour de force of improvisation, and has gone down in history as a landmark performance. But the Köln Concert (as it's usually known) almost didn't happen. Jarrett was in the middle of a gruelling schedule of solo concerts, eleven of them in Europe. They were billed as extended improvisations, not variations on something already composed; Jarrett's intention was to create everything he played from scratch. He'd given one of these performances a night or so earlier in Switzerland, and 24 January was supposed to be an evening off. But an opportunity came up for a late-night concert in Cologne and Jarrett agreed to do it.

Jarrett was understandably particular about the pianos he performed on. For this concert, he specified a full-sized concert grand. But when he arrived at the Cologne Opera House, he found an inferior substitute: a small, out-of-tune instrument which was barely playable. Jarrett was livid and almost cancelled the concert. But more than 1,400 tickets had already been sold, and he reluctantly agreed to go ahead. By then, Jarrett was in poor shape. Exhausted by his punishing schedule, tired from travelling, wearing a brace for severe back pain and faced with an instrument he hated, everything seemed to be going wrong.

Finally, the audience took their seats, ushered in by four notes of the Opera's intermission bell. When Jarrett walked onto the stage and sat down at the piano, the first notes he played seemed oddly familiar. They were the notes of the intermission bell, and he used them as his starting point for improvisation – his way into his playing. Listen very carefully to the recording and you can hear the audience chuckle in recognition.

Then, for over an hour, Jarrett held that audience spellbound as he spun the most remarkable web of expressive musical ideas into a coherent, and deeply moving, piece – all the while grappling with that second-rate, under-powered piano. He had to adapt his usual technique to its idiosyncrasies, making it reach the gallery by pounding the keys much harder than he normally would. Technically, as well as musically, he surpassed himself. Somehow all those challenges resulted in something magical. The recording of the Köln Concert became one of the most successful albums in jazz history, selling over three million copies.

Jarrett's remarkable performance captures the essence of being expert. He had decades of study, practice and experience in performing. He had specialized in improvising musically. But on that occasion in Cologne, he did something even more remarkable. He responded to a unique situation, to the stresses of ill health and tiredness, to the inadequacies of the piano and his irritation at finding his requests ignored. Instead of narrowing his attentional focus, he widened it, even to the point of noticing and incorporating the four notes of the intermission bell. To me, that's improvisation of the highest order – an example of true mastery.

现在你到了成为专家之路上的另一个转折点。你积累了经验，学会了运用感官，并且做了充分的、实用的「准备工作」。你是一个经验丰富的专业人士，一个熟练工。你能认识到这件事的「重点不在于你」，你也形成了自己的风格或「声音」。在这一章里，我们将探讨如何培养更高级的技能，来应对快速变化的情况的复杂要求 —— 也就是随机应变。这是你如何想出解决方法、摆脱困境的一部分。但是随机应变的能力远不止于此。随机应变是专家的能力 —— 是他们成为专家的关键。在任何领域都是如此：每个领域的专家都要随机应变。

在我给滕巴做手术的多年以后，伦敦爵士音乐节的一场演出出了一些问题，而我正在台下。我正在听一场钢琴、贝斯与高音萨克斯的三重奏，他们正在演奏这位钢琴手创作的新曲目。

他们的乐谱架上放着手写的乐谱。钢琴家背对着观众，贝斯手在后面，萨克斯手在前面。第一组乐曲演奏到一半的时候，我意识到旋律中有一个短暂的停顿，有一种意料之外的感觉。几乎在一瞬间内，一切都恢复了正常。要不是贝斯手在演奏完这一曲后解释刚刚发生了什么，我根本不会多想。

他告诉我们，虽然他和这位钢琴手曾一起演奏过，但他们从没有和这位萨克斯手一起合作过，也没有机会排练。演奏到一半的时候，贝斯手发现，他的乐谱里多写了几个小节，他与其他乐手不同步了。他意识到这一定是抄写错误，不得不迅速采取行动。所以他看向萨克斯手的乐谱架，把他看到的内容转换成低音谱号的谱子，然后继续演奏。这是敏捷思维与冷静头脑的组合，其背后有着数十年的经验。

尽管我们面临的风险不同，但这位贝斯手的叙述让我想起了我在索韦托给滕巴做手术的那个可怕夜晚。他的话让我想到，爵士乐队就像外科手术团队一样，在遇到意想不到的事情时，大家要协同一致、做出反应。接下来我想到的不是手术或音乐，而是随机应变这种专家特征，这种能力适用于任何领域。

我开始想，其他专家的见解能否阐释这种应对意外事件的兴奋与恐惧。

在谈论爵士乐时，说到「随机应变」，大家通常会想到音乐的即兴表演。他们可能会想象一个小号手走到舞台前，选择一个音乐主题，跟随着此刻不知从何而来的灵感，演奏出意想不到的旋律。他们认为随机应变是一种自发的、毫不费力、不需要准备的事情。在大多数时候，这与事实相去甚远。这也许是表面上的样子，但事实并非如此。

随机应变建立在多年艰苦努力的基础之上，建立在我至此探讨过的所有步骤的基础之上。随机应变始于积累、运用感官、在系统内工作。除了练习、学会倾听、犯错与纠错之外，随机应变者还需要做出「从你到他们」的转变。对于音乐家来说，「他们」是与自己一起演奏的其他音乐家，以及他们的听众。与此同时，他们还要找到自己的「声音」，也就是让他们成为专家的独特风格。但是，随机应变不是一种偶尔偏离行为规范的做法。它就是把事情按照规范做好。能够有效地随机应变，是成为专家的一个重要方面。

在观看那个爵士乐队演出时，他们的演奏里已经有很多随机应变了。随机应变是爵士乐固有的一部分 —— 并非所有的音乐都写在了乐谱里；音乐家必须在当下想出一些新东西。他们花在练习和学习理论的那些功夫，就在这时派上了用场。只有在作曲成为第二天性之后，他们才能知道在旋律中加入哪些音符才能与基本的和声相符，并将这些音符串成有表现力、能感动人的音乐。在我看来，演奏爵士乐的能力就是一种专长。不过我那天看到的表演则更令人佩服。当随机应变的基础 —— 预期被打破时，贝斯手立即想出了搭档们能理解而观众却不知道的解决方案。我认为，这堪称专家。

有些随机应变能让你瞠目结舌。1975 年 1 月 24 日，美国爵士音乐家基思·贾勒特（Keith Jarrett）在科隆歌剧院举办了一场音乐会。在今天看来，这场表演是随机应变的代表，并且作为里程碑式的表演而名垂史册。但是，这场科隆音乐会（现在的通称）差点没办成。贾勒特当时正忙于一系列令人筋疲力尽的个人音乐会，其中有 11 场都在欧洲举行。他们宣称这些表演都是彻底的即兴表演，而不是对已经谱好的曲目进行变奏。贾勒特的目的是从零开始创作他所演奏的一切。他之前在瑞士的一个晚上做过这样的表演，而 1 月 24 日晚上，他本来应该休息。

但是面对在科隆举办深夜音乐会的机会，贾勒特表示了同意。贾勒特对于表演用的钢琴非常挑剔，这是可以理解的。为了这场音乐会，他指定要求使用一台全尺寸的音乐会大钢琴，但当他到达科隆歌剧院时，他却发现了一台次等的替代品：一台走调的小钢琴，几乎不能演奏。贾勒特怒不可遏，差点取消了音乐会。然而 1400 多张票已经售出，他只能勉强同意演出。

那时，贾勒特的状态很糟糕。繁重的日程安排压得他筋疲力尽，旅途让他疲惫不堪，因为严重背痛而戴着护腰，再加上他讨厌的乐器 —— 一切似乎都不对劲。

终于，在歌剧院四个音符的铃声的引领下，观众坐在了自己的座位上。贾勒特走上舞台，坐在了钢琴前。他演奏的前几个音符似乎很熟悉。那是歌剧院的铃声，他把铃声作为即兴表演的起点 —— 作为他开始演奏的方式。仔细听那场演出的录音，你可以听到观众会心的窃笑。

然后，在一个多小时的时间里，贾勒特将富有表现力的音乐灵感汇聚成了一曲连贯、感人的杰作，让观众为之着迷 —— 而他一直演奏的乐器却是那台二流的、音量不足的钢琴。他必须根据这台钢琴的特点调整他惯常的技巧，比平常更用力地敲击琴键，才能让声音传到楼上的观众席。无论在技术上还是音乐上，他都超越了自己。不知为何，所有这些挑战产生了神奇的结果。科隆音乐会的录音成了爵士乐史上最成功的专辑之一，销量超过了 300 万张。

贾勒特的杰出表演凸显了专家的本质。他花了几十年的时间学习、练习和表演。他擅长即兴创作音乐。但是在那次科隆的表演中，他做了一件更了不起的事情。他面对的是一种更特殊的情况：健康状况不佳与疲劳的压力、钢琴的质量不佳以及他发现自己的要求被忽视时的愤怒。他的注意力范围没有因此而缩小，反而扩大了，甚至他还注意到并运用了铃声的四个音符。在我看来，这是最高级别的随机应变 —— 真正的大师级的例子。

### 9.2 随机应变与表现

Improvisation and performance

Improvisation and performance are inseparable. Yet the word ‘performance' makes many people uneasy. To them, it sounds like doing something that isn't real, that is somehow inauthentic – even faking it. I disagree radically. After all, nobody criticizes a pianist for giving a performance of a Beethoven concerto, something they have spent years studying and practising for.

Performance doesn't only happen on a stage. We talk about performing operations, performing procedures and performing experiments, as well as performing concertos and plays. For a musician, an actor or a dancer, performance is what it's all about. But it is just as important in medicine and science. And improvisation is an essential part of any performance.

Improvising is how you apply what you have learned, creating solutions in the moment and responding to what is happening around you. Yet the idea of improvisation, like the idea of performance, often unsettles people. It sounds unprofessional, a solution knocked up on the spur of the moment, like an improvised bookshelf made with a plank and some bricks or an improvised shelter in the rain. But I think it's a priceless skill. That shelter in the rain may have been jury-rigged, but it keeps you dry.

In medicine, improvisation is actually the norm. As a clinician, you're never not having to improvise. You're always applying existing knowledge in new contexts – because you're working with people, every situation is different. There's no such thing as a ‘standard' case of pneumonia or a ‘regular' stabbed neck. Each time, you're dealing with a unique human being. Even when you treat the same person for the same complaint on different occasions, it's a different situation each time. You can never step into the same river twice. You and the river have both changed.

How you improvise is key to becoming expert. It's part of your voice, your style, the way you interact with others. It's how people recognize you for the individual expert you are turning into.

随机应变与表现是密不可分的。然而「表现」这个词会让很多人感到不安。对他们来说，「表现」听起来像是在做一件不真实、不真诚的事情 —— 甚至是在伪装。我完全不同意。没有人会批评钢琴家演奏贝多芬的协奏曲，毕竟他们花了很多年的时间学习和练习这些曲目。

表现不仅仅是舞台上的事情。我们说的做手术、操作、做实验，以及演奏协奏曲和表演戏剧都属于表现。无论是音乐家、演员还是舞蹈家，表现就是一切；但对于医学和科学，表现同样重要。在任何表现里，随机应变都是重要的组成部分。

随机应变事关你如何运用所学的知识，在当下提出解决方案，对周围发生的事情做出反应。然而，随机应变的概念，就像表现的概念一样，常会让人感到不安。这听起来很不专业，像是一种突发奇想的解决方案，就像用木板和砖块临时搭成的书架，或者匆忙搭起来的避雨棚一样。但我认为这是一种无价的技能。那个避雨棚也许是临时搭建的，但它能为你遮风挡雨。

在医学工作里，随机应变实际上是一种常态。作为一名医生，你总是不得不随机应变。你总是要在新情境中运用现有的知识 —— 因为你和人一起工作，每种情况都是不同的。不存在所谓「标准」的肺炎病例，或者「常规」的颈部刺伤。每次工作时，你都在与一个独特的人打交道。即使你在不同的场合治疗同一个人、同一种疾病，每一次的情况也会有所不同。你不能两次踏入同一条河流。你和河流都变了。

懂得如何随机应变是成为专家的关键。这是你的「声音」和风格的一部分，属于你与他人互动的方式。有了这种能力，大家才会认识到你正在成为一个与众不同的专家。

### 9.3 随机应变能力挽狂澜

Improvisation as recovery

Every so often a spectacular recovery hits the media. In January 2009, Captain Chesley Sullenberger was piloting US Airways Flight 1549, an Airbus A320 passenger plane. Soon after take-off from LaGuardia Airport in New York, the aeroplane suffered a bird strike from a flock of Canada geese. Both engines failed. In one of the most celebrated emergency landings in aviation history, Sullenberger realized he couldn't reach any nearby airports and decided to ‘ditch' the plane, bringing it down on the Hudson River. Miraculously, everyone on board survived.

Talking about it afterwards, Sullenberger described how he'd dealt with the situation. Once he had made the decision to ditch, he eliminated distractions by shutting off the radio. Then he gave all his attention to bringing the plane down on water. Like all pilots, he had been training throughout his career for low-probability, high-severity events like this. It also turned out that in the phase of doing time, Sullenberger had other relevant experience, including landing seaplanes. Afterwards, he summarized his achievement like this: ‘One way of looking at this might be that, for forty-two years, I've been making small, regular deposits in this bank of experience, education and training. And on January 15, the balance was sufficient so that I could make a very large withdrawal.' Despite his modesty, I think that's a perfect way of putting it.

Sullenberger's forty-two years of experience allowed him to develop a cumulative knowledge he could draw on at very short notice. When the birds struck, he brought into play those years of doing time, using his senses and working with others. He had the experience to frame the problem and decide on the best option, then create the conditions where he could give his undivided attention to bringing the airliner down on the river. He minimized extraneous demands on his attention, then used his full capacity to focus on the task and achieve the best possible chance of success.

But it's not just in aviation that such spectacular recoveries happen. In 1997, the Portuguese pianist Maria João Pires sat down to play a Mozart piano concerto at a lunchtime concert at the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam, conducted by Riccardo Chailly. As the orchestra started the opening bars, Pires realized they were playing a different concerto from the one she had prepared.

In the documentary of this extraordinary event, we see Pires in a state of shock. Chailly looks at her from the rostrum, and she tells him, ‘I had another concerto in my schedule.' First he reassures her: ‘You played this one last season.' Then he smiles and says, ‘I'm sure you can do it – and you can do it well.'

And she does.

She gathers herself together while the orchestra finishes the introduction, then gives a flawless performance of Mozart's D minor masterpiece.

Like the bass player at the beginning of this chapter, Pires was able to improvise a solution to her daunting challenge. She had already internalized the D minor concerto and had played it many times before. But being able to reconfigure that knowledge and bring it into play with less than a minute's notice – in public, when the performance had already started – seems extraordinary. Only an expert could do that.

Being expert is not only about becoming good at your core work. It's about being able to respond to things you've never encountered, and having the confidence to go with the decisions you make. Chailly's support played a crucial role in Pires's ability to respond. Like Sullenberger, she was able to save what could have been a disastrous situation with a combination of quick thinking, experience, and a lifetime's hard work and preparation. Somehow, she was able to push away her fear and rely on the skills she had developed over decades.

Few examples of recovery are as dramatic as Sullenberger's and Pires's, but they often have similar characteristics. When Fabrice the stylist cut his client's hair too short as we saw in Chapter 6 , he had to read her state of mind as he decided how to cope with the situation. Much later in his career, one of his roles was to deal with clients when another stylist had made a mistake. Partly this was because of his technical expertise in putting errors right. Even more important, though, was his ability to establish a rapport with a dissatisfied client and come up with a solution that defused the situation and led to a positive outcome.

In all these examples, skill was necessary but not sufficient. How these experts handled their own response and their relationships with other people was key. Sullenberger had to subdue his anxiety and instil confidence in his team by his comportment, while using his skill to land that huge airliner on a river. Pires had to work with Chailly and the orchestra to create an unforgettable experience for the audience. Fabrice had to put himself in his client's position, addressing her concerns without becoming defensive. All of them wanted to achieve the best possible result under circumstances they couldn't have predicted.

每隔一段时间，媒体就会报道一次力挽狂澜的壮举。2009 年 1 月，机长切斯利·萨伦伯格（Chesley Sullenberger）正在驾驶美国航空公司 1549 航班，这是一架空客 A320 客机。从纽约拉瓜迪亚机场起飞后不久，这架飞机就撞上了一群加拿大雁。两个引擎都出了故障。萨伦伯格意识到他无法到达附近的任何机场，于是决定将飞机迫降在哈德逊河上。此举成了航空史上最著名的紧急迫降之一。机上的每个人都奇迹般地活了下来。事后，萨伦伯格讲述了他是如何处理当时情况的。他决定第 9 章学会随机应变 183

迫降之后，就关掉了无线电以消除干扰。然后他全神贯注地将飞机迫降在了水面上。就像所有飞行员一样，他的整个职业生涯都在训练如何应对这种低概率、高严重性的事件。原来，在积累经验的阶段，萨伦伯格也有过其他的相关经验，包括降落水上飞机。后来，他这样总结自己的成就：「我们可以这样来看待这件事，42 年来，我一直在积累相关的经验、教育与训练，就像在往银行里定期、少量地存钱一样。到了 1 月 15 日那天，余额存够了，我可以取出一大笔钱来。」尽管他很谦虚，但我认为他说得再好不过了。

萨伦伯格 42 年的经验使他积累了大量知识，可供他在短时间内加以利用。与飞鸟相撞时，他利用了多年积累的经验，运用了自己的感官，并很好地与他人合作。他有足够的经验厘清眼前的问题，选择最佳方案，然后创造条件，让自己全神贯注地将客机迫降在河面上。他尽可能地减少了分散他注意力的额外因素，然后竭尽全力地专注于这件事情，争取最大的成功可能性。

这种力挽狂澜的壮举不仅仅会发生在航空领域。1997 年，在阿姆斯特丹音乐厅的午间音乐会上，葡萄牙钢琴家玛 （ Maria Joao Pires）（Riccardo Chailly）的指挥下，坐下来开始演奏一首莫扎特的钢琴协奏曲。在乐队开始演奏前几小节时，皮雷斯意识到他们演奏的不是自己之前准备的那首协奏曲。

在纪录片中，我们可以看到皮雷斯一脸惊愕。夏伊在指挥台上看着她，而她对夏伊说：「我准备的是另一首协奏曲。」夏伊先是安慰她：「你上次演奏过这首曲子。」然后他微笑着说：「我相信你能做到，而且你能做得很好。」

她的确做得很好。

在乐队即将演奏完前奏时，她让自己静下心来，然后完美地演奏了莫扎特的这首 D 小调杰作。

就像本章开头的那个贝斯手一样，皮雷斯能够随机应变，找到应对艰巨挑战的方法。她已经对这首 D 小调协奏曲烂熟于胸了，并且之前已经演奏过很多次了。但是，能够在不到一分钟的时间里回想并运用那些知识似乎是非同寻常的能力 —— 更不用提是在众目睽睽之下，表演已经开始的情况下。

成为专家不仅要擅长你的主要工作，还要能够对你从未遇到过的事情做出反应，对你所做的决定怀有信心。皮雷斯之所以能做出反应，是因为夏伊的支持起到了至关重要的作用。与萨伦伯格一样，她凭借敏捷的思维、丰富的经验，以及一生的努力与准备，挽救了可能发生的灾难。她设法控制住了自己的恐惧，依赖自己几十年来培养的技能。

很少有像萨伦伯格和皮雷斯这样戏剧性地力挽狂澜的例子，但这样的例子通常都有相似的特点。我们在第 6 章看到，当发型设计师法布里斯把他顾客的头发剪得太短的时候，他必须揣摩顾客的心理状态，才能决定如何应对这种情况。很久以后，他在工作中的一项职责就是在其他发型设计师犯错之后与顾客打交道。这在一定程度上是由于他拥有纠正错误的专长。然而，更重要的是，他有能力与不满意的顾客建立融洽的关系，想出解决方案，化解紧张的局面，取得积极的结果。

在所有这些例子里，技能是必要但不足够的。这些专家如何处理他们自己的反应以及他们与其他人的关系才是关键所在。

萨伦伯格必须克服自己的焦虑，通过自己的行为举止让团队充满信心，并利用自己的技能将大型客机迫降在河面上。皮雷斯必须与夏伊和乐队紧密合作，为观众带来一场难以忘怀的体验。

法布里斯必须站在顾客的立场上，考虑她的问题，而不能采取辩解的态度。他们都希望在无法预测的情况下取得最好的结果。

### 9.4 是的，而且…

‘Yes , and …'

So far, I've talked about improvisation in a general sense – as the ability to respond to what's around you and come up with solutions to the challenges you find. In theatre, the word ‘improvisation' has a more specialized meaning.

In 1979, the theatre director Keith Johnstone published Impro , in which he describes his work with groups of actors. For Johnstone, improvisation is a skill that can be studied and practised, underpinned by a cardinal principle: it depends on willingness by all concerned – willingness to listen, willingness to respond, and willingness to work together in a creative rather than a destructive way. If a pair of actors was improvising a sketch, Johnstone would insist that every response should start with ‘Yes, and …', building on the other's move and opening up new possibilities. This is the opposite of the ‘Yes, but …' response, which blocks the next move and shuts down possibilities. Johnstone would ask participants to come with a calm mind, prepared to draw on whatever was inside them for the good of the joint performance.

This is far more difficult than it sounds. We are so used to our internal critic making judgements about what is likely to work – and what isn't – that it can be difficult to let go. But this willingness to accept and respond to what another person offers is central to becoming expert. It's another aspect of ‘it's not about you, it's about them'. It shows respect for the perspectives of other people, whether you're an actor or a doctor.

Up to this point in the path to becoming expert, you've been conforming to the framework you have chosen to work in. Your reference point has been the work as it is already done. You copy others, do things as they do. You remain within a system. But now you are questioning the system and redefining its limits. You are using your individuality to do what you think is best. No longer compelled to stick to how other people do things, the onus is on you to do them in the best way you can.

Sometimes this need to think differently is forced upon you, as when I was operating on Themba and his stabbed neck. I didn't want to move outside the system I'd learned, but at that moment the system wasn't working. I had to do something, and what I'd learned didn't help. When you're out of your depth, you have to think for yourself or something bad will happen.

In the performing arts, improvisation isn't the exclusive province of jazz or theatre. Far from it. Improvisation in classical music was highly prized for centuries. The ability to sway the ear in gentle undulation, to use C. P. E. Bach's words, was all about responding to the moment and adapting your performance accordingly. Now there is a resurgence of interest in this concept. David Dolan, Professor of Classical Improvisation at London's Guildhall School of Music and Drama, explained it to me like this: ‘Until a little over a century ago, all musicians were expected to include improvisational elements in their performances. Every time they played a repeat passage it would be different. Now, they are assessed on how closely they stick to what is written; how "accurately" they play the notes, rhythm and dynamics specified on the page. That squeezes out their ability to improvise.' For Dolan, the true art is to fully internalize the structure of the music you're playing, then use it as a point of departure you return to as you create fresh interpretations of what you already know. It made me think of Bill Evans the jazz pianist, alone in his garage, analysing his technique for month after painstaking month.

There is a world of difference between playing the notes ‘correctly' – that is to say, as written – and playing them as you want them to be heard. As a musician, you are not re-enacting something you've practised and perfected in isolation, but entering a dialogue. A piece of music only comes to life when you go beyond what is written on the page, when you breathe your personality into it as you're playing.

It's the same with any performance. To do it well, you have to understand the underlying structure, the essential architecture of your work. When you perform, you are connecting that structure with your own emotional world and that of your audience. Magicians, for instance, have to deal with the occasional slip of a finger, or cope with an audience member who forgets which card they chose. There's always an element of unpredictability in performance, always the need to bring your skills together in the moment.

Of course, there is a difference between the improvisational flexibility that brings a piece of written music to life during performance, and the improvisation that happens independently of existing repertoire. But in both forms you have to remain alert, to listen attentively to what is happening around you, and always respond with Johnstone's ‘Yes, and …'

Just like playing jazz, being a doctor depends on improvisation, especially if you're a GP. Each encounter with a patient is unique and unpredictable, yet it takes place within a canon of medical knowledge and skill you've spent years acquiring – your equivalent of a trumpet player's scales and techniques. This canon provides a safety net which gives you the freedom to go in unexpected directions. As an inexperienced clinician, you may be reluctant to start a conversation that could lead into areas you don't feel competent to deal with, or to move outside your textbook knowledge. Later on, you develop the confidence to ask different questions, to probe a little, to risk discomfort. If you try to force a consultation to stay within rigid lines, patients will feel frog-marched. You may be responding to what you want the problem to be because you know how to treat it, rather than finding out what that problem actually is. Instead, you have to listen carefully, then take each part of the conversation forward with a ‘Yes, and …' This means taking risks.

Those skills you built up through doing time, becoming familiar with the materiality of your craft, and learning to recognize the nature of thin materials and their imminent collapse – all these have to be present. You can't improvise without them. But you don't have to show them. The more expert the expert, the less you see what they've had to do to get there. As Bill Evans the jazz icon pointed out and we saw in the previous chapter, the danger comes if a learner tries to mimic what an expert does without having gone through those years of graft. In medicine, for example, you can easily mistake the smoothness of an expert's improvised performance for a cosy chat. You might think you could do that too. Very soon, you would find you can't.

到目前为止，我讲的都是一般意义上的随机应变 —— 一种对周围发生的事情做出反应，并设法解决你面临的挑战的能力。

在手术室里，「随机应变」这个词有一种更特殊的含义。

1979 年，戏剧导演基思·约翰斯通（Keith Johnstone）出版了《即兴》（Impro）一书，他在书中讲述了自己与几批演员合

作的经历。对约翰斯通来说，随机应变是一种可以学习和练习的技能，这种技能的基本原则是：它取决于所有相关的意愿 —— 倾听、回应的意愿，以及以创造性而非破坏性的方式合作的意愿。如果两名演员正在即兴创作一个小品，约翰斯通会要求他们每句回应的台词都以「是的，而且……」开头 —— 以对方的表演为基础，开拓新的可能性。这与「是的，但是……」的反应截然相反。这种回答会妨碍接下来的行动，减少可能性。约翰斯通要求参与者保持冷静的头脑，准备运用自己内心的任何感受来合作表演。

这实际上比听起来要难得多。我们内心里有一个批评家，总会评判哪些办法可行 —— 哪些不可行。我们已经习惯于听从这个批评家的声音了，所以很难放下这种先入之见。然而，这种接受与回应他人提议的意愿，对成为专家而言十分重要。这是「重点不在于你，而在于他们」的另一个方面。无论你是演员还是医生，这种行为都体现了对他人观点的尊重。

在成为专家的旅途上，你一直都在遵循你所选择的领域里的工作框架。你一直参考的是已经完成的工作。你模仿他人，按照他们的做法去做事。你一直停留在一个系统里。但你此时在质疑这个系统，重新划定它的边界。你在凭借自己的个性，做出你认为的最佳选择。你不再必须遵循别人的做事方式，你有责任去用最好的方式做事。

有时，这种思维方式的改变是被迫的，就像我在给滕巴被刺伤的脖子动手术时一样。我并不想离开我熟知的系统，但那套系统在当时并不管用。我必须采取行动，而我所学的东西却派不上用场。当你力不从心时，你就必须独立思考，否则糟糕的事情就会发生。

在表演艺术里，即兴表演并不是爵士乐和戏剧的专利。事实远非如此。几个世纪以来，即兴表演在古典音乐里一直受到高度重视。用 C.P.E. 巴赫的话来说，用轻柔、顿挫的乐音打动人耳的能力，完全取决于表演者对当下时刻做出反应并相应地调整自己的表演。现在，人们对这一概念又重新燃起了兴趣。

伦敦市政厅音乐及戏剧学院古典即兴演奏系教授大卫·多兰（David Dolan）这样解释道：「直到一个多世纪以前，大家认为所有音乐家都应该在表演中加入即兴元素。每次他们演奏一段重复的音乐，都会有所不同。现在，对音乐家的评估标准变成了他们对既定乐谱的忠实程度，也就是他们演奏乐谱上特定音符、节奏和力度的‘准确'程度。这样就打压了他们即兴演奏的能力。」在多兰看来，真正的艺术是完全内化你所演奏的音乐结构，然后将其作为一个出发点。在你对你熟知的东西做出新的诠释之后，你会回到这个出发点。这种观点让我想起了爵士乐钢琴家比尔·埃文斯，独自一人待在车库里，连续数月艰苦努力，分析自己的演奏技术。

「正确」地弹奏音符（也就是说，按照乐谱上弹）与弹奏出你想要传达的信息之间有着天壤之别。作为一名音乐家，你不是在重现你独自练习过、完善过的东西，而是在进行一段对话。只有超越乐谱上所写的东西，把自己的个性注入你所演奏的东西，音乐才会具有生命力。

对于任何需要表现的事情来说都是如此。要做好这件事，你就必须理解其底层结构，即工作的基本架构。你在工作的时候，就是在这个结构与你和受众的情感世界之间建立联结。例如，魔术师必须应对手指间的偶然失误、忘记选择了哪张扑克的观众。表演中总有不可预测的因素，总是需要你在当下综合运用各项技能。

当然，在表演中把一段写好的音乐演奏得饱含生命力所需的随机应变的灵活性，与完全独立于既有曲目的即兴创作是有区别的。但在这两种情况下，你都必须保持专注，用心倾听周围发生的事情，并始终以约翰斯通所说的「是的，而且……」的态度做出回应。

就像演奏爵士乐一样，做医生也需要随机应变，尤其是在你是全科医生的情况下。每次接待患者都是独特的、不可预测的经历，但这些经历不会超出你多年来习得的医学知识与技能 —— 相当于小号手对音阶的掌握与演奏技巧。这些标准化的知识和技能提供了一种保障，让你能够自由地朝着意料之外的方向探索。如果你是一个缺乏经验的医生，你就可能不愿意谈及你觉得自己没有能力应对的领域，或者超出课本知识的话题。

后来，你的自信会逐渐增长，你也能够询问不同的问题，稍做探索，承担不舒服的风险。如果你试图把问诊限制在严格的范围之内，患者就会感到你在强迫他。你可能会对你想要的问题做出回应，而不去发现真正的问题是什么，因为你知道如何治疗前者。你不应如此，而是必须仔细倾听，然后用「是的，而且……」来推进对话的每一个部分。这意味着承担风险。

这些技能是你通过积累经验、熟悉工作对象、了解脆弱工作对象的性质以及它何时会濒临崩溃而习得的 —— 你需要完成所有这些步骤。没有这些步骤，你就不能随机应变。但是你不一定要表现出来。专家越是专业，你就越难以看出他们走到现在这一步所付出的努力。正如传奇爵士音乐家比尔·埃文斯所说，也正如我们在上一章所看到的，如果一个学习者试图模仿专家的行为，却没有专家多年的艰苦努力，他就会陷入危险的境地。例如，在医学工作中，你很容易把专家轻松自如的随机应变看作一次愉快的交谈。你可能以为自己也能做到这一点。

很快你就会发现你做不到。

### 9.5 风险工艺

The workmanship of risk

Joshua the tailor is an expert improviser, a master of the unexpected. Soon after he set up as an independent tailor, he took on a customer who didn't know what he wanted. Joshua said something like this: ‘If you let me design and make you a jacket, I can't tell you exactly what it will look like or even how long it will take. But I can tell you it will be the best jacket you've ever had.'

Many people would have felt uneasy at that point, but this client was willing to go with it. Joshua was as good as his word, the jacket was superb and the customer loved it. Part of that contract involved a willingness by both parties to live with uncertainty while the jacket was being made. It's what David Pye was talking about when he contrasted the workmanship of certainty and the workmanship of risk. I have found this a useful distinction, but it needs some explanation.

Pye was a well-known furniture-maker and Professor of Furniture Design at the Royal College of Art in London. In 1968, he published his influential book The Nature and Art of Workmanship . He begins with a definition:

If I must ascribe a meaning to the word craftsmanship, I shall say as a first approximation that it means simply workmanship using any kind of technique or apparatus, in which the quality of the result is not predetermined, but depends on the judgement, dexterity and care which the maker exercises as he works. The essential idea is that the quality of the result is continually at risk during the process of making; and so I shall call this kind of workmanship ‘The workmanship of risk': an uncouth phrase but at least descriptive.

It may be mentioned in passing that in workmanship the care counts for more than the judgement and dexterity; though care may well become habitual and unconscious.

Pye goes on:

With the workmanship of risk we may contrast the workmanship of certainty, always to be found in quantity production, and found in its pure state in full automation. In workmanship of this sort the quality of the result is exactly predetermined before a single saleable thing is made … The most typical and familiar example of the workmanship of risk is writing with a pen, and of the workmanship of certainty, modern printing … in principle the distinction between the two different kinds of workmanship is clear and turns on the question: ‘Is the result predetermined and unalterable once production begins?'

Pye's example from the 1960s may seem odd to modern readers, when handwriting is in decline and printing has become digital. Nevertheless, his point is clear. His emphasis on ‘any kind of technique or apparatus' shows that he is not thinking only of traditional techniques of making, but is looking ahead to new technologies as they emerge. And Pye is not talking of the risk of poor quality. Instead he is talking about inherent uncertainty, the inability to specify in advance exactly what will happen. The risk is to the predictability of the result, not to those using or experiencing it.

All the experts I describe in this book deal in the workmanship of risk. A surgical operation, a bespoke suit, a clinical consultation, a magic show, a stone carving, a musical performance, a hairstyle – the result is not predetermined and unalterable in any of them. They all contain uncertainty.

To the modern reader, the word ‘risk' has other resonances, suggesting the probability of danger to ourselves or others, of financial consequences or threats to public safety. Of course, the two notions of risk overlap, especially when human beings are concerned. When working with people, nothing can ever be certain. Thus Pye highlights judgement, dexterity and care, with care counting for more than the other two.

For all his old-fashioned terminology, Pye's ideas ring true to me – and he crystallizes something crucial. A necessary uncertainty runs through expert work. As you gain experience, you have to accept and deal with that. That's why the ability to improvise, to come up with new solutions, is critical. As a surgeon, I came to realize that all I could know for certain before starting an operation was that there were things I couldn't know in advance. It might be the details of the injury or the presence of an anatomical variation. It might be how that patient's organs and tissues would behave, or how they would hold sutures. It might be how much bleeding I'd encounter, how tissue planes might be stuck down or obliterated because of previous surgery or infection. I couldn't tell beforehand which structures would be thin materials on the verge of collapse.

It was during this not-knowing that I needed the confidence and the skill that would allow me to improvise. I might not be able to tell in advance what I was going to find, but I had to feel I could deal with it.

裁缝约书亚是一个随机应变的专家，一个让人出乎意料的大师。他独立经营裁缝店后不久，就接待了一位不知道自己想要什么的顾客。约书亚是这样说的：「如果你让我给你设计并制作一件西装上衣，我不能准确地告诉你成品是什么样子，甚至不能告诉你需要多长时间。但我能告诉你的是，这将是你拥有过的最棒的西装上衣。」

许多人在这时都会感到不安，但这位客人却愿意接受。约书亚说到做到，那件上衣棒极了，顾客很喜欢。他们的约定要求双方都要容忍西装制作过程中的不确定性。大卫·派伊 （David Pye）在比较确定性工艺（workmanship of certainty）与风险工艺（workmanship of risk）时，讨论的就是这个问题。我觉得区分这两者是很有用的，但这种区分需要一些解释。

派伊是一个著名的家具制造商，也是伦敦皇家艺术学院的家具设计系教授。1968 年，他出版了颇具影响力的著作《工艺的本质与艺术》（ The Nature and Art of Workmanship）。他从一个定义开始讲起：

如果必须说出「技艺」这个词的含义，我认为最接近的意思是，使用任何技术或设备的工艺 —— 这种工艺的成果不能预先确定，而是取决于匠人工作时的判断、灵巧手艺与关心。其基本理念是，在制造的过程中，成果的质量始终面临着风险。所以我将这种工艺称为「风险工艺」。这个用词虽然不太优雅，但至少说清了基本含义。

顺便一提，在工艺中，关心比判断和灵巧的手艺更重要，不过这种关心可能是习惯性的、无意识的。

派伊继续写道：

我们可以把「确定性工艺」与风险工艺进行比较。前者始终存在于批量生产的过程中，尤其是完全自动化的批量生产。在这类工艺中，成果的质量在任何一个可以销售的产品被制造出来之前就完全确定了………

风险工艺最典型、最为人熟知的例子就是用笔写字，而确定性工艺的例子则是现代印刷术…… 从原则上讲，这两种不同的工艺之间有着明确的区别，这种区别在于这个问题：「一旦开始生产，成果是否就已经确定、不容更改了？」

对于现在的读者来说，派伊举的 20 世纪 60 年代的例子可能显得有些奇怪，因为现在手写的东西越来越少，而印刷已经进入了数字化时代。然而，他的观点是明确的。他对「任何技术或设备」的强调表明，他不仅考虑了传统的制造技术，也展望了新生的技术。派伊谈论的不是产品质量低劣的风险。相反，他谈论的是产品内在的不确定性，即无法预先明确将会发生什么。这是成果可预测性上的风险，而不是使用者或体验者要面临的风险。

我在本书中提到的所有专家，都要采用风险工艺。外科手术、定制西装、临床问诊、魔术表演、石雕、音乐表演、发型设计 —— 所有这些工作的成果都不是预先确定的，也不是不可改变的。它们都包含不确定性。

对于现在的读者来说，「风险」这个词还有其他意思，即我们自己或他人面临危险的可能性，或者涉及金融的后果、公共安全的威胁。当然，这两种风险的概念有重叠之处，尤其是涉及人类的时候。和人一起工作时，没有什么是确定的。因此，派伊强调判断、灵巧手艺和关心的重要性，并指出关心远比另两者重要。

虽然派伊使用的术语有些古老，但我赞同他的理念 —— 他阐明了一些至关重要的东西。专家的工作中贯穿着一种必要的不确定性。随着经验的积累，你必须接纳并处理这种不确定性。这就是为什么随机应变、另辟蹊径的能力是至关重要的。做外科医生的时候，我逐渐意识到，在做手术之前，我唯一能够确定的事情是，有些事情我无法预先知道。这些事情可能是伤口的细节，也可能是解剖学上的变异；可能是患者器官与组织的运作方式，也可能是缝合这些器官与组织时可能会遇到的意外；可能是我会遇见的出血量出乎意料，也可能是某些组织平面因为以前的手术或感染而黏住或消失。我无法事先判断哪些组织结构会成为濒临崩溃的脆弱工作对象。

正是在这种未知的情况下，我才需要足够的信心和技能来随机应变。也许我无法提前知道我会发现什么，但我必须相信我能应付得来。

### 9.6 应对不可预测的事情

Responding to the unpredictable

Improvisation and risk go hand in hand. When you try something new, there's always the possibility that it won't work out the way you hoped. In Chapter 6 , we looked at what happens when you get things wrong and have to put them right. In this chapter, we've explored the idea that experts are always improvising, always responding to the unexpected. Now, we'll bring these ideas together to talk about resilience and recovery.

Experts take responsibility for the variation inherent in their work. They read the materials they work with and the people their work is for – their audience, their clients, their patients. Experts adapt their knowhow to each set of circumstances, and reconsider the problem every time. They remain in dialogue with their work and their audience. Dealing with complications goes with the territory, and learning how to cope when things go wrong is one of the marks of becoming expert. Resilience and recovery are essential qualities if you are to continue to develop as an expert.

Sometimes a bowel anastomosis (joining two sections of intestine together after cutting a section out) springs a leak after the operation itself is over. These things happen and it's nobody's fault. In medicine, they are referred to as ‘complications'. They're part of the uncertainty that goes with operating; some patients heal better than others.

This is different from making an error. Complications are things that go wrong even when you have done the right thing. Every surgical operation has a complication rate, and you can give it a number. You might say that the leakage rate after partial gastrectomy (removing part of the stomach) is 5 per cent. If you operate on one hundred patients, five of them will have a leak. When that happens to someone you've operated on, it doesn't necessarily mean you did anything wrong, though it's hard to believe that at the time. It's just one of the realities of working with live human beings.

There are equivalents in every field. If you're a ceramicist, there's an inherent unpredictability about glazing and firing. Sometimes a batch simply doesn't work and you can't figure out why. If you haven't ever had a complication, it usually just means you haven't done enough operations, made enough pots or been working in your field for long enough.

We often think of the tangible things which experts create, like vases, paintings or suits. But, as we've seen, many experts create transient experiences such as music, magic or fine dining. Here, too, there is the workmanship of risk. Here, too, there is uncertainty.

Doing the best job you can means doing things slightly differently each time, responding to the specifics of the moment. Whenever that happens, you have improvised. When Joshua says, ‘This will be the best jacket you have ever had,' he is asking his customer to trust him to come up with a solution for their unique needs, rather than applying a predetermined approach. Joshua's skill, like mine as a GP, lies as much in defining the problem as in knowing how to solve it. This highlights the contrast between a human expert and an algorithm. Some medical procedures, such as diagnosing cervical cancer by identifying abnormal smear cells under the microscope, can be done effectively by mechanized systems. But robots are no good at telling patients that they have cancer or listening to their concerns. Each doctor will approach a diagnosis differently, judging what's best for that patient.Responding to the unpredictable

随机应变总是与风险如影随形。当你尝试新事物时，总会有不如所愿的可能性。在第 6 章中，我们探讨了犯错和必须纠错的情况。在这一章里，我们谈到了专家总是在随机应变，总是应对意料之外的事情。接下来，我们要把这些理念汇集在一起，谈一谈抗逆力与复原力的问题。

专家要为他们工作中固有的变化负责。他们要读懂自己的工作对象，读懂他们工作的受众 —— 他们的观众、客户、患者。

专家会根据不同的情况调整自己的技巧，在不同的场合都会重新思考眼前的问题。他们会一直与自己的作品、与受众对话。

处理错综复杂的意外情况，是专家必须要做的事情，学习处理出错的事情是成为专家的标志之一。如果你要继续成长为一名专家，那么抗逆力与复原力就是必要的素质。

有时肠吻合术（切除一段肠道后将两节肠子缝合在一起）结束后会出现泄漏。这种事有时会发生，不是任何人的错。在医学上，这种现象被称为「并发症」。这是手术的不确定性的一部分，有些患者比其他患者恢复得更好。

这和犯错是不同的。并发症是指，即使你做了正确的事情依然会出现的问题。每种外科手术都有一个并发症发生率，你可以找到确切的数字。你可以说，部分胃切除术（切除部分胃部）后的泄漏率为 5％。如果你给 100 个患者做手术，其中 5 人会有泄漏。如果这种事发生在你的手术患者身上，并不一定意味着你做错了什么，尽管在当时你很难相信这一点。这只是与活人一同工作要面对的现实之一。

每个领域都有类似的事情。如果你是陶艺师，在上釉和烧制的时候就要面对一种固有的不确定性。有时一批产品就是会出问题，而你不知道其中的原因。如果你从没遇到过「并发症」，这通常意味着你做的手术、陶罐不够多，或者在你的领域里工作的时间不够长。

我们经常能想到专家创造的有形的东西，比如花瓶、画作或西装。但我们也看到了，许多专家创造的是短暂的体验，比如音乐、魔术或美食。在这些领域里，也涉及风险工艺，也有不确定性。

尽你所能做到最好，意味着你每次做事都稍有不同，都要对当下的具体情况做出反应。每当这种事情发生时，你都是在随机应变。当约书亚说「这将是你拥有过的最棒的西装上衣」时，他是在请客户相信他能为他们的独特需求制订解决方案，而不是采用某种既定的做法。约书亚的裁缝技艺，与我作为全科医生的技能一样，既在于界定问题，也在于知道如何解决问题。这凸显了人类专家与算法之间的差别。机械化系统可以高效地完成一些医疗流程，如在显微镜下发现异常的涂片细胞以诊断宫颈癌。但是，机器人不擅长告诉患者他们得了癌症，也不擅长倾听他们的担忧。每个医生都会用不同的方式处理诊断结果，判断怎么做对患者最有利。

### 9.7 学会什么都不做

Learning to sit on your hands

A lot of published research compares surgery to aviation, exploring how cockpit drills can make surgical procedures safer. By introducing systems from the flight deck, the argument goes, it should be possible to eliminate errors like putting in a heart valve the wrong way round. But now that flying is so safe, most civil aviation has become routine and uneventful. On long-haul international flights, very little happens for much of the time. Of course, there is still extensive training for every conceivable contingency. As we saw when Captain Chesley Sullenberger had to bring his airliner down on the Hudson River, every so often a major disaster occurs – or is narrowly avoided. But these are rare exceptions. Military aviation is a different story.

Phil Bayman is a combat pilot. With over 4,500 flying hours in his logbook, he has seen pretty much everything. Not only has he flown countless missions, but he also trains other pilots. Many of the Red Arrows (the crack UK aerobatic team) are his former students.

Phil and his colleagues have been through all the steps in this book. By the time a combat pilot starts going out on operational sorties, only 15 per cent of their attentional capacity is taken up by flying the plane. The remaining 85 per cent is ‘mission management', assessing and responding to each situation and making split-second decisions. When you think that Hawks and Tornadoes fly at near-supersonic speeds, you begin to realize what these pilots face. As Phil puts it, ‘You are at the limits of your capability.'

Combat flying makes extraordinary demands. In addition to external threats like enemy aircraft, missiles and the challenges of terrain and weather, there are physiological hazards such as G-forces. Phil explained it to me like this: ‘Combat flying is a big game of chess and there are many, many variables. If something starts to go wrong – with your plane, your body or your team – you have to decide which is the biggest crocodile trying to clamber into your boat, and deal with that first.' To do so, you need to keep your wits about you, to respond to what's happening around and within you – in other words, to improvise.

Improvising is a skill you can learn. Phil has a mantra for the pilots he teaches: ‘When things go wrong – sit on your hands and count to ten. There's very little that can't wait for a short time. There are bigger dangers in acting too soon, in committing yourself to a line of action you haven't thought through.' Despite the obvious differences between piloting a fighter jet in a dogfight at the speed of sound and leading a surgical operation, his approach makes perfect sense to me as a clinician.

As a trauma surgeon, you have to decide which are the biggest crocodiles trying to clamber into your boat. When you're faced with torrential bleeding, your first impulse is to put a clamp on something. But in that pool of blood you might clamp the wrong thing and make matters worse. Surgical textbooks describe techniques for gaining control, for recognizing where the blood is coming from, for repairing arteries and veins. They say much less about your internal state – about what it feels like to be on the front line during an operation. It's not just the bleeding, it's how you respond that determines the outcome. Experienced surgeons have learned to gain temporary control of a situation before making irrevocable decisions. They might put in gauze packs and press hard, controlling the bleeding for long enough to step back, think through the options and decide on a strategy. Figuratively speaking, they, too, sit on their hands and count to ten.

Surgery has its G-force equivalents. Tiredness is one of them. During my training it took me a long time to recognize that my decision-making towards the end of a weekend on call, sleep-deprived after working for forty-eight hours non-stop, was questionable to say the least. Gradually I began to understand the signs. I would start to slow down, become indecisive, giggle inappropriately, and become unable to process multiple sources of information. Like pilots experiencing severe G-forces, these manifestations of fatigue are insidious. They creep up without you noticing.

In the operating theatre that evening with Themba, I was lucky. It was early in the intake and I was fully alert. In that welter of blood, I pulled myself together and tried to be methodical, identifying landmarks so I could orient myself and work out what had been injured. My assistant dabbed gently with a swab and suddenly a jet of blood spurted out. Pulsatile, so it must be arterial. Sister Mbata handed me a gauze pack; I fed it into the wound and got my assistant to press hard while I gathered myself and tried to think logically. At least I'd stabilized things for long enough to fight my panic and consider my options. I'd reached a place of temporary safety where I could pause and reset. Knowing how to find that place of safety was crucial.

许多已发表的研究将外科与航空进行了比较，探讨了驾驶舱内的规章制度如何使外科手术更加安全。这种观点认为，引入驾驶舱内的制度到手术室应该能够消除一些错误，例如把心脏瓣膜的方向装反。但是，现在的飞行已经很安全了，大多数民用航空已经变成了平安无事的例行事务。在长途国际航班上，大部分时间里很少有事发生。当然，针对每一种可能的突发事件，仍会有大量的培训。正如切斯利·萨伦伯格机长不得不把飞机迫降在哈德逊河上这件事，重大灾难偶尔也会发生 —— 或者侥幸避免，但这些都是罕见的例外。军事航空则是另外一回事。

菲尔·贝曼（Phil Bayman）是一名战斗机飞行员。他的飞行日志上有超过 4500 小时的飞行时间，他差不多什么都见过。他不仅执行过无数次飞行任务，还训练过其他飞行员。许多「红箭」（英国一流的特技飞行表演队）队员以前都是他的学生。

菲尔和他的同事经历过本书讲述的所有步骤。战斗机飞行员在执行作战任务时，只有 15％的注意力放在驾驶飞机上。余下的 85％ 则用于「任务管理」，评估每一种情况并做出反应，他们要在瞬间做出决定。想一想「鹰」式、「狂风」式战斗机以接近超音速飞行的样子，你就能意识到飞行员面对的是什么情况。

就像菲尔所说：「你已经到了你能力的极限。」

战斗机飞行的要求很高。除了敌机、导弹这样的外部威胁，以及地形、天气这样的挑战以外，还有诸如重力这样的生理危险。菲尔是这样向我解释的：「战斗机飞行像一盘大棋，里面有很多很多变量。如果出现了问题 —— 比如你的飞机、身体、团队出了问题，这些问题就像试图爬到船上的鳄鱼，而你必须判断哪条鳄鱼个头最大，然后优先处理它。」要做到这一点，你就必须保持头脑冷静、对外界和内在发生的事情做出反应 —— 也就是说，随机应变。

随机应变是一种可以学习的技能。对他教过的飞行员，菲尔常说一句话：「事情出错的时候，什么都不要做，先数到十。很少有事不能等上片刻。在没想清楚的情况下草率行动，会有更大的危险。」尽管以音速驾驶战斗机进行空战与带领外科手术团队有明显的区别，但作为一名医生，菲尔的方法在我看来很有道理。

作为创伤外科医生，你必须判断哪条试图爬到船上的鳄鱼最大。当你遇到大出血时，你的第一反应是用止血钳夹住什么东西。但是在那些血肉模糊的组织里，你可能会夹住不该夹的东西，让问题变得更糟糕。外科教科书讲述了控制局面、识别出血位置、修复动脉与静脉的技术。这些教材很少提到你的内心状态 —— 亲手做手术的感觉。不仅是出血决定了手术的结果，还有你的反应。经验丰富的外科医生学会了在做出不可挽回的决定之前暂时控制住局面。他们可能会用力按压纱布包，控制出血，争取足够的时间，以便后退一步，仔细考虑各种选项，并选择一种策略。形象地说，他们也会什么都不做，先数到十。

战斗机驾驶员会受重力的影响，外科手术中也有类似的不利因素。疲劳就是其中之一。在我实习的过程中，我花了很长时间才意识到，在周末值班即将结束的时候，在连续工作 48 个小时、睡眠不足的情况下，我的决策能力至少可以说是有问题的。我逐渐了解了这些迹象。我会开始变得迟钝、犹豫不决、不合适地傻笑，并且无法加工多个来源的信息。就像受到重力严重影响的飞行员一样，疲劳的这些表现是暗藏的。它们会在不知不觉间影响你。

那晚和滕巴一起在手术室里的时候，我很幸运。滕巴入院得早，我非常清醒。在那摊血泊之中，我振作精神，努力做到细致周全，辨认各种参照点，以便弄清各种组织结构的位置，找到受伤的部位。我的助手用棉签轻轻擦拭，突然一股血喷了出来。血流是搏动的，所以一定是动脉出血。姆巴塔护士递给我一个纱布包，我把它塞进伤口里，让助手用力按压，好让我冷静下来，试着用逻辑思考。至少我让滕巴的伤情稳定了足够长的时间，以便克服我的恐惧，考虑我的选项。我有了一种暂时的安全感，能够暂停下来、重整旗鼓。知道如何找到那种安全感是至关重要的。

### 9.8 找到你的安全感

Finding your place of safety

Why is sitting on your hands important? And what does it have to do with improvisation? Improvisation requires you to notice cues and respond to them. When you're dealing with an emergency, or when you're tired or stressed out, your attention narrows to a single point. Having a method to reach a place of safety, kicking the biggest crocodile out of your boat, allows you to experiment and improvise a more permanent solution – to sail somewhere where there aren't any crocodiles.

Long after my experience with Themba, I invited a group of experts to spend a day discussing error and recovery. Phil Bayman the combat pilot was one of them. He set the scene by telling us about an occasion when something felt wrong as he was coming in to land, though he didn't know what. He'd gone through all the steps of his pre-landing checklist, but he still had a sense that something felt odd. Instead of trying to analyse the problem, he aborted his landing, put on full power and climbed to a safe altitude. Once he had time to think, he realized that, despite going through his checklist, he hadn't actually pulled the lever that activated the undercarriage. He had said the words, but he hadn't done the action, just like my student doctor who had gone through the motions of taking somebody's pulse without actually counting it. Unlike the student, though, Phil the expert recognized when something was wrong. In that moment, he only had seconds to react; if he'd stopped to analyse the situation, he'd have crashed and died. By responding instinctively and climbing to a place of safety, he bought himself time. Only when things were more stable did he replay the last few minutes in his mind and identify the problem.

Though the experts in this book work in very different fields, they have all developed a feeling for what the embroiderer Fleur Oakes refers to as ‘wrongness', a special sense that puts them on high alert. When that occurs they do something about it, often so fast that they hardly know what's happened. They have developed systems which stabilize the situation, then give them time to analyse the problem and work out what to do – allowing them to sit on their hands and count to ten. That's how they can switch from forward-thinking reasoning, where they just do what works, to backward-thinking reasoning about the cause.

Not all problems happen with the intensity of combat flying, of course. Earlier in his career, Joshua sometimes had trouble with fitting a sleeve to a jacket. Usually this went smoothly, but sometimes he would realize that things were not going according to plan. The sleeve didn't seem to fit and everything became a struggle. At first he would fiddle with the fabric, but that only made things worse and he would feel his hands tensing up. Eventually he learned to use that tenseness as a signal that it was time to put the work aside and think differently. He would stop sewing and make a cup of tea. That was his place of safety. When he came back, the problem looked different. Once the situation was stabilized, he could think back to those fundamental principles of construction his teacher had taught him. That allowed him to analyse the problem, bring his backward-thinking reasoning into play and then improvise. But first he had to pause, reset and consider.

One of my surgical consultants said almost the same thing when I was starting my training at Baragwanath. ‘If the shit hits the fan and you don't know what to do,' she told me, ‘start by doing nothing. Call for some gauze packs, get your assistant to press hard, then go and have a cup of tea. By the time you come back and re-scrub, things will look different.' I didn't believe her at first, but in that operating theatre with Themba, her words came back to me.

In one sense, the challenges I've just described could hardly be more different. Nobody dies if you play a wrong note or bungle a sleeve, whereas you could easily be wiped out in a fighter aircraft or severely damage a patient on the operating table. But the principle of recognizing that something isn't right, going to a place of safety and thinking what to do next is a characteristic of the expert improviser.

When novices narrow their focus, experts widen theirs. They respond to the situation as a whole, not to isolated elements. Sometimes a completely different solution pops into their mind. Sometimes they experience serendipity.

为什么什么都不做很重要？这和随机应变又有什么关系？

随机应变需要你注意各种线索并做出反应。当你在处理紧急情况时，或者感到疲劳或压力过大时，你的注意力就会缩小到一个点上。设法找到安全感，把最大的鳄鱼从船上踹下去，可以让你尝试并找出更长远的解决方案 —— 把船开到没有鳄鱼的地方去。

在给滕巴做手术的很久以后，我请了一批专家，花了一天时间讨论错误与纠错。战斗机飞行员菲尔·贝曼就是其中之一。他首先给我们讲了一个故事。有一次在降落的时候，他感觉有些不对劲，但自己也不知道为什么。他检查完了降落前的各项步骤，但他还是感觉有些不对劲。他没有试图分析问题，而是放弃了降落，开足马力，爬升到了安全的高度。有时间思考之后，他意识到，尽管他按照各项步骤做了检查，但他没有拉起起落架的控制杆。他只在口头做了检查，但没有付诸行动，就像我监考时看到的那个医学生，他摸了患者的脉搏，却没有真的去数。不过，与那个学生不同的是，菲尔是专家，能够觉察问题。在那一刻，他只有几秒钟的反应时间。如果他停下来分析当时的情况，他就会坠机而死。通过本能的反应，爬升到安全的高度，他为自己争取了时间。在情况稳定下来之后，他才会在脑海中回想刚才几分钟内发生的事情，找出问题所在。尽管本书中的专家所从事的领域各不相同，但他们都有一种如刺绣师弗勒尔·奥克斯所说的「错误意识」，一种让他们高度警惕的特殊感觉。一旦有了这种感觉，他们就会采取相应的行动，这个过程通常很快，以至于他们几乎不知道发生了什么。他们逐渐掌握了一种稳定局面的系统方法，能为他们争取分析问题、找出解决办法的时间 —— 让他们什么都不做，数到十。正是通过这种方式，他们才能从预见性思维模式（做行之有效的事情）转变到回溯性思维模式，寻找问题的原因。

当然，并非只有在驾驶战斗机的紧张情况下才会出现问题。在职业生涯早期，裁缝约书亚有时很难把袖子缝到西装上衣上。通常情况下，一切都很顺利，但有时他会发现事情并不如他所想的那样。袖子似乎并不贴合上衣，一切都变得非常困难。一开始，他会反复调整布料，但这只会让事情变得更糟，他的双手会变得僵硬起来。后来，他学会了把这种僵硬感当作一个信号：是时候把工作放在一旁，换一种思考方式了。他会放下针线活，泡杯茶。这是他寻找安全感的方式。等他回到工作中的时候，问题看上去就不一样了。一旦情况稳定下来，他就能回想起老师教给他的那些基本制衣原则。这样他就能分析问题，运用回溯性思维，随机应变。但首先他必须暂停下来，重整旗鼓，思考眼前的问题。

当我开始在巴拉瓜纳医院实习的时候，有一位外科顾问医师说过一句几乎相同的话：「要是你遇上了大麻烦，不知道该怎么做，」她说，「先什么都别做。要一些纱布包，让助手用力压住，然后你去喝杯茶。等你回来重新擦洗的时候，事情就会不一样了。」起初我不相信她，但是给滕巴做手术的时候，她的话又出现在了我的脑海里。

从某种意义上说，我刚才描述的几种挑战是完全不同的。弹错一个音符、缝坏一只袖子，没有人会死，但你在战斗机上很可能会被消灭，在手术台上也可能严重伤害一位患者。但是意识到情况不对劲、找到安全感、思考下一步该怎么做的原则，是专家级随机应变者的共同特点。

当新手缩小关注点时，专家会扩大自己的关注点。他们会对整体情况做出反应，而不只是应对孤立的因素。有时他们会想到一个完全不同的解决方案。有时他们会有意外的收获。

### 9.9 转祸为福

Turning wrong into right

Katharine Coleman is a glass engraver, widely known for her exquisite work with coloured glass. She depends on expert glassblowers to create the materials she works with. One day, Katharine collected a heavy bowl she was going to engrave as a commission. She was shocked to notice that there were ash marks in the glass. Horrified, she complained to the glassblower. He looked at her pityingly, then reassured her that the marks were just on the surface and everything would be fine. Just polish it, he told her, and the marks would disappear.

Katharine didn't believe him. She couldn't see or feel anything on the surface, and she was convinced that the glass itself was faulty. Back in her studio she examined the bowl again, even more sure that ash from the making process had been embedded in it. But she had no alternative, so she polished it anyway. To her astonishment, within a few seconds all the marks had vanished. Just as the glassblower had told her, the ash had been on the surface all along, and it was the optical properties of the curved bowl that made it look internal.

Katharine's first feeling was overwhelming relief. But with a flash of insight, she realized she had stumbled on something that could revolutionize her practice. Anything you do on the outer surface of a thick-walled piece of curved glass looks different once it's been refracted by the transparent material and reflected onto its inner surface. Though glassblowers have known this since time immemorial, it needed someone like Katharine to exploit the phenomenon for engraving. Now, working to Katharine's specification, the glassblower covers a thick-walled transparent bowl with a thin skin of coloured glass, like the peel of an apple or a potato. Katharine uses this like a canvas for incising her designs, allowing her to develop the creations she is now widely known for.

Katharine told me she could easily have focused on being angry that the glass she had ordered had gone wrong (as she thought). But instead she reframed that experience as an opportunity. From this point of view, error, variation and unpredictability are not to be eliminated. They are to be embraced, because they spur creativity – if you have the imagination to see it like that. That sort of imagination is a form of improvisation, of recognizing the potential within an unexpected situation. Like Keith Johnstone and his actors, Katharine was responding with ‘Yes, and …'

凯瑟琳·科尔曼（Katharine Coleman）是一名玻璃雕花师，以其精美的彩色玻璃作品而闻名。她依靠专业的玻璃吹制工来为她制作她所使用的材料。一天，凯瑟琳去取一只很重的碗，她受托为这只碗雕花。她震惊地发现玻璃上有灰烬的痕迹。

她吓坏了，向玻璃吹制工抱怨。玻璃吹制工同情地看着她，安慰她说痕迹只是在表面上，一切都会好起来的。他对她说，只要继续打磨，这些痕迹就会消失。

凯瑟琳不相信他。她在玻璃的表面上看不到也摸不着任何痕迹，她确信玻璃本身有问题。回到工作室里，她再次检查了这只碗，更加确定是制作过程中留下的灰烬嵌在了玻璃里。可她别无选择，于是还是开始打磨这只碗。令她惊讶的是，几秒钟内，所有的痕迹都消失了。正如玻璃吹制工告诉她的那样，灰烬一直都在玻璃表面，是碗的光学特性使灰烬看上去像是在内部。

凯瑟琳的第一感觉是彻底的解脱。然而她产生了一个顿悟，她意识到自己在无意中发现了一些可能彻底改变她工作方式的东西。你在厚壁曲面玻璃外表面上做的任何加工，一旦经过透明材料的折射，再反射到其内表面，就会看上去不一样。虽然玻璃吹制工自古以来就知道这一点，但只有凯瑟琳这样的人才能利用这一现象进行雕花。现在，按照凯瑟琳的要求，玻璃吹制工会在厚壁透明玻璃碗上覆盖一层薄薄的有色玻璃，就像一层苹果皮或土豆皮一样。凯瑟琳把这层有色玻璃当作「画布」来雕刻她设计的图样，使她能够制作出现在广为人知的作品。

凯瑟琳告诉我，她当时很有可能只顾生气，认定她定制的玻璃出了问题（就像她想的一样）。但是她把这次经历变成了一个机会。从这个角度来看，错误、变化和不可预测性都不是应该被完全消除的东西。我们应该拥抱它们，因为它们会催生创意 —— 如果你有这样看待它们的想象力的话。这种想象力是一种随机应变，是在意想不到的情况下发现可能性。就像基思·约翰斯通和他的演员一样，凯瑟琳是在用「是的，而且……」的态度做出反应。

### 9.10 在压力下随机应变

Improvising under pressure

In the operating theatre at Bara with Themba, I'm fighting a rising sense of panic. My assistant suppresses the bleeding with a gauze pack, and I have time to get some distance. I walk round the operating theatre, trying to calm down and think. Back at the table, I remove the pack and discover that the knife wound has gone through a branch of Themba's carotid artery. I clip and tie it, hoping that will solve the problem. It doesn't, and blood continues to spurt. It's coming from the back of his neck and I realize it must be the vertebral artery. This is a nightmare scenario. As its name suggests, the artery runs through a bony channel formed by the cervical vertebrae. This makes it almost inaccessible. Arteries are elastic, and if one has been severed, its cut ends retract. If that happens inside a place where you can't reach it, such as that bony channel in the neck, the blood will keep pumping and the patient may bleed to death in front of you. I've already seen that happen more than once.

With Themba, nobody else is available to help. Even if I call my consultant in from home it will be at least forty-five minutes before she arrives, and by then it may be too late. It's up to me to do something, and do it now. I'm scared stiff, I'm not yet an expert and I'm seriously out of my depth. But I have to put that to one side. Now I really have to improvise. I try to think as widely as I can. I need inspiration.

Suddenly I have a brainwave. From somewhere – maybe a coffee-room conversation, or an operative surgery book, a journal or just someone's anecdote – I remember a story about using the balloon of a Foley catheter to control this kind of bleeding. Foley catheters are usually used for draining urine. You feed one along a patient's urethra until the catheter's tip is in the bladder. Then you use a syringe to inflate a tiny balloon that stops the catheter slipping out again. The idea with a vertebral artery injury is that the bony channel is so narrow that even a small balloon will apply enough pressure to stop the artery spurting blood. This ‘tamponade', as it's called, can be a lifesaver. At least, that's the theory. It's worth a try. I've got to do something, as Themba's in danger of bleeding out.

I take a deep breath and ask for a paediatric Foley catheter. Sister Mbata looks at me as if I've gone loopy – we're operating on an adult's neck, not a child's pelvis. But she gets me one anyway. Although she has no idea what I'm trying to do, she responds to my weird request with a ‘Yes, and …' We are improvising together.

I feed the catheter into the depths of Themba's wound. Every time I move the gauze swab, the field fills up with blood. Finally, I manoeuvre the catheter's tip into position, inflate the balloon and cross my fingers. Mercifully the bleeding stops and Themba's blood pressure stabilizes. Things are under control at last, and I can take my time. It's still difficult, but finally I get a clip on the artery and stop the blood flooding out. Things are more straightforward from then on and I go back to the techniques I've learned from books. An hour or so later it's almost over, and I'm closing the skin. Themba's lost a lot of blood and he needs to go to the intensive care unit, but he's young and fit. He makes a good recovery, and soon he's able to go back to the general ward. Not long after that, he's well enough to go home. But it was a close call.

My experience that night in the operating theatre with Themba turned out to be a watershed. Watching him leave hospital a few days after I feared he'd die on the operating table showed me yet again that not everything I needed to know was in the books. It gave me the confidence that I could find a solution when I needed to. Decades later, my heart still races when I think back to that operation. At the time I was just thankful to have got away with it, to have come up with a trick that worked. But now I think of it as improvisation, of drawing on information that was floating around somewhere in my mind – finding it when I needed it most. At last, I was beginning to become expert.

The ability to improvise is characteristic of any expert. It's how people bring together the skills and insights they've been developing for years and apply them to each new situation they encounter. Like the bass player in the jazz trio earlier in this chapter, you're able to solve a problem you couldn't have anticipated. Sometimes, this capacity to think round corners can even take your work in a new direction. That's what the next chapter is about.

在巴拉瓜纳医院给滕巴做手术的时候，我正在与越来越强烈的恐慌感作斗争。我的助手用纱布包按压出血的位置，我还有时间后退一步。我在手术室里来回踱步，试图冷静下来思考。

回到手术台旁，我取下纱布包，发现刀伤穿透了滕巴颈动脉的一个分支。我用止血钳夹住这个分支血管，打了个结，希望这样能解决问题。但是问题没有解决，血液还是喷涌而出。血是从他脖子后部来的，我意识到一定是椎动脉出血了。这是噩梦一般的情况。顾名思义，椎动脉就是那条穿过颈椎构成的骨通道的动脉。因此这条动脉几乎是够不着的。动脉是有弹性的，如果动脉被切断，切口处的血管就会收缩。如果这种情况发生在够不着的地方，比如脖子内部的骨通道里，血液就会一直喷涌而出，患者就会在你面前失血过多而死。这种事我已经见过不止一次了。

在给滕巴做手术的时候，没有人能帮上忙。即使我把顾问医师从家里叫来，她也至少需要 45 分钟才能赶到，那时可能就太晚了。只能由我来采取行动，而且必须立刻行动。我吓坏了，我还不是专家，而且这件事大大超出了我的能力范围。我必须把这种感觉放在一边。现在我真的得随机应变了。我试着尽可能地拓宽思路。我需要灵感。

我突然灵机一动。我不知从哪里（也许是咖啡馆里的对话，或是一本外科手术专著、期刊，或者某人的逸事）想起一个用导尿管的气囊来控制这种出血的故事。导尿管通常用于排尿。你要沿着患者的尿道插入导尿管，直到尖端进入膀胱。然后用注射器给一个小气囊充气，防止导尿管滑出。如何将导尿管用于椎动脉损伤呢？我的想法是，椎动脉的骨通道非常狭窄，即便是一个小气囊也能施加足够的压力，阻止动脉喷出血液。这个小气囊叫作「填塞物」，可能救人一命。至少在理论上如此。这值得一试。我必须采取行动，因为滕巴就要失血过多了。

我深吸一口气，要了一根儿科的导尿管。姆巴塔护士看着我，好像我发疯了一样 —— 我们在给成年人的脖子动手术，而不是孩子的骨盆。但她还是给我找来了一根。虽然她不知道我想做什么，但她用「是的，而且……」的态度回应了我奇怪的要求，我们在一同随机应变。

我把导尿管插入了滕巴的伤口深处。每当我移开纱布片，伤口就会溢满血液。最后，我谨慎地将导尿管的尖端送到了正确的位置，给气囊充气，然后默默祈求好运。幸运的是，出血停止了，滕巴的血压稳定下来了。局面终于被控制住了，我可以慢下来了。手术依然很困难，但最后我还是用止血钳夹住了动脉，血液不再喷涌而出了。之后的事情就变得更简单了，我又用上了从书本里学到的技巧。一个多小时后，手术即将结束，我开始缝合皮肤。滕巴流了很多血，需要去重症监护室，不过他还年轻，身强力壮。他恢复得很好，很快就回到普通病房了。不久之后，他就恢复得可以回家了。不过这次手术真是千钧一发。

事实证明，那天晚上在手术室里给滕巴动手术的经历是一个分水岭。看着他离开医院，想到几天之前我还在担心他会死在手术台上，我再次意识到，我需要知道的一切并非都在书本里。这给了我信心，让我在需要的时候能够找到解决办法。

十年后，当我再回想起那次手术时，我的心依然怦怦直跳。当时我很庆幸自己能侥幸成功，想出了一个有效的办法。但我现在认为那是一种随机应变，利用了我脑海中的零散信息 —— 在我最需要的时候找到了这些信息。终于，我开始成为专家了。

随机应变的能力是任何专家的特征。随机应变是我们将多年来积累的技能与领悟融会贯通，运用于我们遇到的每一种新情况中的方式。就像本章前面提到的爵士乐三重奏中的贝斯手一样，你能够解决意想不到的问题。有时候，这种灵活思维的能力甚至能把你的工作带向新的方向。这就是下一章的主题。
