## 0301. 积累

0301 Doing time

It's a Sunday in Manchester Royal Infirmary in 1974 and I've been sent to do ‘the bloods'. For the whole morning I go from patient to patient, taking blood for routine preoperative tests. Nobody else wants to do this job, which is why I've been given it. It's the first time I've been in hospital as a medical student, and I'm feeling excited. Proudly wearing my new white coat, I've crammed my pockets with specimen tubes, syringes, needles and a wad of request forms. A harassed houseman (as newly qualified doctors were called at that time) showed me once what to do, then vanished, leaving me to face the ward on my own.

By now I'm halfway through my time at medical school. For three years I've been learning facts. I've spent hours in the dissecting room, memorizing anatomy. I've spent hours in the histology lab too, looking at slides under the microscope. I've learned about physiology, pharmacology and pathology. But I've never touched a patient.

My first two bloods are easy – patients with large juicy veins which are straightforward to puncture. My confidence blossoms, but not for long. It turns out I've had beginner's luck. Once reality kicks in, I discover that taking blood can be incredibly difficult. Some patients seem to have no veins at all, or thick hard ones like clay pipe stems, or deceptive ones that look easy but burst into huge bruises at the touch of a needle. Often I cause my patients pain as I try again and again. Although they're very understanding, I feel dreadful.

Even managing the kit is a challenge. I need at least four hands to hold the syringes, needles, tourniquets, sticking plasters and swabs. In spite of all the facts I've learned, when it comes to doing, I'm all thumbs. Just as bad are the triplicate forms, and the specimen tubes with tiny shiny labels which my biro won't write on properly. Yet unless I'm meticulous, the forms and tubes can get muddled up. That could be disastrous.

Quite apart from the physical skills of blood-taking, I have to develop ways of keeping track, ensuring I can put my hand on things when I need them. Nobody told me about that part. I've had to create a system for myself. It's tough, but gradually I get the hang of it, and after a few more Sundays I feel a lot more confident. A couple of months later, that new confidence takes another hit.

I've been sent to insert a cannula (‘put up a drip', as it's often called) in a patient who's been admitted on the emergency ‘take'. His blood pressure is low, the houseman is busy and I've been told to set up an intravenous infusion. I've seen it done, and it looked straightforward enough. After all, I've learned how to take blood now, so I should be able to put a cannula into a patient's vein. Then reality kicks in. Faced with a sick patient, a bag of sterile saline and yards of plastic tubing, I have no idea what to do. I'm back to square one.

1974 年的一个星期天，在曼彻斯特皇家医院，我被派去采血。整个上午，我在一个又一个患者之间忙个不停，为常规术前检查采血。没人愿意做这份工作，所以才派我来做。这是我作为医学生第一次到医院见习，我感到很兴奋。我自豪地穿着我的新白大褂，口袋里塞满了采样管、注射器、针头和一叠申请表。一个不胜其烦的实习医生（当时刚取得医师资格的医生被称为实习医生）给我示范了一遍该怎么做，然后就消失了，留下我一个人面对整个住院区。

那时我在医学院的求学生涯刚刚过去一半。三年来我一直在学习知识。我在解剖室里花了很多个小时，记忆解剖学知识。我也在组织学实验室里待过很多个小时，用显微镜观察玻片。我学过生理学、药理学和病理学。但是我从未接触过患者。

前两管血抽得很容易 —— 这两个患者的血管又粗又大，很容易刺穿。我信心满满，但很快就泄了气。事实证明，这只是初学者的运气而已。事实很快让我意识到，采血可能非常困难。有些患者似乎根本没有血管，有些患者的血管就像陶土烟杆一样又粗又硬，还有些人的血管很有欺骗性，看似简单，但针一下去就会出现大片淤青。我一次又一次地尝试，常常会给患者带来痛苦。虽然他们很善解人意，但我感觉很糟糕。

即便对我来说应对工具箱也是一项挑战。我至少需要四只手才能拿下注射器、针头、止血带、胶布和棉签。尽管我学了这么多知识，但在做事情的时候，我还是笨手笨脚的。一式三份的表格和贴着闪亮小标签的采样管也很难对付，我的圆珠笔没法正常地写出字来。如果我不小心，表格和采样管就会被弄混。那可就太糟糕了。

除了采血的身体技能以外，我还需要设法记住所有东西在哪儿，确保我在需要的时候能拿到。从没有人告诉过我这件事。

我必须自己想出一套管理办法。这很难，但我逐渐掌握了窍门，在几个周日之后，我觉得更有信心了。几个月后，我刚刚建立起的信心再次受到了打击。

我被派去给一个急诊患者插套管（俗称「打点滴」）。他的血压很低，实习医生正在忙碌，有人让我去准备静脉输液。我看别人做过这件事，看起来很简单。毕竟，我现在已经学会采血了，把套管插入患者的血管应该也不是问题。然后事实给我泼了一盆冷水。面对一个患者、一袋无菌生理盐水和几米长的塑料管，我完全无从下手。我又回到了原点。

### 3.1 重复劳动的价值

The value of repetitive work

If you've struggled to get the hang of something new, you'll be familiar with this frustration. It goes with the territory of being an Apprentice. Joshua the tailor experienced something similar when he started learning to be a jacket-maker. At that stage he wasn't designing three-piece suits, any more than I was performing operations. He was in a workshop in the house of his master, Ron, making pocket flaps. He made hundreds of them, and they drove him round the bend.

Pocket flaps aren't as simple as they sound. They have to be cut with great precision so they fit the subtle curve of a jacket and don't gape when it moves. They have to be sewn with accuracy and they must look perfect. But making them is repetitive and tedious. Ron had an exacting nature and insisted on the highest standards in his workshop, but he wasn't a natural teacher. Every so often he would look at Joshua's work, then shake his head and say, ‘No.' No explanation, just ‘No'. He wasn't satisfied, but he never said why. So Joshua had to keep on making more pocket flaps. He almost went out of his mind with boredom.

Sometimes, like me with the bloods, Joshua would have beginner's luck. He'd make a pocket flap that Ron was happy with. But that was just a fluke, and Joshua couldn't recreate it. For a long time, he couldn't tell how he was doing. But gradually he began to recognize when his own workmanship was good and when it was still flawed. All that repetition meant that Joshua became able to set the standards for his work and develop consistency. At last Ron was satisfied and allowed him to move on to other tasks, though to this day, when Joshua thinks of pocket flaps he thinks of boring repetitive tasks of no apparent value. Yet, as we'll see, the pocket flaps of this world do have value. Without that experience, Joshua would never have become the master tailor he is today. Likewise, without doing the bloods, I'd never have become a surgeon. There's an equivalent in every field.

Of course, it wasn't just pocket flaps. All through those years as an apprentice, Joshua was doing many kinds of repetitive work. After pocket flaps came making buttonholes, stitching edges, ‘felling' linings, inserting padding and shaping lapels. Later he was entrusted with more difficult tasks, like putting in sleeves, collars and under-canvas. But each task required repetition, and it soon became tedious.

I went through something similar as my career developed. Being a medical student was frustrating enough, but once I qualified things got a lot worse. A large part of my work when I became a houseman involved taking more blood, unblocking urinary catheters and siting intravenous drips – usually in the middle of a night on call, when I'd just got back to sleep. Boring, repetitive tasks. Important to the patient, of course, but of no apparent value to me. In time I became adept at doing these tasks, but I couldn't see why it needed six years at medical school to stick needles into people's veins. Why couldn't someone else do it?

But this was the first step on my path to becoming expert. Here, you're so inexperienced that you don't even know what you don't know. You can't see the bigger picture. Your fingers are all thumbs. Often you're scared and bored at the same time. You're thinking about yourself.

All the experts I've talked to told me a similar story.

Paul Jakeman is now one of the country's leading historic stone carvers. Soon after I met him, he showed me the massive stone unicorn he carved for the steeple of St George's, Bloomsbury, in central London. Weighing several tons, it replaces the original in what is one of Nicholas Hawksmoor's iconic churches. But Paul hasn't always been carving unicorns. When he started his stone-carving apprenticeship several decades ago, he had no idea what to expect.

He'd imagined himself on a high ladder, restoring medieval statues in an English cathedral. But instead he spent weeks sweeping up stone dust in the mason's yard and making the tea. The first task his master set him was to create a perfectly flat horizontal surface in a block of stone, using only a chisel and a dummy (a mason's mallet). As the months went past and his block of stone grew smaller, he almost went out of his mind with boredom. Finally he showed his work to his master, who declared himself satisfied. At last, Paul thought, the real work would begin. But he spent the next six months with another block of stone, this time creating a perfectly flat vertical surface. He almost went out of his mind with boredom – again. But it wasn't until he'd mastered those basics that he was ready to go near anything that mattered.

So how can you make sense of this repetitive work? As you struggle with pocket flaps, or bloods, or vertical stone surfaces during your first apprenticeship, you discover something important. As Joshua put it to me: you can allow yourself to go out of your mind with frustration, switching off your brain and letting your mind wander as you endure the tedium. Or you can do something about it.

The secret to coping with boredom is to focus on doing each task as well as you possibly can – whatever that task is. It may sound obvious, but it's up to you to decide whether you find something boring, and you can change that if you choose. By paying close attention to tedious work, you reframe it. Instead of being a waste of time, it becomes a means of moving forward. You shift your focus from the frustration of the task to the skills you are gaining by doing it. Joshua told me that he came to see pocket flaps as an opportunity to hone his skills. The expert sewing he showed when I first met him would never have developed without that repetition.

By deciding to be ‘present' in his work and concentrate on it fully, Joshua made rapid progress. He became familiar with his materials. He reframed that never-ending pile of pocket flaps as a series of opportunities to improve and develop. If he had been listening to the radio or chatting to a friend while he worked, he wouldn't have been paying attention. He might have learned how to do the tasks, but he would never have found out why he was doing them. He wouldn't have progressed. Paul the stone carver had a similar experience. By gritting his teeth and perfecting those horizontal and vertical surfaces, he laid the foundations for the effortless skill he eventually developed.

The reality is that in any job there's a lot that's tedious, but it just has to be done. Nobody is entitled not to be bored. Unless you find ways of accepting that, you're likely to have a hard time. Yet in our climate of immediate gratification and continual stimulation, coping with tasks that are inherently boring is becoming a lost art. We tend to think that tedious tasks should be hived off, to technology or to other people. But this is missing the point. The boring bits are part of the work. Bypass them and you lose something essential.

For many experts, the boring parts remain central to what they do throughout their career. Andrew Garlick has been making harpsichords for over forty-five years, and his instruments are in demand all over the world. His signature instrument is a double-manual harpsichord, based on a 1749 French masterpiece by Goujon that is today housed in a Parisian museum.

Andrew makes every part of each harpsichord himself. From shaping the soundboard and cutting out the keys, to stringing the instrument and painting the case, he does it all by hand. It's very labour-intensive, and he can only make five harpsichords a year. I asked him if he had help for doing the boring bits, and he said no. For him, the boring bits are part of the satisfaction of making a whole instrument, of knowing that he has created everything from start to finish. Although cutting all those keys is a tedious task that somebody else could do, Andrew recognizes that it's part of doing ‘good work'. Boring or not, he has reframed it as worthwhile. The tedious tasks are part of being responsible for the work he does. That responsibility is part of becoming expert.

如果你一直难以掌握某件新事物的诀窍，你就会熟悉这种挫败感。这是学徒阶段必然会有的经历。裁缝约书亚在开始学做西装时，也有过类似的经历。在那个阶段，他做的不是设计三件套西装，就像我不是在做手术一样。他在师父罗恩家的工坊里做袋盖。他做了好几百个袋盖，这让他苦不堪言。

做袋盖不像听起来那么简单。袋盖必须经过非常精确的剪裁，才能贴合西装的精致的曲线，这样在移动时衣袋才不会开口。袋盖必须缝得极其精准，看起来必须完美，但制作过程却是重复乏味的。罗恩要求严格，在自己的工坊里秉持最高的标准，但他不擅长教学。他会时不时地扫一眼约书亚的作品，然后摇摇头说：「不行。」没有解释，只有「不行」。他并不满意，但从来不说为什么。于是约书亚不得不继续做袋盖。他无聊得几乎要发疯了。

就像我刚开始采血一样，约书亚也会有初学者的运气。他有时也能做出让罗恩满意的袋盖，但那只是侥幸，约书亚没法再做出一个这样的袋盖。很长一段时间里，他都不知道自己做得怎么样。渐渐地，他开始能分辨出自己的手艺什么时候好，什么时候不好。所有这些重复劳动让约书亚能够为自己的工作设定标准，提高工作水平的一致性。最后，罗恩满意了，就允许他去做别的事情了。直到今天，约书亚一想到袋盖，就会想起那些无聊的、重复的、没有明显价值的事情。然而，我们会看到，袋盖在这个世界上的确有其价值。如果没有这段经历，约书亚就不可能成为今天的裁缝大师。同样地，如果没做过采血，我也不可能成为外科医生。每个领域内都有类似的事情。

当然，约书亚做的不仅仅是袋盖。在那些年里，约书亚做了许多重复的劳动。在袋盖之后，他还做过纽扣孔、缝过边缘、缝过里布、插过垫料、给翻领定过型。后来，他还被委以更困难的任务，如缝合袖子、领子和内麻衬。但是每项任务都需要重复，很快就会变得单调乏味。

我在职业发展的过程中也有过类似的经历。作为一名医学生已经够让人沮丧的了，但你一旦获得医师资格，情况就会变得更糟糕。在我成为实习医生的时候，我的大部分工作都涉及采集更多的血液、疏通导尿管、插静脉滴注套管 —— 通常是在半夜我刚睡着的时候被叫起来。全是一些无聊、重复性的任务。

当然这些对患者很重要，但对我没有明显的价值。随着时间的推移，我变得很擅长这些任务，但我不明白为什么要在医学院里学六年才能把针扎进人的血管里。为什么不能让别人去做？

但这是我成为专家的第一步。在这个时候，你太缺乏经验了，甚至不知道自己不知道什么。你看不到全局。你笨手笨脚。

你常常既感到害怕，又感到无聊。你在想着自己。与我交流过的所有专家都给我讲过类似的故事。保罗·杰克曼（Paul Jakeman）是当下英国最著名的历史石雕大师之一。我见到他后不久，他就给我看了他为伦敦市中心布鲁姆斯伯里区的圣乔治教堂尖塔雕刻的巨大独角兽石雕。

这个石雕重达数吨，取代了一座原本位于此处的尼古拉斯·霍克斯莫尔（Nicholas Hawksmoor）的标志性教堂。但是，保罗并不是一直都在雕刻独角兽。几十年前，在他开始做石匠学徒的时候，他不知道自己会遇到什么事情。

保罗曾想象自己站在高高的梯子上，修复英格兰教堂里的中世纪雕像。但是，他却花了好几周的时间打扫石匠院子里的石屑和泡茶。师父给他的第一项任务，就是在一块石头上雕出一个完美的水平面，只能用凿子和石匠槌。几个月过去了，他的那块石头越来越小，而他无聊得几乎要发疯了。最后，他把自己的作品拿给师父看，师父表示满意。保罗想，终于可以开始做真正的工作了。但是在接下来的六个月里，他一直在打磨另一块石头，这次他要雕出一个完美的垂直面。他再次无聊得几乎要发疯了。但只有在掌握这些基本技巧以后，他才能尝试做其他重要的事情。

所以，该如何理解这种重复劳动呢？在学徒阶段，当你摸索着制作袋盖、采血或者在石头上雕刻垂直面时，你会发现一些重要的东西。正如约书亚对我说的：你可以任由自己因沮丧而失去理智，在忍受无聊时封闭自己的大脑，让自己走神；你也可以对此做点儿什么。

应对无聊的秘诀就是尽你所能地专注于每一项任务 —— 无论任务是什么。这听起来可能像是废话，但只有你能决定自己是否觉得某件事情无聊 —— 而且如果你愿意，就能改变这种现状。通过密切关注乏味的工作，你就能赋予它新的意义。这样一来，这种工作就不再是浪费时间，而是一种进步的方式。你要把关注点从这项任务带来的挫败感上转移到你从中获得的技能上。约书亚告诉我，他把制作袋盖看作磨炼技能的机会。如果没有重复，他就不会发展出我们初次见面时展现出来的高超缝纫技术。

通过全神贯注地「投入」工作，约书亚取得了快速的进步。他熟悉了他的工作内容。他给那种没完没了地制作袋盖的工作赋予了新的意义：进步和发展的机会。如果他在工作时收听广播或和朋友聊天，就不会专心工作。那样即便他已经学会了如何做这些事情，也永远不会弄清自己为什么要做。他不会进步。

石匠保罗也有类似的经历。通过咬紧牙关、不断完善石雕上的水平面和垂直面，他为自己打下了基础，最终发展出了那种毫不费力的技巧。

事实上，任何工作中都有许多乏味的事情，但那是必须去做的。没有人有权利摆脱无聊。除非你能设法接受这一事实，否则你可能会度日如年。然而，我们的社会环境需要即时满足和持续刺激，处理无聊任务的能力正在成为一种失落的技艺。

我们倾向于认为乏味的工作应该被分割出来，交给科技或其他人来做，但这样会错失其中的重点。无聊的事情是工作的一部分。避开这些部分，你就会失去一些至关重要的东西。

对于许多专家来说，无聊的部分仍然是他们本职工作中的核心部分。安德鲁·加里克（Andrew Garlick）制作羽管键琴已经超过 45 年了，他的乐器在世界各地都很受欢迎。他制作的标志性乐器是双层羽管键琴，其原型是古戎（Goujon）在法国于 1749 年制作的杰作（如今收藏在巴黎的一家博物馆里）。

每台羽管键琴的每个部件都是安德鲁自己制作的。制作音板、雕刻琴键、上弦、涂漆，都是他手工完成的。这是一项繁重的劳动，他一年只能制作五台羽管键琴。我问他有没有人帮他做这些无聊的事，他说没有。制造一台完整的乐器，知道自己从头到尾创造了这台乐器的一切，会给他带来一种满足感；

对他来说，这些无聊的部分是这种满足感的一部分。虽然雕刻那些琴键是一项乏味的任务，其他人也可以做，但安德鲁意识到，这是「做好」工作的一部分。不管这种事情是否无聊，他都会另眼相待，将其视为有价值的东西。枯燥乏味的工作体现了他为自己工作所负的责任，而这种责任是成为专家的一部分。

### 3.2 学习团队合作

Learning to work in a team

In this early stage in our apprenticeships, Joshua, Paul and I were working in someone else's territory, on their terms. We had little agency. It was the same after I qualified as a doctor and started to specialize. Early on I knew I wanted to become a surgeon, so I took every opportunity to be in the operating theatre. What I really wanted was to do operations myself, but instead I was only allowed to ‘assist'. This involved holding on to retractors to keep organs out of the way, so that the chief surgeon could get a good view.

I spent hours clutching the handle of a curved metal instrument whose other end was out of sight, being yelled at by the surgeon when I let it slip. I was at the bottom of the heap, and in a big operation with several assistants there were times when I couldn't see anything at all. Nobody gives a damn about the comfort of the third assistant, and I often ended up grappling with boredom and backache at the same time. I could see why American surgical residents described retractors as ‘idiot sticks', because even an idiot could hold one. It seemed a complete waste of time. Why couldn't someone else do it?

Having been the lead surgeon in countless operations since, I now realize how important it is for everyone to focus on their part. I know how exasperating it can be when a member of your team stops concentrating. You're about to clip and tie a bleeding artery, when a loop of intestine slips out from behind the retractor your assistant is supposed to be holding. The artery disappears from view and you have to start all over again. It's infuriating. For the bored assistant, it's just another example of them not yet understanding the bigger picture – of not recognizing the value of essential, albeit dull, work.

When I started my surgical training at Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto, I had to take my turn draining abscesses in the septic theatre. These were the cases more experienced surgeons didn't want to do. There's little glamour in pus, and I was left to carry out these smelly procedures on my own. Of course, I knew abscesses were horrible for the patients who had them, and I tried to do these procedures as well as I could, but at the time I didn't find them very interesting.

Later, I experienced something similar as a GP trainee. One of my jobs was to see the ‘extras' – the patients who turned up after the morning or evening session had finished and needed to be squeezed in. Mostly they had straightforward problems: children with earache, women wanting the morning-after pill, or people whose repeat prescription had run out. To me at the time, this part of the work seemed almost trivial. But it wasn't trivial at all, and I was learning far more than I realized. The starting point for any expert is to spend time – lots of time – in the world you'll be joining. You have to become familiar with the materials, tools and people who make up that world. It's often tedious and dispiriting, but unless you put in that time, you won't leave the starting blocks.

Of course, you don't start entirely from scratch when you become an Apprentice; the path to becoming expert begins way back, in early childhood. Long before I was studying anatomy, let alone doing the bloods on a hospital ward, I was gathering relevant knowledge and skills. At home and at primary school I learned how to read, to write and to make. I tried out lots of things and got them wrong. At secondary school the process continued: I absorbed more facts, I did more with my hands. I learned the rudiments of science, of what to do in a laboratory. And, like everyone else, I worked with people. I learned how to get along with the children in my class, including the ones I didn't like and who didn't like me. It's the same for all the experts in this book and any of you reading it. Joshua the tailor and Paul the stone carver had both been working with their hands for decades before they started their chosen careers, and they'd been working with other people.

In order to join any group, you have to earn your place. As we've seen, this usually starts off by doing the jobs that nobody else wants. Often, these tasks act as a rite of passage, an initiation. When you're learning martial arts in Japan, you start by cleaning the sensei's rice bowl. When you're making pocket flaps, or taking blood samples for the coming week's operating list, you're showing your willingness to be part of the work as a whole, not just cherry-picking the bits you find interesting.

When you start, you're at the bottom of the pile. You get the jobs nobody else wants. You can't see how your tasks fit with what other people are doing. The work is often irksome and you have to do what you're told. Nobody cares whether you like it or not, and you feel like a cog in a machine. When I started as a houseman, a doctor who had been in the team a year longer than I had took me to one side and explained how things worked. ‘It's simple really, Roger,' he said. ‘Shit flows downhill and you're at the bottom.'

在学徒阶段的早期，约书亚、保罗和我都在别人的领域里工作，按照他们的要求做事。我们几乎没有自己的能动性。在我取得医师资格并开始专攻某一领域之后，情况依然如此。我很早就知道自己想做一名外科医生，所以我抓住了每一个待在手术室里的机会。我真正想要的是自己做手术，但别人只允许我「协助」他们。这项任务包括握住牵开器，拨开碍事的器官，这样主刀的外科医生就能看清患者的情况了。

我要一连好几个小时握着一个弯曲金属器械的手柄，却看不见它的另一端在哪儿。我要是没拿稳，外科医生就会冲我大叫。我是最底层的工作者。在一场大型手术中有好几名助手，而我有时什么也看不见。没有人在乎第三助手舒不舒服，我经常在无聊和背痛中苦苦挣扎。我可以理解为什么美国的外科住院医生管牵开器叫「傻瓜棒」，因为即使傻瓜也能拿住它。这似乎完全是浪费时间。为什么不能让别人来做呢？

后来，作为无数次手术的主刀外科医生，我意识到了每个人专注于自己的任务有多么重要。我知道团队成员不能集中注意力有多么让人恼火。你正要夹住流血的动脉并打结，一节肠子却从你助手本应拿住的牵开器后面滑了出来。动脉从视野中消失了，你不得不重新来过。这会让人火冒三丈。对于百无聊赖的助手来说，这只是他们尚不理解大局的另一个例子 —— 他们没有认识到这种无聊但重要的工作的价值。

我在索韦托的巴拉瓜纳医院开始接受外科训练的时候，我必须在脓肿治疗室里给患者的脓肿引流。这些都是有经验的外科医生不愿意做的事情。脓液可不是什么有意思的东西，而我必须独自完成这些臭烘烘的事情。当然，我知道脓肿对于患者来说是可怕的，我会尽我所能地做好这些事情，但我觉得这没什么意思。

后来，我在做实习全科医生的时候也遇到了类似的事情。我的一项工作就是照看「临时患者」—— 那些在上午和晚间工作时间后来的患者，我们要为他们挤出时间。他们的问题大多很简单：耳朵疼的孩子，想要紧急避孕药的妇女，或者处方药吃完、需要拿药的人。对于当时的我来说，这部分工作似乎是微不足道的。但这根本不是微不足道的事情，我学到的东西比我意识到的多得多。任何专家的起点，都是花时间（许多时间）待在你即将加入的世界里。你必须熟悉构成这个世界的工作对象、工具和人员。这个过程通常既乏味又令人沮丧，但除非你投入时间，否则你不会离开起点。

当然，你在成为学徒的时候，不会完全从零开始；成为专家的旅程在童年早期就已经开始了。早在我学习解剖学之前（更早于在医院病房采血的时候），我就已经在收集相关的知识和技能了。我在家和小学里学会了读、写和手工。我尝试过许多东西，也犯过很多错误。到了中学，这个过程还在继续：我学习了更多的知识，用双手做了更多的事情。我学到了一些基本的科学知识，知道了在实验室里该做什么。就像其他人一样，我也会和别人合作。我学会了如何与班上的孩子相处，包括我不喜欢和不喜欢我的孩子。本书里的所有专家和阅读本书的所有读者都是如此。在从事自己选择的职业之前，裁缝约书亚和石匠保罗都用自己的双手工作了二三十年，而且他们也一直在和其他人一起工作。

为了加入任何团体，你必须赢得自己的位置。正如我们所见，这通常都始于做别人不想做的工作。这些任务通常就像是一种过渡仪式，一种入门仪式。你在日本学习武术时，首先要给师父洗碗。你在制作袋盖时，或者为下一周手术名单上的患者采集血液样本时，你就表明了你愿意投身于这份工作的全部，而不是挑肥拣瘦，只做你觉得有意思的部分。

在开始的时候，你要从最底层做起。你做的都是别人都不想做的工作。你看不出自己的任务与别人的工作有什么关系。

这些工作常常令人厌烦，别人叫你做什么你就得做什么。没有人在乎你喜不喜欢，你觉得自己就像机器上的一颗齿轮。我开始做实习医生的时候，有一个比我早来一年的医生把我叫到一边，向我解释那里的规矩。「罗杰，其实很简单，」他说，「屎往低处滚，而你就在最低处。」

shit flows downhill，俚语，指坏的结果由弱小的一方承担。—— 译者注

### 3.3 实践社群

Communities of practice

One important outcome of this frustrating work is that you get good at skills you'll need later on. Like it or not, you have to be able to take blood or make pocket flaps. But another aspect is that you join a community of practice.

The idea of communities of practice was developed by Jean Lave, a social anthropologist, and Etienne Wenger, a teacher with an interest in artificial intelligence. According to their thinking, we are all members of multiple communities. When we join a football club, change our job, learn a new skill or go into a different class at school, we are becoming part of a new community. Each community is made up of concentric circles, and we start on the periphery. But even when we're on the edge we are ‘legitimate participants' and we have the right to be there. We've joined the football club, so we're different to somebody who is thinking about joining the football club. But even though we've made a start, we can't do much yet. There's a lot to learn before we become a member of the team.

Learning on the job can be scary. Sometimes people show you what to do and how the system works, but often they don't. They just expect you to know. But how can you?

Soon after my experience with the bloods, I went into the operating theatre for the first time. A kindly houseman in the changing room showed me how to find scrubs and boots of about the right size, how to put on a cap and mask, and which theatre to go into. Feeling very professional, I went through the doors to where an operation was in full swing. Suddenly someone screamed ‘DON'T DO THAT!' and everyone turned to stare at me. I wanted to fall through a hole in the floor. To this day I've no idea what I did wrong. All I know is that I broke some rule I didn't even know existed.

So how can we make sense of something like that when it happens? As a newcomer, a lot of what goes on in a community seems incomprehensible. Gradually the newness wears off and we get to know people, we watch how things work, we find out how people ‘do things around here'. It's a slow process, but all that time we are learning from others in the group. The junior doctor who told me ‘shit flows downhill and you're at the bottom' was only slightly more experienced than me, but he had learned something I hadn't. He had become part of the community I was only starting to join. He had an insider's understanding of how it really worked, and he let me into a secret the books had never told me.

As you spend time in a community, you move towards its centre. Lave and Wenger's term for this is ‘legitimate peripheral participation'. It's a clunky phrase, but it captures the process of moving to and fro. They use it to speak ‘about the relations between newcomers and old-timers, and about activities, identities, artifacts, and communities of knowledge and practice'.

Communities have fluid boundaries, and relationships between colleagues shift and re-form. When I was taking blood and re-siting drips in the middle of the night, I was at the centre of a community of junior doctors. But when I presented the patients to my consultant on the ward round the next day, the landscape had shifted. She was at the centre and I had moved back towards the edge.

In any group, you gradually become more confident, moving steadily inwards. But whenever you join a new community of practice, you start all over again. Things which have become second nature as a central participant in one community may no longer hold when you are peripheral in another. This happened to me every time I moved up a stage in the surgical hierarchy, from being a houseman to a registrar, then from registrar to consultant. Every time you progress to another level, you have to do an equivalent of taking bloods or making pocket flaps. Whatever your area of interest, you'll have your own experience of moving across boundaries.

By doing time, Joshua the tailor, Paul the stone carver and I were each forming a bedrock of essential knowledge without realizing it. This knowledge isn't just theoretical. It's the knowledge of ‘doing': the physicality of materials and bodies. It doesn't come from books and you have to experience it for yourself, stocking an internal library of sensations, muscular actions and familiarity with your materials – especially when those materials are other people.

这项令人沮丧的工作能带来一个重要的结果，那就是你会熟练掌握你以后需要的技能。不管你喜不喜欢，你都必须掌握采血或制作袋盖的方法。另一个重要的结果是，你加入了一个实践社群。

实践社群的概念是由社会人类学家让·莱夫（Jean Lave）与教师艾蒂安·温格（Etienne Wenger）提出的，后者对人工智能很感兴趣。在他们看来，我们都是多个社群的成员。当我们加入足球俱乐部、换工作、学习新技能或在学校里进入另一个班级时，我们都会成为一个新社群的成员。每个社群都是由多个同心圆构成的，我们一开始位于最外围的圈上。即使我们处在边缘地带，我们也是「正当的参与者」，有权利待在那里。我们已经加入了足球俱乐部，所以我们与正在考虑加入的人不同。但是，即使我们已经加入了俱乐部，我们能做的还是很少。我们还有很多东西要学，然后才能成为队伍里的一员。

在工作中学习可能会让人害怕。他人有时会告诉你该做什么以及社群的运作方式，但他们常常不会这样做。他们只会认为你应该知道。但你怎么可能知道呢？

在我做采血工作之后不久，我就第一次走进了手术室。在更衣室里，一位好心的实习医生告诉我如何找到尺寸合适的外科手术服和手术鞋，如何戴上手术帽和口罩，以及该去哪间手术室。穿戴完毕，我感觉自己很专业，于是穿过大门，来到一间手术室：一场手术正进行到最紧张的时刻。突然有人大叫：「别这样做！」所有人都转过头来盯着我。我真想找个地缝钻进去。

时至今日我依然不知道我当时做错了什么。我只知道我违反了一条我根本不知道的规则。

那么，当这种事情发生时，我们该如何看待呢？对于一个新人来说，实践社群里有很多事似乎都是无法理解的。渐渐地，陌生感消失了，我们开始了解其他人，观察事物的运作方式，弄清了大家「在这儿是怎么做事的」。这是一个缓慢的过程，但我们一直在向群体中的其他人学习。那个告诉我「屎往低处滚，而你就在最低处」的实习医生，他的经验只比我多一点点，但他学到了一些我不了解的东西。他已经成了这个社群的一员，而我才刚刚加入。他对社群的真实运作方式了如指掌，他让我了解了一个书本从未告诉我的秘密。

你在一个社群里待上一段时间后，就会朝它的核心前进。莱夫和温格用这个术语来描述这个过程：合法的边缘性参与（legitimate peripheral participation）。虽然这是一个拗口的术语，但很好地描述了这种变化的过程。他们用这个术语来描述「与知识和实践相关的活动、身份认同、产物与社群」。

社群的边界会不断变化，成员间的关系会改变和重新建立。在半夜采血和放置静脉滴注套管的时候，我是社区医疗中心实习医生里的核心成员。但是，当我第二天在病房里向顾问医师介绍患者情况的时候，我的身份就发生了变化。她位于中心地位，而我退回了边缘。

在任何群体里，你都会逐渐增长自信，不断向内移动。但是，每当你加入一个新的实践社群，你都会重新开始。当你身处另一个社群的边缘时，有些对于原先社群的核心参与者来说再自然不过的事情，也都不再适用了。每当我在外科医生的职级中晋升的时候，这种事情就会发生 —— 从实习医生到住院医生，再从住院医生到顾问医师。每当你晋升到另一个级别，你都得做类似采血或制作袋盖的事情。无论你对哪个领域感兴趣，你都会有跨越边界的经历。

通过积累，裁缝约书亚、石匠保罗和我都在不知不觉间打下了重要的知识基础。这种知识不仅是理论知识。这是「做」的知识：是有关工作对象与身体的物理特性的知识。这种知识不是从书本上得来的，你必须自己去体验，在脑海中存储一系列感觉、肌肉动作以及对于工作对象的感知 —— 尤其是当这些对象是其他人的时候。

### 3.4 与他人一起工作

Working with people

Some experts spend most of their time with other people. Hairstylists are a good example. Fabrice Ringuet has over thirty years' experience as a stylist and a teacher. He has been director of training at the Toni & Guy Academy and now runs masterclasses. He has spent years distilling his knowledge and skills as he trains apprentice hairstylists. For Fabrice, like me, doing time started with the jobs no one else wanted, such as sweeping the floor between customers or making tea for the clients as they waited. It was boring, frustrating work which stopped him from doing what he really wanted – to cut, to style, to be creative.

Gradually, Fabrice began to work directly with customers. After doing menial tasks for a long time, he progressed to washing clients' hair. In the process, he learned what hair looked and felt like – long hair, short hair, straight and curly, old and young. At the same time, he learned about people, and about himself. He learned to overcome his shyness, gently massaging each client's scalp as he applied the shampoo.

But when he started washing hair, Fabrice would get things wrong. Like all trainee stylists, he'd sometimes get soap in a client's eyes. He had to apologize, put things right and retain their confidence in the salon. Like me with the bloods, Fabrice was relating to people. He studied how to approach clients as they were sitting in a chair and watching him in the mirror. He learned how to enter their personal space without making them feel uncomfortable. Eventually, though, he progressed to cutting a straight edge in long hair. Though it was a seemingly simple task, it pushed him to a new level, and once again he discovered how difficult his craft could be.

During those endless hours of sweeping up and shampooing, then cutting straight edges in long hair, Fabrice was laying the foundations of his later expertise. As he developed his skills, he was moving towards the centre of a community of practice. He would draw on this experience later in his career, when he took responsibility for teaching other stylists.

This kind of knowledge can't be rushed or short-circuited. You have to build it up through experience, and it sets its own pace. Like making a cake, you can't finish it in half the time by baking it at twice the temperature. Learning to ‘do' is not like cramming facts for an exam and forgetting it all a week later. The process takes time and has to ripen.

This bodily awareness is like a language learned through constant practice. How much pressure to apply, when to back off or take a break, and when to call for help – all these kinds of knowing evolve at their own speed and cannot be forced. Once mastered, however, the slow knowing pays dividends. Those cumbersome steps and unfamiliar movements become automatic, an unconscious part of what you do. Eventually, you stop thinking about component skills and focus instead on the outcome.

All of us learned our skills by doing tedious things again and again. Joshua's sewing needle became an extension of his hands, and in the end he didn't have to think about it. I could get blood from almost anyone with my syringe and needle, even when I was half asleep. Paul Jakeman could make a flat stone surface on autopilot, and Fabrice could cut someone's long hair in a straight line while chatting to them about their holiday. Eventually, we no longer relied on beginner's luck. We could make our materials do what we wanted every time. To get to that stage, though, we had to become comfortable with our materials.

To a non-specialist, it may seem that cloth is just cloth and stone is just stone. Human bodies, too, seem roughly similar. And at first glance you might think that hair is just hair. But this isn't the case at all. Cutting a straight line in two different types of long hair is a different physical experience.

It's the same with all materials. Every length of cloth, every piece of stone and every person is infinitely varied. It is impossible to learn a technique in the abstract. Skills only make sense in the context of that length of cloth, that piece of granite, that unique human being.

So far I've talked about the physical world. But ‘materials' don't have to be something you can touch or see. If you're working with words, with stocks and shares, or with computer code, you are engaging with the materials of your work. Learning to handle these intangibles takes just as much time as working with their physical counterparts. You still have to spend time grappling with the basics, then learning how to shape and mould them.

有些专家大部分时间里都在和他人一起工作。发型设计师就是一个很好的例子。法布里斯·兰盖（Fabrice Ringuet）拥有 30 多年发型设计与教学的经验。他是托尼盖美发学院（Toni＆Guy Academy）的培训总监，现在正在开办大师课程。他花了很多年时间培训见习发型师，在这个过程中提炼自己的知识和技能。法布里斯和我一样，都是从做没人愿意做的工作开始积累经验的，比如在顾客接受服务的间隙里扫地，或者在顾客等待的时候为他们沏茶。这份工作很枯燥、令人沮丧，让他不能做他真正想做的事情 —— 剪发、美发、创造。

渐渐地，法布里斯开始直接与客户打交道。干了很长一段时间卑微的工作之后，他开始给顾客洗头了。在这个过程中，他了解了头发的样子与质地 —— 长发、短发、直发、卷发、老人和年轻人的头发。与此同时，他了解了别人，也了解了自己。他学会了克服害羞的心理，一边涂洗发水，一边轻轻地按摩每一位顾客的头皮。

但是，在法布里斯开始洗头时，他常常犯错。就像所有的见习发型师一样，他有时会把洗发水弄到顾客的眼睛里。他不得不道歉，纠正错误，让顾客保持对美发店的信心。就像我在采血时一样，法布里斯也开始了解他人了。他学会了如何与坐在椅子上、打量镜中自己的顾客打交道。他学会了如何进入顾客的个人空间而不让他们感觉不舒服。渐渐地，他开始学着给长发修剪直边。虽然这是一项看似简单的任务，但法布里斯有了新的理解。他再次发现自己所学的手艺是多么复杂。

在无数个小时的扫地、洗头、给长发剪直边的过程中，法布里斯为他后来的专长打下了基础。随着技能的发展，他逐渐走向了实践社群的中心。在职业生涯后期，负责教授其他发型设计师的时候，他会用上这些经验。

这种知识的学习不能操之过急，也没有捷径可走。你必须有经验的积累，遵循这个过程固有的节奏。这就像做蛋糕一样，即使你用两倍的温度来烤，也无法把烤制的时间缩短一半。学「做事」不同于为了考试死记硬背，而一周后就把知识全都忘了。这个过程需要时间，需要逐渐发展到瓜熟蒂落的时刻。

形成这种身体的意识，就像通过不断练习来学习语言。该给自己多大的压力，何时退后或休息，何时寻求帮助 —— 所有这些知识都会按照自身的速度积累，不能揠苗助长。然而，一旦掌握了这些缓慢发展的知识就会有回报。那些笨拙的操作步骤和不熟悉的动作会变成自动化、无意识的，成为你行为方式的一部分。最后，你不会再考虑这些不同方面的技能，而会关注结果。

我们所有人都是通过一次又一次地做乏味的事情来学习技能的。约书亚的缝衣针成了他双手的延伸，最后他根本不必再留意它。有了注射器和针头，我几乎可以从任何人身上采血，即使是在半睡半醒的时候。保罗·杰克曼可以在不思考的情况下雕刻出平坦的石头表面，而法布里斯可以一边和别人聊他们的假期见闻，一边给他们的长发剪出直边。最终，我们都不用再依赖初学者的运气。我们可以随时让我们的工作对象呈现出我们想要的样子。然而，为了达到这个阶段，我们必须对这些东西了如指掌。

对于非专业人士而言，可能布就是布，石就是石。人体似乎也大同小异。乍一看，你可能以为头发只是头发，但实际上没有这么简单。给两种不同的长发剪直边，是两种不同的身体体验。

对于所有的工作对象都是如此。每一匹布、每一块石头、每一个人都有着无限的变化。我们无法用抽象的形式学习一种技术。只有面对那匹布、那块花岗岩、那个独一无二的人的时候，技能才有意义。

到目前为止，我讨论的是物质的世界。但是「工作对象」不一定是你可以触摸或看见的东西。如果你在与文字、股票与证券，或计算机代码打交道，那你也是在接触自己的工作对象。

学习处理这些无形的东西所需的时间，与那些有形的事物是一样的。你依然需要花时间掌握基本知识，然后学习如何改变和塑造这些知识。

### 3.5 减少意外

Minimizing surprise

Certainly the skills which Joshua and I and the others mastered are useful in their own right. Jackets need pocket flaps and patients need blood taken. These tasks may not be interesting to the person doing them, but they have to be done. But there's more. By doing that repetitive work, we not only spent time with our materials and our tools, we became part of multiple systems. The first is the community of practice I described earlier. The second is the physical system by which any workplace is structured and set out, which I'll examine in the next chapter. The third is the internal system within our heads which we populate by repetition. This can be explained by a neuroscientific concept called ‘predictive coding'.

The idea here is that the brain's job is not to absorb and process everything. Instead, it is meant to minimize surprise. The more you've experienced, the less surprised you'll be. This is particularly true of things that look roughly the same. For instance, each piece of cloth you work with might be different, but making a pocket flap to a specification minimizes variation. That makes life easier. As I got the hang of the bloods, I started to recognize patterns – to spot which veins were like clay pipe stems, and which ones would burst into huge bruises at the touch of a needle. I became aware of a landscape of common variations, and I adapted my technique accordingly. Like a beginner at chess or bridge, I came to realize that the number of common opening gambits is relatively small. Once I knew them, I could often see trouble coming before it arrived. That's predictive coding.

As we develop, our brains assemble a series of ‘probability priors' – predictions of what is likely to happen next. If the outcomes happen as anticipated, the brain doesn't do much. It just recognizes that things are as it expected. But if the anticipated outcomes don't happen, the brain registers surprise and takes appropriate action. Our prior knowledge sets hypotheses and tells us what's likely to happen. Our senses provide confirming or disconfirming evidence.

The difference between experts and non-experts in a field is that the experts have built up a rich set of expectations based on their previous experience, so they can ‘sample for difference'. That stops them having to waste energy in processing everything they encounter. Non-experts, on the other hand, have to start from scratch, analysing and interpreting information from all their senses.

This helps to explain the value of doing time – the gradual exposure to a range of experiences and sensory impressions that prime the brain with a knowledge of what to expect. That kind of knowing takes a long time to gain, but once embedded it is seldom lost. The traditional example is riding a bicycle. Those early experiences of interacting with the physical world – balance, coordination, the sensation of gravity – allow us to get on an unfamiliar bicycle years after we first learned, and ride without falling off. Even when verbal memory unravels, this physical memory often persists. And it applies to the world of surgery too.

I discovered this a couple of years ago when I was talking to Mrs Florence Thomas. When we met, she was ninety-seven and had just gone into a nursing home. I was doing some research into the history of surgical operations in the twentieth century, and I was keen to talk to Florence because I knew she had been a senior scrub nurse in a London teaching hospital during the Second World War. I wanted to ask her what that was like.

Florence had helped to run the operating theatres during the Blitz. Later in the war, she met a serviceman and they decided to get married. At that time, nursing was for unmarried women only. You could be a nurse or you could be married, but not both. So Florence left her profession, married the serviceman, had a family and never had anything more to do with healthcare. When I met her some seventy years later, her memory was very poor. She had difficulty recollecting anything about those days, or putting her experiences into words. At first I thought we weren't going to have much of a conversation.

By chance, though, I had a surgical instrument in my briefcase and I gave it to her. Turning it over in her hands, she began moving its tip in a circle as if putting in a suture. Then, to my astonishment, she told me its technical name. ‘These were called artery forceps, as far as I remember,' she said. When I asked her how she would pass that instrument to a surgeon, she turned it round and slapped the handle down in the unmistakeable manner of an experienced theatre nurse. Even when her words had failed, her body still remembered. The feel of that instrument reactivated her physical memory.

当然，约书亚、我，以及其他人掌握的技能有其自身的价值。西装上衣需要袋盖，患者需要采血。这些事情对于做事的人来说可能不太有趣，但必须有人来做。不仅如此，通过这些重复劳动，我们不仅把时间花在了工作对象和工具上，我们还成了多个系统的一部分。第一个系统就是我前面所说的实践社群。第二个系统是构成工作场所的物理系统，我会在下一章中探讨这个系统。第三个系统是我们头脑中的内部系统，我们会通过重复劳动丰富其中的内容。神经科学中有一个概念叫「预测性编码」（predictive coding），可以解释这种过程。

这个概念的大意是指，大脑的任务不是吸收和加工所有的信息，而是尽量减少意外的发生。你的经历越多，意外越少。对于那些看起来差不多的东西来说尤其如此。例如，你使用的每一块布料可能都是不同的，但根据规格制作袋盖可以最大限度地减少差异性。这样会减少很多麻烦。在熟练采血之后，我就能发现规律 —— 哪些血管像陶土烟杆，哪些血管会在针头的触碰下破裂，产生大片淤青。我了解了一些常见的可能性，于是相应地调整了我的技巧。就像国际象棋或桥牌的初学者一样，我意识到常见的开局方式是相对较少的。一旦了解了这些情况，我就往往能事先预见麻烦。这就是预测性编码。

在我们进步的过程中，我们的大脑会收集一系列「先验概率」，即对接下来可能会发生什么的预测。如果结果正如预期的那样，大脑就不会做太多事情。它只会确认事情正如它所料。

但是，如果预期的结果没有发生，大脑就会感到惊讶，并采取适当的行动。我们的先验知识持有一些假设，并告诉我们可能会发生什么。我们的感官会提供证实或证伪的证据。

一个领域的专家与非专家的区别在于，专家已经根据先前的经验，建立了一系列丰富的预期，所以他们能根据自己的「样本」来寻找差异。这就使他们不会在遇到所有事情时浪费精力去思考。然而，非专家必须从零开始，分析并解读他们所有感官收集到的信息。

这有助于解释积累的价值 —— 让我们逐渐地暴露于一系列体验与感觉印象里，让大脑熟悉即将发生的事情。这种知识需要很长时间才能获得，可一旦掌握，就很少会失去。最经典的例子就是骑自行车。这种与物质世界互动的早期经历 —— 平衡、协调，以及重力带给我们的感觉，能让我们在首次学会骑车的多年以后，再次骑上一辆不熟悉的自行车时也不会摔下来。即使言语记忆消失了，这种身体记忆往往也会留存下来。这种道理也适用于外科领域。

几年前我在与弗洛伦丝·托马斯夫人（Mrs Florence Thomas）谈话时发现了这一点。我们见面的时候，她已经 97 岁了，刚刚住进了养老院。我当时在做一些关于 20 世纪外科手术历史的研究，我很想和弗洛伦丝谈谈，因为我知道在第二次世界大战期间，她是伦敦的一所教学医院里的资深洗手护士。我想问问她当时的情况。

弗洛伦丝曾在闪电战期间协助主持手术室的工作。在战争后期，她遇见了一名军人，他们决定结婚。当时，只有未婚女性才能做护士。你可以做护士，也可以结婚，但不能两全。于是弗洛伦丝离开了工作岗位，嫁给了这名军人，组建了家庭，再也没有和医疗卫生领域有任何关系。在大约 70 年后，当我见到她的时候，她的记性已经很差了。她很难回忆起当时的任何事情，也无法用语言讲述自己的经历。起初我以为我们不会有太多可谈的东西。

不过，我的公文包里碰巧有一件手术器械，我把器械给了她。她把这件器械拿在手里把玩，开始用它的尖端绕圈，就好像在缝合一样。接着，让我感到惊讶的是，她说出了这件器械的专业名称。「我记得这叫动脉钳。」她说。我问她该怎么把这件器械递给外科医生，她把动脉钳转过来，把它的把手向下拍在我手上，这毫无疑问是一个经验丰富的手术室护士的手法。

即使说话已经很难了，但她的身体依然记得。那件器械的触感重新激活了她的身体记忆。

### 3.6 专长的模型

Models of expertise

So how do people become expert? A lot has been written on the subject and many researchers have come up with conceptual models. A well-known one maps out four stages. It looks like this:

Unconscious incompetence is when you don't even know you can't do it.

Conscious incompetence is when you're painfully aware that you aren't much good.

Conscious competence is where you can do it if you concentrate, but you have to think about what you're doing.

Unconscious competence is the final stage, the effortless mastery of the true expert.

This makes sense when you think about learning to drive. You move from those initial lessons – when you can't coordinate the clutch with the gear lever, or turn the wheel and look in the mirror at the same time – to when you arrive home after a two-hour journey whose details you can't remember, because you were absorbed in a conversation with your passenger. The doing has become automatic, and the driving looks after itself. But how?

An influential figure in researching expertise is K. Anders Ericsson, whose lifelong work has become popularized by other writers such as Malcolm Gladwell. For decades, Ericsson has been studying ‘elite performers' in music, chess and other fields, trying to work out their secret. His research shows that all successful experts have put in at least ten years – or ten thousand hours – of practice. This magic figure has even become a mantra, enshrined in popular culture. But Ericsson's work is often misinterpreted as suggesting that anyone who has put in that amount of practice will inevitably become an expert. In fact, Ericsson is saying that nobody becomes an expert without having done their time – not that putting in ten thousand hours will guarantee success. There's more to becoming expert than just practice. If Joshua hadn't spent all that time making pocket flaps, he wouldn't be the master tailor he is today. But if he hadn't made sure to build on that skill and develop further, he would just be good at making pocket flaps. Now his work has gone far beyond the technical proficiency that repetition brings.

One of Ericsson's insights has been into the nature of practice. Many people reach what he calls a ‘stable performance asymptote' – good enough to do what they want, but without pushing themselves to become exceptional. This applies to anyone learning club-level tennis, for example, or driving a car. But if you want to become an expert, Ericsson says, it's no good just doing the same thing over and over again. Practice must be sustained, deliberate, supported by expert feedback, and carried out with the intention to improve. Otherwise it's just a job or a recreation.

Other writers see things differently. I especially like the concept of routine and adaptive expertise, developed by the educational researchers Carl Bereiter and Marlene Scardamalia. Routine expertise is when you learn to do something in a particular way, then do it that way each time. For repetitive tasks like taking blood, making pocket flaps or creating harpsichord keyboards, this works well. You don't want to invent a new technique every time you do a simple task, or spend unnecessary brainpower on repetitive work. Instead you become good at doing things in a specific way and can hand that task over to your internal autopilot. In the example of learning to drive, this is effective for dealing with predictable situations. The difficulty comes when something unexpected arises, because then you need to think differently. As the psychologist Abraham Maslow is credited with observing, ‘it is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail'. You interpret new problems in the light of pre-existing solutions. And that can lead to bad decisions.

Adaptive expertise, on the other hand, is about being able to come up with new approaches. People who develop adaptive expertise deliberately seek new challenges, putting themselves into uncomfortable positions that force them to think afresh. Becoming good at something that used to require effort frees up your mind, and adaptive experts use this spare capacity to improve their skills. Bereiter and Scardamalia describe this as ‘reinvesting freed-up attentional resources into progressive problem-solving'.

Returning to the driving example, instead of using that extra attentional capacity to talk with their passenger or listen to the radio, an adaptive expert might invest it in developing advanced driving techniques – reading the road more skilfully, driving in the fog, or practising in skid pans. I think we all have the capacity to develop both kinds of expertise, and to switch between routine and adaptive modes. When we do, the results can be life-changing. Or in Juan Manuel Fangio's case, life-saving.

It was 1950, and Fangio – one of the world's best racing drivers – was taking part in the Monaco Grand Prix. When a multi-car pile-up happened early in the race, Fangio was in the lead, one lap ahead and driving at top speed. The crash site was ahead of him but out of view, beyond the next corner. A fatal smash seemed inevitable. But instead of careering into the pile-up, Fangio suddenly slowed down and stopped just before he reached the wreckage. Asked about it later, he explained that in preparing for the race he had been looking at a photograph of a similar accident in 1936. When he came out of the chicane towards the pile-up, he was aware that the crowd looked somehow different – a different colour. He realized that they weren't looking at him but were facing in the other direction, and he was seeing the backs of their heads. Something ahead of him was interesting the crowd more than seeing Fangio coming towards them. He remembered seeing something similar in the photograph, braked hard, and stopped just short of the crash.

This must all have happened in a fraction of a second, when most drivers would have been using all their attentional resource to stay on the track at such blistering speed. But in that moment, Fangio was able to notice that something was wrong, process that information, and make sense of what he saw – all with time to do something about it. Afterwards, the laconic Fangio just said: ‘I was lucky.' But to me that isn't luck, it's adaptive expertise.

All this raises questions about the importance of doing time, and the experience of people like Joshua, Fabrice or me when we were starting out in our careers. From our perspective, we were just doing what we had to do, not engaging in sustained deliberate practice with the specific intention to improve, as Ericsson puts it. Our work was dictated by the environment we were in and the expectations of the people we were with. Nobody cared about our feelings or what we were learning. Yet whether we were aware of it or not, prolonged immersion in the work we had chosen allowed us to stock up an internal library of ‘doing' – a store of bodily knowledge that no amount of book-learning could have provided.

In the case of clinical medicine, book knowledge and ‘doing' are often out of sync. When I teach medical students how to take blood or suture a wound, they are often astonished at how troublesome they find it. High achievers throughout school and university, they are accustomed to mastering new knowledge without difficulty. But then they encounter these apparently simple physical tasks that lie outside their experience. That makes them feel like a five-year-old struggling to tie their shoelaces, and it comes as a shock. Unlike Joshua the tailor or Paul the stone carver, these students have not been working with materials and tools since day one. They lack the confidence that comes through continual exposure.

Knowing that it will take a long time to grasp such skills is helpful when we come to learn something new. It shows that doing time can't be bypassed. It shows that some skills can be unexpectedly elusive, taking much longer to master than you expect. And it shows why you sometimes get stuck.

那么，人是如何成为专家的呢？关于这个主题已经有了很多文献，许多研究者也提出了概念模型。有一个著名的模型描绘了四个阶段。该模型提出：

1、无意识的无能（unconscious incompetence）是指你连自己做不到某件事都不知道。

2、有意识的无能（conscious incompetence）是指你痛苦地意识到自己不太擅长这件事。

3、有意识的胜任（conscious competence）是指你集中精力就能做到这件事，但你必须想着自己正在做的事情。

4、无意识的胜任（unconscious competence）是最终阶段，即真正的专家达到了毫不费力的精通水准。

想一想学开车的经历，你就能理解这个模型了。你已经超越了初学开车的水平 —— 那时你不能协调地控制离合器与变速杆，不能一边打方向盘一边看后视镜；而现在，两个小时的车程之后，你回到家中时已记不起开车的具体细节，因为你一直在与乘客交谈。「驾驶」已经自动化了，成了自然而然的事情。

可这是怎么做到的呢？

K. 安德斯·埃里克森（K.Anders Ericsson）在专长的研究领域里很有影响力。如马尔科姆·格拉德威尔（MalcolmGladwell）这样的作者普及了埃里克森的毕生研究成果。几十年来，埃里克森一直在研究音乐、国际象棋和其他领域的「精英」，试图找出他们的秘诀。他的研究表明，所有成功的专家都在练习上至少投入了 10 年时间，或 1 万小时。这个神奇的数字已经成了至理名言，被流行文化奉为圭臬。但是，埃里克森的研究经常受到这样的误解：好像只要投入了这么多练习的时间，任何人都一定会成为专家。事实上，埃里克森的意思是，如果不做这样的积累，就没有人能成为专家 —— 并不是说投入 1 万小时就能保证成功。要成为专家，光靠练习是不够的。如果约书亚没有花那么多时间做袋盖，他就不会成为今天的裁缝大师。但是，如果他没有在这一技能的基础上继续进步，他只会擅长制作袋盖。现在他的工作已经远远超越了重复劳动所带来的技术熟练度。

埃里克森对练习的本质有着深刻的见解。许多人达到了他所说的「稳定表现渐近线」（stable performance asymptote）—— 水平高到足以做到他们想做的事，但不足以推动自己变得与众不同。这就好比任何网球达到业余水准的人，或者会开车的人。但是，埃里克森说，如果你想成为专家，只是重复做同样的事情是没有好处的。练习必须是持续的、刻意的，要有专家给予反馈，还要有改进的意愿。否则，你做的事情就只是一种任务或消遣。

还有些作者有不同的看法。我特别喜欢教育研究者卡尔·贝赖特（Carl Bereiter）和马琳·斯卡达玛利亚（MarleneScardamalia）提出的常规专长（routine expertise）和适应性专长（adaptive expertise）的概念。常规专长是指你学会了一种特定的做事方式，然后每次都按这种方式去做。对于重复的任务来说，如采血、制作袋盖或制作羽管键琴的琴键，这种专长很有用。你不希望每做一项简单的任务就发明一种新技术，或者在重复劳动上花费不必要的脑力。相反，你会擅长以一种特定的方式来做事，并将这项任务交给你的内部自动化系统来做。以学习开车为例，常规专长对于处理可预见的情况是很有效的。如果发生了意想不到的事情，困难就来了，因为这时你需要用另一种方式来思考。据说，心理学家亚伯拉罕·马斯洛（Abraham Maslow）曾说过：「如果锤子是你唯一的工具，你就很容易把所有东西都当作钉子。」你会根据已有的解决方案来看待新的问题。这可能会让你做出糟糕的决定。

与此不同，适应性专长是指提出新方法的能力。拥有适应性专长的人会刻意寻求新的挑战，把自己置于不舒服的境地，迫使自己用新的方式思考。一旦你变得擅长做某件曾经需要努力的事情，就能解放自己的头脑，而具有适应性的专家会利用这种解放出来的头脑来提高自己的技能。贝赖特和斯卡达玛利亚将这种行为称作「将腾出的注意力资源重新投入到高级的问题解决上去」。

回到开车的例子上，一个具有适应性的专家可能会把额外的注意力用于改进驾驶技术，如更好地观察路况、在雾天开车或在侧滑训练场练习安全驾驶，而不是与乘客交谈或听收音机。

我认为我们所有人都能发展常规专长和适应性专长，并在这两种专长之间切换。如果我们能做到这一点，结果可能会改变我们的人生。或者，在胡安·曼努纽尔·方吉奥（Juan Manuel Fangio）的例子里，能拯救生命。

1950 年，世界上出类拔萃的赛车手方吉奥参加了摩纳哥大奖赛。在比赛开始时，发生了连环相撞事故，此时方吉奥正领先一圈，以最高速度行驶。事故地点就在他的前方，但不在视线范围之内，就在下一个弯道后面。他似乎逃不过致命的车祸了。但是，方吉奥没有冲进相撞的赛车中间，他突然减慢了速度，在撞上车祸残骸之前停了下来。后来被问及此事时，他解释说，在准备比赛时，他一直在看一张 1936 年类似事故的照片。在驶出双急转弯，冲向车祸地点时，他意识到人群看起来有些异样 —— 颜色不一样了。他意识到观众不是在看他，而是面向另一个方向，他看到的是他们的后脑勺。与看见自己朝他们冲来相比，观众对他前方的某些东西更感兴趣。他记得在那张照片里看到了类似的现象，于是猛踩刹车，在快要撞上的时候停了下来。

这一切肯定都发生在几分之一秒内，而在如此惊人的速度下，大多数车手都会把所有的注意力资源放在使赛车待在赛道上。但在那一刻，方吉奥能够注意到有些不对劲，加工了这些信息，理解了看到的现象 —— 还有时间对此做出反应。事后，少言寡语的方吉奥只说了一句：「我很幸运。」但在我看来，这不是运气，而是适应性专长。

上述所有内容提出了一个问题：积累有多重要？像约书亚、法布里斯或我这样的人在职业生涯初期的经历有多重要？从我们的角度来看，我们只是在做必须做的事情，而不是像埃里克森所说，为了提高自己而进行持续的、刻意的练习。我们的工作是由我们所处的环境和身边的人的期望所决定的。没有人在乎我们的感受，或我们学到了什么。然而，不管我们是否意识到了这一点，长时间沉浸在我们所选择的工作中，让我们在脑海中积累了大量「做」的经验 —— 大量书本无法提供的身体知识。

就临床医学而言，书本知识与「做」往往是不同步的。在我教授医学生如何采血或缝合伤口时，他们常常惊讶地发现这有多么困难。他们在上学期间的成绩很优秀，习惯于毫不费力地掌握新知识。但他们随后会遇到这些看似简单的操作任务，而这些任务却超出了他们的经验范围。他们感觉自己像是在努力系鞋带的五岁孩子，这让他们很震惊。与裁缝约书亚或石匠保罗不同，这些学生从学习的第一天起就没有接触过工作对象与工具。他们缺乏通过持续的接触而产生的信心。

在我们开始学习新东西时，知道掌握这些技能要花很长时间是很有帮助的。这说明积累是不可回避的；有些技能可能出乎意料地难以掌握，需要花上比你预期更长的时间。这也说明为什么你有时会陷入困境。

### 3.7 改进的意愿

The intention to improve

When I was a GP, I learned to juggle. For several months, I went to lessons in a civic hall near my practice. Adrian, the teacher, was an inspiration. Tall, gangly and covered in tattoos, Adrian was one of the best performers in the UK, known at juggling conventions across the country for his superstar command of seven- and nine-ball patterns.

I started juggling with three balls. Learning this most basic of forms takes most people a few hours. Each ball goes from one hand to the other in what's supposed to be a graceful arc. It's frustrating at first, and you spend most of your time picking up balls. Eventually you get the hang of throwing one ball before you catch the previous one, and you develop a rhythm that becomes automatic. There are lots of variations which take ages to master, but the underlying idea is straightforward enough. I did a lot of practising, and soon I was able to keep a pattern going for as long as I wanted.

Naturally I wanted to move on, to develop my skills further. Four balls seemed the obvious next step, but juggling even numbers of balls is quite different from odd numbers. Instead of tossing each ball from one hand to the other, four-ball juggling consists of two independent patterns – one for each hand. When you throw two balls round in a circle with each hand at speed, it looks as if all four balls are crossing. In fact, they never do. I found this tricky, but after a few months I became able to do this too.

The crunch came with five balls. Because this is another odd-number pattern, each ball moves from hand to hand. It doesn't sound much more difficult than juggling three balls, but it is – by an order of magnitude. For a start, you have to be far more accurate in throwing and catching. You also have to throw all the balls high into the air in rapid succession, then start catching and throwing them again. I just couldn't do it. I practised for months and months, and to this day I've never cracked it. Even Adrian, who could juggle five balls in his sleep, didn't seem able to help. He tried approach after approach but I just couldn't get it. I was stuck at a threshold I couldn't cross, a barrier I couldn't push through.

Repetition is essential in any field, as we've seen. Doing time is necessary in order to progress, but on its own it's not enough – it's all too easy to tread water without moving forward. Once you've got the hang of an aspect of your work, whether taking blood, making pocket flaps or anything else, you have to push through an invisible barrier to reach the next level. This is what Ericsson means by sustained deliberate practice with the intention to improve .

Each time you come up against one of these invisible barriers and get through it, you move a little further along the path to becoming expert. Whenever that happens, you quickly focus on the new challenge and forget how hard you worked to get there. If it doesn't happen, you remain stuck, like me trying to juggle five balls.

If I'd wanted to become a professional like Adrian, I'd have found a way to push through that barrier. But for me, juggling was relaxation, not a career. Once I'd gained a reasonable proficiency, I never worked hard enough to move on to the next stage. I had reached Ericsson's ‘stable performance asymptote' and stayed there.

My work in medicine was different, however. Even though I found taking blood difficult, I was determined to keep going and master it. I kept practising, and in the end I got there.

在做全科医生的时候，我学会了杂耍。几个月来，我一直前往离我诊所不远的一个市民活动中心上课。那里的老师阿德里安很擅长激发大家的奇思妙想。阿德里安又高又瘦，身上满是文身。他是英国最好的杂耍艺人之一，曾在全国杂耍大会上大放异彩，轻而易举地完成了七球和九球模式的表演。

开始学习杂耍的时候，我是从三个球开始的。大多数人花几个小时就能学会这种最基本的技巧。每个球都要从一只手传递到另一只手，形成一个完美的弧线。刚开始时你会很沮丧，因为大部分时间都会用来捡球。渐渐地，你会掌握其中的诀窍，在接住球之前扔出另一个球，你会找到一种自动化的节奏。杂耍中有许多变化，需要花上很长时间才能掌握，但其基本概念却很简单。我做了大量练习，很快就能随心所欲地耍起来了。

当然，我想继续进步，进一步发展我的技能。很显然，下一步似乎该学四球模式了，但在杂耍中，奇数与偶数有很大的不同。不同于将每个球从一只手抛到另一只手上，四球杂耍由两种独立的模式组成 —— 每只手各有一种模式。当你用双手快速地把两个球绕圈抛起来的时候，四个球看起来好像在交错飞行。事实上，它们根本没有交叉。我觉得这很难，但在几个月后，我也学会了这套把戏。

真正的困难是五球模式。由于这是另一种奇数模式，每个球要从一只手移动到另一只手。听起来并不比抛接三个球难多少，但这其实更难 —— 难得多。首先，你在抛球和接球时必须更准确。你还必须把所有球连续、快速地高高抛起，然后接住并再次抛起。我就是学不会。我练习了好几个月，直到今天也没有成功。即使是阿德里安，这个能在睡梦中抛接五个球的人似乎也帮不了我。他试了一个又一个方法，但我就是学不会。我被一个无法跨越的门槛拦住了，这是一个我无法突破的障碍。

我们已经看到了，重复在任何领域都是必不可少的。为了进步，积累是必要的，但仅靠积累是不够的 —— 就像在游泳一样，我们很容易徒劳地踩水，却不能向前移动。一旦你掌握了工作的某一方面，无论是采血、制作袋盖还是其他事情，你都必须突破无形的障碍，才能达到下一个层次。这就是埃里克森所说的「持续、刻意的练习，再加上改进的意愿」。

每当你遇到这些无形的障碍并克服它们时，你就会在成为专家的路上走得更远。每当这种情况发生时，你很快就会把注意力集中在新的挑战上，忘记自己为达到目前的水平付出过多少努力。如果没有发生这种情况，你就会被困在原地，就像我试图抛接五个球一样。

如果我想成为阿德里安那样的专业人士，我就会找到突破障碍的方法。但对我来说，杂耍是放松，而不是职业。我达到一定程度的熟练水平以后，就没有再付出足够的努力，让自己达到下一个阶段了。我已经达到了埃里克森所说的「稳定表现渐近线」，并一直停留在那里。

然而，我在医学领域的工作却是不同的。尽管我觉得采血很难，但我还是决心继续努力并掌握这种技能。我坚持练习，最后达成了目标。

### 3.8 达成目标

Getting there

Back to Manchester in 1974. I'm struggling to put in an intravenous cannula and set up a drip on my emergency patient and I'm scared stiff. But that day I'm lucky. An experienced nurse helps me assemble the giving set and run through some fluid. My patient has veins that even a novice could find, and I strike gold at my first attempt. Blood flashes back, I slide the cannula into the patient's vein and the nurse helps me connect the tubing. ‘Thank you, Doctor,' the patient says gratefully. Being called ‘Doctor' when I'm just a student makes me feel proud, though also like an imposter.

Even my limited experience doing the bloods had allowed me to perform a different procedure on my first go, at short notice and in an emergency. That's what repetition makes possible. But whatever your area of activity, there's no shortcut to doing time. You can't cheat the clock. Knowing this can be helpful, because if you're slow it doesn't mean you're stupid. It's just that the skills of ‘doing' have different rules, and the kind of knowing that is required develops at a different speed from the knowledge of facts or figures. Remember, during those dark, dispiriting times when you seem to be standing still, that stuff is going on inside which will eventually come to fruition. You just have to keep going.

One afternoon over tea, I told an experienced doctor on my team how difficult I'd found my first round of doing the bloods. She looked at me blankly. She could no longer understand what it was like to flounder around with such an apparently simple task – simple, that is, to her. By then she had taken blood so often that it was second nature. She had made a transition and couldn't see the gulf I was facing. Some time later, the same thing started happening to me.

I got the hang of the bloods. I worked out a system for keeping track of my specimen bottles, lab forms, syringes and needles. I could put up drips and manage the kit. I was gaining confidence in approaching patients I'd never met, and I was coming to terms with causing a necessary discomfort. I'd begun to join a community of practice. I was even able to help a junior student myself, giving them tips about how to do what I'd once found so difficult. Already those difficulties were starting to blur and fade. I couldn't put myself back in their position because I'd moved forward. I'd taken a step along the journey to becoming expert.

I learned something else from doing the bloods, something even more important which I didn't notice at the time. While I was concentrating on getting round all those patients to take their blood before the lab closed, I wasn't only learning marksmanship with a syringe needle; I was learning to talk to people and to listen, to gain their trust and get them to let me into their personal space. I was learning to steel myself so I could carry on, even when I was causing pain and I knew that someone more experienced could have done it better. I was learning to relate to patients, to navigate the space between myself and another person – someone who was anxious, uncertain and vulnerable. In a nutshell, I was learning to become a doctor.

Becoming a doctor, a tailor or a hairstylist involves more than just learning skills. You have to start thinking like a doctor or a tailor or a hairstylist, and not just doing the things those people do. Something was changing inside me. When somebody called me ‘Doctor', I didn't feel sheepish. I turned around and asked, ‘How can I help?'

回到 1974 年的曼彻斯特。我正在艰难地给急诊患者插静脉滴注套管，吓得浑身僵硬。不过那一天我很幸运。一位经验丰富的护士帮助我安装好了整套设备，生理盐水流过了套管。这位患者的静脉即便是新手都能找到，我第一次尝试就成功了。

套管内有回血了，我将套管针插入了患者的静脉，护士帮我连接好了导管。「谢谢你，医生。」患者感激地说。对于还是学生的我来说，被称作「医生」让我感到自豪，但我同时觉得自己像个冒牌货。

虽然我有一些极为有限的采血经验，但我还是能在第一次尝试时就完成一套不同的操作，而且还是在紧急的、刚刚接到通知的情况下。这都是重复的功劳。无论在什么领域，积累的过程都是没有捷径的。你不能投机取巧。知道这一点很有帮助，因为学得慢并不意味着你很笨。这只是因为各种「做」的技巧有不同的规则，所需要的知识（无论是客观事实还是数据）的增长速度不同。记住，在那些最黑暗、最沮丧的时刻，当你似乎停滞不前的时候，内在的积累过程终有开花结果的一天。你只需要继续前进。

一天下午，我一边喝茶，一边告诉团队里的一个经验丰富的医生，我觉得第一次采血有多么困难。她茫然地看着我。她已经不理解为这种看似简单的任务手忙脚乱是什么感觉了 —— 准确地说，这种任务对她来说是简单的。那时，她已经做过无数次采血了，这已经成了她信手拈来的事情。她经历了一种转变，看不到我面临的鸿沟了。一段时间以后，同样的事情也开始发生在我身上。

我知道怎么采血了。我想出了一套方法来记住我的样本瓶、实验室表格、注射器和针头分别在哪儿。我能够完成输液和管理工具箱了。在接触从未见过的患者时，我越来越有自信，并且接受了我要给他们带来必要的不适感这件事。我开始加入实践社群了。我甚至能帮助没有经验的学生，告诉他们怎么做那些我曾经觉得很难的事。那些困难对我来说已经开始变得模糊起来，并逐渐消失了。我已经不能让自己回到他们的处境里了，因为我已经进步了。我在成为专家的旅程上向前迈进了一步。我从采血中还学到了一些别的东西，一些更重要的东西，尽管我当时没有意识到。我全神贯注地在患者之间奔忙，赶在实验室关闭前完成所有采血任务的时候，我不仅练就了用注射器扎针的准头，还学会了如何与人交谈，如何倾听，如何赢得他们的信任，让他们允许我进入他们的个人空间。即使我给他们造成了痛苦，即使我知道更有经验的人可能会做得更好，我也会鼓起勇气，坚定信念，这样我才能坚持下去。我学到了如何与患者相处，如何拿捏自己与对方之间的距离 —— 对面的这个人感到很焦虑、不确定、很脆弱。简而言之，我学会了如何成为一名医生。

成为医生、裁缝或发型设计师不仅需要学习技能。你必须开始像医生、裁缝或发型设计师那样思考，而不只是做他们做的事情。我的内心发生了一些变化。当有人叫我「医生」的时候，我不再感到羞怯。我会转过身来，问道：「我能为您做些什么？」

## 0401. 运用感官

0401 Using your senses

It's the middle of the night at Baragwanath Hospital in 1982. I'm ‘first call' for our surgical unit and I'm starting a laparotomy. My patient is Poppy. She's twenty-six years old and has typhoid. It's a terrible disease and it has punched holes in Poppy's intestine. Her whole system is septic and she's very sick. By this time I've done a lot of laparotomies, but I've never seen typhoid before. As soon as I make my first incision, I can see I might be in trouble. Poppy's abdominal cavity is full of pus, there are perforations in the gut, and intestinal contents are pouring out. Everything looks a mess and it smells terrible.

The textbooks make operating on perforated bowel sound pretty straightforward. You remove the diseased segment – ‘resect' it, in surgical terminology – then connect the ends to make a watertight join or anastomosis. To do this, you first decide how much you need to cut out, then you identify the arteries and veins which supply that segment. You clip, cut and tie the vessels and check there's no bleeding. Then you put clamps across the bowel, divide it with a scalpel, remove the diseased section, bring the remaining ends together and join them with needle and thread or a stapling device.

This, of course, makes it sound simpler than it really is. For one thing, you have to ensure that you've cut away just enough to reach healthy bowel and that the edges have a good blood supply. If you get this wrong, the join won't heal. It may even leak in the coming days, which can be disastrous. But it can be difficult to tell at the time whether the blood supply is good or not.

The problem with Poppy is that everything's wrong. Her abdominal organs don't look like anything I've seen before. I can't tell where diseased bowel stops and healthy bowel begins. Most of the patients I've been operating on are young, fit men who have been stabbed. Though there's serious damage, their organs are generally healthy. Typhoid changes all of that. My usual reference points have vanished and I'm in a bind.

Poppy's abdomen not only looks and feels different from what I've seen before; it behaves differently too. Typhoid gives human bowel the consistency of wet blotting paper. Every time I touch Poppy's intestine, it starts to fall apart. Though the anatomical structures are familiar, their materiality is weird. Too little tension on any join, and the anastomosis will leak; too tight, and the sutures will tear out. Each could have catastrophic consequences, so I have to get it just right. But how can I recognize what ‘just right' means? How much intestine should I remove? How hard can I pull it? What if handling it makes things worse? The usual cues no longer hold. I'm having to make judgements based on what I see, feel and smell; on things the textbooks can't tell you. I'm having to reconfigure what I thought I knew – and fast. The stakes are high and I'm terrified. How do I decide what to do?

By this time, I've got some way along my path towards becoming expert. I've been through the initial steps as an Apprentice – first as a doctor and now as a surgeon. I've struggled with knowing nothing and feeling out of my depth in everything I do. Now I'm building my internal library of sensations, and really getting to know my materials and tools. I've laid the groundwork through doing time. I've read books and watched other people. I've gained a sense of what normal organs look and feel like. I know a lot about what to do, but much less about how to do it. In this chapter, we'll explore what it means to acquire that knowledge of doing and what happens around its edges. Because now I'm at the limit of my experience. With Poppy, I'm in hostile territory.

那是 1982 年，在巴拉瓜纳医院里的一个深夜。我是我们外科做手术的「第一人选」，我正准备开始做剖腹术。我的患者叫波比。她当时 26 岁，得了伤寒。这是一种可怕的疾病，导致波比的肠子穿孔。她全身的系统都感染了，病得很重。那时，我已经做过很多次剖腹术了，但我从未见过伤寒。在切开第一道切口之后，我就知道我陷入麻烦了。波比的腹腔里满是脓液，肠道也有穿孔，肠道内容物正在大量排出。这一切看起来一团糟，味道极其难闻。

教科书把肠穿孔手术说得很简单。移除病变的部分（用外科术语说，就是「切除」），然后连接两端、缝紧，要滴水不漏（这也叫「吻合术」）。要做到这一点，首先要决定需要切除多少，然后找到为这部分肠子供血的动脉和静脉。夹住、剪开血管并打结，检查有没有出血。然后用夹子夹住肠子，用手术刀切开，取下病变部分，把剩下的肠子末端连在一起，用针线或缝合器固定。

当然，这段话让手术听起来比实际上更简单。举个例子，你必须确保你切除的部分刚好与健康的肠道相邻，并且切除的边缘有良好的血液供应。如果你弄错了，肠道的连接处就不会愈合，甚至可能在未来几天泄漏，这可能带来灾难性的后果。但是，在手术的时候很难判断血液供应是否良好。

波比的问题是，她的一切似乎都不对劲。她的腹腔器官和我以前见过的都不一样。我分不清哪里是病变的肠子，哪里是健康的肠子。被我动过手术的患者，大多数都是年轻力壮、被刺伤的男人。他们的器官虽然受到了严重的损伤，但总体上是健康的。伤寒改变了这一切。我通常的参照物都消失了，我陷入了困境。

波比的腹腔不仅看上去、摸上去不同于我以往的经验，其表现也不同。伤寒会让人的肠道变得像湿漉漉的吸水纸一样。我一触碰波比的肠子，肠子就会裂开。虽然腹腔里的结构是熟悉的，但质地却很奇怪。如果肠道缝合得不够紧，吻合处就会泄漏；如果缝得太紧，缝合线就会撕裂肠子。两种情况都会带来灾难性的后果，所以我必须做得恰到好处。但是，我怎么才能知道什么是「恰到好处」？我应该切除多少肠子？我能缝得多紧？如果我的处理让情况变得更糟了怎么办？通常的线索不再有效了。我必须根据我看到的、摸到的、闻到的东西做出判断。这些判断的依据是教科书无法告诉你的。我必须将我认为自己所知的东西重新组合起来 —— 而且要快。风险很高，我很害怕。我如何才能决定该怎么做？

彼时，我已经在成为专家的旅途上前进了一段路。我已经度过了作为学徒的初始阶段 —— 先是作为医生，现在是作为外科医生。无论我做什么，我都在「一无所知」和「力不从心」的感觉中挣扎。现在我正在建立自己内在的感觉库，并开始真正了解我的工作对象与工具。我已通过积累奠定了基础。我读过书，也观察过其他人。我知道正常的器官看上去的样子和摸上去的感觉。我清楚该做什么，但对于该怎么做，还了解得没那么多。在这一章里，我们会探索获取这种「做」的知识有何意义，以及当这种知识不够用时会发生什么。因为就在那时，我遇到了自己经验的极限。面对波比，我经受了严峻的考验。

### 4.1 你就是知道

‘You just know'

This tension between knowing what you should do and being able to do it is something that many experts describe. It's the same in the calmer world of wood engraving. Andrew Davidson has been an engraver for forty years. Wood engraving is centuries old, a combination of craftsmanship and art. When I visited Andrew in his home at the end of a rutted lane in England's rural Gloucestershire, he was finishing the illustrations for a Harry Potter book. I watched him incising a boxwood block, using engraving tools with names that go back hundreds of years. He laid out spitstickers, scorpers, burins and burnishers, like a surgeon's instruments. I heard the crunch as each tool bit into the smooth, hard wood. Andrew calls this ‘painting with light'. Even without looking he knows when the depth of each mark is right, because he can feel and hear it.

Then came the printing. Using a massive nineteenth-century cast-iron Albion press, Andrew arranged the engraved woodblock, face up. He squeezed black ink from a tube onto a flat stone block, then moved a miniature roller to and fro, coating its cylindrical surface with an even layer. Getting the right thickness of ink is crucial. Andrew judges this by ear, not by eye. ‘As you roll it over the stone, it should sound like the air going out of a Lilo,' he explained, ‘not like the sound of chips frying.'

Andrew inked the woodblock, placed a sheet of paper over it, then used the press's balanced handle to apply just the right amount of pressure for the right amount of time. He raised the handle, peeled off the paper and examined the result. Then he shook his head, inked the block again, put in a fresh sheet of paper and repeated the process until it was right.

Recognizing what's ‘right' has taken Andrew decades to learn. It's not something he can put into words because it's about sensation. He's not just using his hands, but ‘reading' the press with his whole body; responding to the feel, sound and smell of his materials. He knows exactly the amount of pressure to apply. But when he let me have a go, I felt clueless. I was just pulling a heavy lever, with no idea what I was aiming to achieve.

This multisensory awareness is what experts depend on. When you dissect the craft of any expert, you'll find something similar. Yet when you talk to these experts, they struggle to explain. They say things like, ‘Well, you just do what's right – you just know .' But unless you've spent the years they've spent doing it, you can't ‘just know'. And even then, you never really get there. Andrew explained it to me like this: ‘For more than forty years I've been trying to make the perfect print from a woodblock. I never have, and I know I never will. But I'll never stop trying.'

Andrew puts his finger on another important principle. His materials perform best at their limits, when they are stretched almost to breaking point. His finest work will often be at the edge of what his materials will tolerate, at the point of greatest risk – just as Poppy's gut required my best surgical effort. But how can you tell where the limit is? I found out more about that from another expert, this time in the field of ceramics.

许多专家都描述过这种「知道自己应该做什么」与「拥有做这件事的能力」之间的矛盾。在木版雕刻的宁静世界里也是如此。安德鲁·戴维森（Andrew Davidson）从事木版雕刻已经有 40 年了。木版雕刻有数百年的历史，是工艺与艺术的结合。安德鲁的家位于英格兰格洛斯特郡乡下的一条小巷尽头。这条小巷布满了车辙。我去拜访他的时候，他正要完成一卷《哈利·波特》（Harry Potter）的插图。我看着他切开一块黄杨木。

他使用的雕刻工具有着悠久的历史，它们的名称可以追溯到数百年前。他把尖凿、三角雕刀、手推雕刀、抛光器一字排开，就像外科医生用的器械一样。我能听到每件工具嵌进光滑坚硬的木头时发出的声音。安德鲁称这种过程为「用光线绘画」。即使不用眼睛看，他也能知道他雕刻的每个印记的深浅是合适的，因为他能感觉到，能听到。

接下来是印刷。安德鲁把雕好的木板放置在一台巨大的 19 世纪铸铁印刷机上，正面朝上。他把黑色的墨水从管子里挤到一块石板上，然后来回移动一个小型滚筒，在其圆柱体的表面上均匀地涂上一层墨水。墨水层的厚度合适是至关重要的。安德鲁是用耳朵而不是眼睛来判断的。「你把滚筒滚过石板的时候，它发出的声音应该像是空气从充气垫里钻出来一样，」他解释道，「而不是炸薯片的声音。」

安德鲁给木板涂上墨水，在上面放上一张纸，然后用印刷机的平衡手柄在适当的时长内，施加适当的压力。他抬起手柄，剥下纸张，检查印刷效果。然后他摇了摇头，又在木板上涂上墨水，放了一张新的纸上去，重复这个过程，直到结果令人满意为止。

安德鲁花了几十年的时间才弄清什么是「令人满意」。他无法用语言表达，因为这是一种感觉。他不仅在运用双手，更是在用整个身体「解读」印刷过程；他对工作对象的感觉、声音和气味做出了反应。他知道应该施加多大的压力。但当他让我试试的时候，我却感到不知所措。我只是在拉动沉重的手柄，却不知道我想要取得什么效果。

专家依赖的正是这种多感官的意识。分析任何专家的技艺，你都会发现类似的现象。然而，当你与这些专家交谈时，他们却很难解释清楚。他们会说：「这个嘛，你只要做正确的事情就好 —— 你就是知道。」但是，除非你也像他们一样花了多年时间来做这件事，否则你不可能「就是知道」。即便那样，你也永远不会真正达到理想中的境界。安德鲁是这样跟我解释的：「40 多年来，我一直在尝试用木板制作出完美的版画。我从来没做到过，我知道我永远也做不到，但我决不会停止安德鲁指出了另一个重要的原则。他的工作对象在极限状努力。」

态时呈现出的效果最好，也就是在几乎要断裂的时候。他最出色的作品往往产生于工作对象所能承受的极限，面临着极大的风险 —— 就像给波比的肠子动手术需要我使出浑身解数。可是你怎么知道极限在哪儿？关于这个问题，我从另一位专家那里了解到了更多，这次的专家来自陶艺领域。

### 4.2 处于崩溃边缘的工作对象

Thin materials on the verge of collapse

Duncan Hooson teaches pottery at several London art schools. He's a gifted tutor as well as an outstanding artist, and he's published a textbook on ceramics. Though some of his students are highly skilled, many are complete beginners. When I first met Duncan, we talked about how far you can push your materials before you go too far. Duncan calls this ‘working with thin materials on the verge of collapse'. It's a crucial skill for every expert, and it's what I struggled with as I operated on Poppy.

When you watch an expert like Duncan, his work looks effortless. First he ‘wedges' a lump of clay, thumping it like a baker working dough. Then he starts his potter's wheel and slaps the clay onto it. As the wheel picks up speed, he applies a little pressure here, a gentle finger there, and the clay morphs into the curved base of a vase. When he gets to the top of the vessel he draws out its neck by gently pinching the clay between his fingers. When the thickness is just right, he stops pinching. As simple as that.

But of course it isn't really simple at all. This pinching is a crucial operation. Not enough, and the neck stays lumpen and inelegant, too thick for the rest of the vase. Too much, and the clay collapses, unable to sustain its own weight. Then you have to start all over again. Duncan makes this look effortless, a wordless knowledge of just how far he can go. He has built up an awareness of what it feels like to be on the verge of collapse, a sensitivity that tells him when to stop and when to carry on a little further.

Duncan's work only looks effortless because of his decades of practice. Like the other experts in this book, he has been through years of doing time, making thousands of pots and vases. That was his equivalent of taking blood, making pocket flaps or creating flat stone surfaces. Most of his students haven't done that. They have to learn to notice when they're approaching a limit, to recognize that fine line between not far enough and too far. They have to learn to be attentive.

For Duncan, this is a bodily understanding. Potters do much of their work directly with their hands and fingers. Sometimes they use tools – for scraping, separating a pot from its base, inscribing patterns. But most of the time they are in an intimate, unmediated contact with their clay. They develop an exquisite sensitivity. It's this dialogue between Duncan's body and his materials that allows him to make continual adjustments. He may notice that his clay is too dry, too soft or too squidgy. This isn't something that can be defined. Unlike divisions on a ruler, there is no codified, objective ‘scale of squidginess'. Interpreting squidginess requires an internal library, stocked through constant practice.

But it's not only physical materials that can become thin, teetering on the verge of collapse. Whether you're drafting a report, managing conflict in your workplace, practising a piece of music or writing computer code, completion and collapse are never far apart. Too little, and it's not enough. A fraction further, and it's over the edge.

In surgery, this physical knowing is crucial. You learn to ‘read' the landscape you're working in, the organs you're touching. Like the sensation of the road when you're driving – mediated through the suspension of the car and felt through the seat of your pants – this is a combination of body and instruments. As a surgeon I developed similar skills to those Duncan uses when he is shaping the neck of a vase. You see with your fingers and your hands. You sense the squidginess directly. You gauge how springy and healthy an organ feels. You register when it's soggy and waterlogged, abnormally stiff, or overheated. You get a sinking feeling when an organ is starved of its blood supply and has the coldness of ischaemia. You feel the crackle of air in places it shouldn't be. You have a sense of how robust or vulnerable someone's tissue is. You develop an awareness of impending danger when you get too close to the limit.

I find this with words too. I spend a lot of time writing essays for journals and giving talks. There, too, is a fine line to tread. Too few words and it doesn't make sense. Too many and it becomes boring. At various points this book has behaved like a thin material on the verge of collapse. If I make a chapter too short or too long, or include too many examples, all of a sudden the whole thing falls apart. Success depends on recognizing the border, on having the skill to stop just before you cross it. Everyone I've spoken to finds parallels in their own lives – from thickening a sauce in the kitchen to taking the final millimetre off a wood carving. They are all developing their sense of where that verge of collapse lies.

邓肯·胡森（Duncan Hooson）在伦敦的几所艺术学校教授陶艺。他不仅是一位优秀的艺术家，也是一位有天赋的教师，他还出版了一本有关陶艺的教科书。虽然他的一些学生技术高超，但很多人都是初学者。初次遇见邓肯时，我们讨论了能够把工作对象驱使到什么程度而不至于过了头。邓肯说这就是「在崩溃的边缘处理脆弱的工作对象」。这是每个专家的关键技能，也是我在给波比动手术时的难点。

如果观察像邓肯这样的专家，你会发现他的工作似乎毫不费力。首先，他要「挤」出一块黏土，像面包师揉面团一样敲打黏土。然后，他转动陶轮，把黏土拍在轮上。随着陶轮的转速加快，他会在黏土某处施加一点压力，在另一处轻轻按下一根手指，黏土就会变成一个有弧线的花瓶底座。当他开始制作花瓶顶部时，他用手指轻轻捏住黏土，拉出花瓶的颈部。黏土厚度合适时，他就会松开手指。就这么简单。

当然，这一点都不简单。这个捏黏土的动作，是一项至关重要的操作。捏得力道不够，瓶颈就会粗大而不雅观，相对于花瓶的其余部分就显得太厚了。捏得太用力，黏土就会崩塌，无法承受自身的重量。这样你就得从头再来。邓肯让这一切看起来毫不费力。这是一种无言的知识：他知道自己能冒多大的风险。他已经拥有了一种意识：黏土濒临崩塌时会有什么感觉。这种敏感度会告诉他何时松开手指，何时再捏得薄一些。

邓肯的工作看起来毫不费力，是因为他练习了几十年。就像本书中的其他专家一样，他有多年的积累，制作了成千上万个陶罐和花瓶。这就相当于采血、制作袋盖或在石头上雕出平面。他的大多数学生都没有下过这个功夫。他们必须学会注意自己何时正在接近极限，意识到「不够」与「过头」之间的细微差别。他们必须学会专注。

对邓肯来说，这是一种身体上的理解。陶工的大部分工作都是直接用手和手指完成的。他们有时会用工具 —— 用来刮擦、将陶罐与底座分离、雕刻花纹。但大多数时候，他们会与自己的黏土亲密无间地接触。他们会发展出一种极为敏锐的感觉能力。正是邓肯的身体与工作对象之间的对话，使他能够不断地做出调整。他可能会注意到黏土太干、太软或太湿。这不是能清晰界定的标准。这不像尺子上的刻度，没有固定、客观的「湿软尺度」。分析湿软程度需要一种内部的感觉库，这种感觉库是通过不断练习而积累起来的。

并非只有有形的工作对象会变得「脆弱」，濒临崩溃。无论你是在起草一份报告、处理工作场合的冲突、练习一首曲子，还是在编写计算机代码，完成与崩溃总是近在咫尺。少则不足，在外科手术中，这种对有形事物的认识是至关重要的。你多则过度。

要学会「解读」你工作中的情况，你触摸的器官。这就像你在开车时对路况的感觉一样 —— 凭借自己的直觉，通过汽车的悬架感受路面。这是身体和工具的结合。作为外科医生，我发展出了类似邓肯在制作花瓶颈部时使用的技能。你要用你的手指和双手去感受。你能直接感受器官的湿软程度。你能估计器官的弹性与健康程度。如果器官是湿漉漉、异常僵硬或过热的，你就会注意到。如果器官缺乏血液供应，出现局部贫血的冰冷感，你就会有一种不安的感受。你能在不正常的地方感受到空气的噼啪声。你能感觉到一个人的组织有多强壮或多脆弱。在濒临极限的时候，你意识到即将到来的危险。

我发现文字上也有类似的现象。我花了很多时间为期刊写文章和做演讲。在那些事情上也有一条需要把握的界线。说得太少，词不达意；说得太多，则显得无聊。在不同的时刻，这本书就会显得像一种「脆弱」的工作对象，处于崩溃的边缘。

如果我把一章写得太短或太长，或者包含太多的例子，整本书就会突然崩溃。成功取决于看到边界，取决于有能力在越过边界之前停下来。与我交流过的每个专家都在自己的生活中发现了相似的情况 —— 无论是让厨房里的酱汁变稠，还是从木雕上再去掉最后一毫米的木料。他们都发展出了这样的意识：知道崩渍的边缘在哪里。

### 4.3 机械师的感觉

Mechanic's feel

In the operating theatre with Poppy I'm up against thin materials on the verge of collapse in surgery, though I didn't think of it in those terms at the time. I know the steps of the procedure I need to do and I've done it lots of times before. I know what organs should look and feel like, and I can find my way around a normal patient's abdomen blindfolded. But Poppy's intestines are like nothing I've ever encountered.

I haven't bargained for distorted materiality. Anatomy in a cadaver is one thing and anatomy in a living person is another, but the anatomy of disease is different again. I haven't yet developed enough experience to know how far to go, to understand what Poppy's intestine will permit me to do. If I don't cut out enough, she'll die of her disease. If I cut out too much, her digestive system won't be able to function. I need to find the point of imminent collapse, and walk up to the border without crossing it. How do I decide where that border lies? I run her intestine between my fingers, scrutinizing its colour and gauging its texture as I weigh up where to cut.

Recognizing the materiality of what you are working with is central to becoming expert. Robert Pirsig talks about this in his classic 1974 book Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance . He calls it ‘mechanic's feel'. He writes:

The mechanic's feel comes from a deep inner kinaesthetic feeling for the elasticity of materials. Some materials, like ceramics, have very little, so that when you thread a porcelain fitting you're very careful not to apply great pressures. Other materials, like steel, have tremendous elasticity, more than rubber, but in a range in which, unless you're working with large mechanical forces, the elasticity isn't apparent.

With nuts and bolts you're in the range of large mechanical forces and you should understand that within these ranges metals are elastic. When you take up a nut, there's a point called ‘finger-tight' where there's contact but no take-up of elasticity. Then there's ‘snug', in which the easy surface elasticity is taken up. Then there's a range called ‘tight', in which all the elasticity is taken up. The force required to reach these three points is different for each size of nut and bolt, and different for lubricated bolts and for locknuts. The forces are different for steel and cast iron and brass and aluminium and plastics and ceramics.

But a person with mechanic's feel knows when something's tight and stops. A person without it goes right on past and strips the threads or breaks the assembly.

All the experts I've talked to know about mechanic's feel, and the challenges of thin materials on the verge of collapse. Whether it's Derek the taxidermist skinning a baby vole, Andrew the engraver capturing the shimmer of twilight on a lake, or Joshua the tailor moulding the fall of a lapel, we all depend on what the books call ‘embodied knowing'.

In the operating theatre with Poppy and her typhoid perforations, I had to use all my mechanic's feel. I readjusted my sense of how hard I could pull and how much tension I could place on her fragile intestines. Gingerly, I tried to isolate a segment of bowel using my usual technique. It came to pieces in my hand. I realized I'd have to be much more careful. I liked to think I was a gentle surgeon, but I had to recalibrate. I couldn't afford to make things worse.

One of the reasons it takes so long to become expert is that you have to become familiar with variation, not just an ‘ideal' state. You have to deal with materials that are old, fragile, recalcitrant, unpleasant to touch, smelly or even dangerous. When I was operating on Poppy I was dealing with familiar materials in an unfamiliar state, like the rusted-up screws or corroded components of a motorcycle. I had to widen my sense of mechanic's feel to account for departures from the norm.

As you struggle with the basics – taking blood without getting your specimens jumbled up; inking a woodblock without causing a blot – you gradually become accustomed to the physicality of your work. With time, that work becomes less a matter of conscious attention and more a matter of routine. Your fingers stop being so clumsy, your materials don't seem so intransigent. You become increasingly aware of the intersection between you and what you're doing. This feeling doesn't reside wholly in you or your materials; it's a dialogue.

在给波比做手术的时候，我面对的是在手术中濒临崩溃的脆弱工作对象，不过我当时并没有用这样的方式来思考。我知道我需要完成的步骤，我以前做过很多次手术。我知道器官应有的样子和触感，我蒙着眼睛都能对正常人的腹腔了如指掌，但是我从没见过像波比这样的肠子。

我从没有准备好面对这种怪异的物质属性。解剖尸体是一回事，解剖活人是另一回事，但解剖病变的组织则完全不同。我还没有足够的经验去知道应该冒多大的风险，去知晓波比的肠子能允许我做什么。如果我切除的不够多，她会死于疾病。如果我切得太多，她的消化系统就不能正常工作。我需要找到濒临崩溃的边缘，然后走到边界而不越雷池一步。我该如何判断边界在哪儿？我用手指顺着她的肠子摸索，仔细观察肠子的颜色，估计肠子的质地，掂量在哪里下刀。

认识自己工作对象的物质属性，是成为专家的关键。罗伯特·波西格（Robert Pirsig）在他 1974 年出版的经典著作《禅与摩托车维修艺术》 （Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance）中谈到了这一点。他把这种认识称作「机械师的感觉」。他写道：

机械师的感觉来自对材料弹性的一种深层的内在动觉。有些材料，比如陶瓷，其弹性很小，所以你在处理陶瓷时要非常小心，不要施加太大的压力。还有些材料，比如钢铁，其弹性就很大，比橡胶还大。但是在一定的情况下，这种弹性是看不出来的，除非你有了螺母和螺栓，你就能施加很大的机械力，你施加很大的机械力。

就应该知道，在这种受力范围内，金属是有弹性的。拧螺母的时候，有一种松紧程度叫「手指拧紧的程度」（finger-tight），此时螺母与金属表面接触，但没有产生弹性。还有一种程度叫「恰到好处」（snug），此时产生了容易产生的表面弹性。还有一种程度被称为「紧」（tight），此时金属的所有弹性都已经耗尽了。达到这三种程度所需的力因螺母和螺栓的大小而不同，对于润滑过的螺栓和锁紧螺母也是不同的。这种所需的力，对于钢、铸铁、黄铜、铝、塑料和陶瓷也都是不同的。

但是，一个人如果有机械师的感觉，他就知道螺母什么时候拧紧了，应该停下来。没有这种感觉的人就会拧过头，导致螺母滑丝，或者把装置弄坏。

与我交谈过的所有专家都知道这种「机械师的感觉」，也知道脆弱的工作对象处于崩溃边缘的挑战。无论是给田鼠幼崽剥皮的标本剥制师德里克，描绘黄昏湖面微光的木版雕刻师安德鲁，还是给西装驳头定型的裁缝约书亚，我们都依赖于许多书中所说的「具身知识」（embodied knowing）。

在手术室里，面对波比和她的肠伤寒穿孔，我不得不用上我全部的「机械师的感觉」。我重新调整了自己的感官，估计了我能用多大的力气牵拉，我能给她脆弱的肠子施加多大的力度。

我小心翼翼地试图用我惯用的方法把一截肠子挑出来。肠子在我的手里四分五裂。我意识到我得更加小心。我倾向于认为自己是一个手法温柔的外科医生，但我必须重新调整自己的力道。我不能让事情变得更糟了。

花这么长的时间才能成为专家的原因之一是，你必须熟悉变化，而不只是熟悉一种「理想」的状态。你必须处理那些陈旧的、易碎的、棘手的、摸上去不舒服的、难闻的甚至危险的工作对象。我在给波比做手术时，我处理的就是一种在陌生状态下的熟悉对象，就像生锈的螺丝或被腐蚀的摩托车部件。我必须拓展自己「机械师的感觉」，来理解那些偏离常规的现象。当你在最基本的工作中挣扎时 —— 比如在不弄混样本的情况下采血，在不留下污点的情况下给木板涂墨水时，你会逐渐熟悉工作中的物质特性。随着时间的推移，工作不再需要有意识的关注，而会成为一种例行事务。你的手指不会再那么笨拙，你的工作对象也不会再那么不听使唤。你会越来越意识到你和你正在做的事情之间的交流。这种感觉不完全存在于你或你的工作对象之中，这是一种对话。

### 4.4 感官的语言

The language of the senses

We hardly ever use just one sense at a time. And while we think of touch, sight, hearing, smell and taste as if those ‘Aristotelian five' were the only senses we have, neuroscientists and philosophers talk of a multitude of senses – perhaps as many as twenty-five. They distinguish between exteroception (recognizing information that comes from outside the body) and interoception (information from the body itself, about balance, orientation, or the hidden workings of our physiology). Becoming an expert requires integration between these outer and inner worlds. Sensory engagement is what turns looking into seeing, listening into hearing, touching into feeling, sniffing into smelling and tasting into savouring. Yet the information we get from our senses is not fixed. It can be shaped by our mental and physical state – by excitement, tiredness, hunger or stress.

Even thinking about the Aristotelian five, traditional distinctions between modalities are not clear-cut. We may not experience synaesthesia in a formal way, but our senses still cross over. As a surgeon I learned to see with my fingers. With my hands deep inside someone's abdominal cavity, I would build a picture of that patient's organs, learning to recognize what felt right and what felt wrong in territories of the body I could touch but couldn't see. This happens with all kinds of materials. Not only are silk and flannel different from one another, but each piece of silk has its idiosyncrasies and so does each piece of flannel. A novel isn't the same as a PhD thesis, though they are both book-length pieces of writing.

Each sense has its own characteristics too. Touch, for instance, has an immediacy that vision and hearing lack. Looking and hearing are sometimes described as ‘distal' senses. If someone is out there and you see them, they don't necessarily see you. It's the same with hearing. But touch is ‘proximal'. If you feel something, it ‘feels' you, because you're in direct contact. It responds to your touch, even if it's inanimate. In medicine, this is especially obvious. You can't examine a conscious patient without them being aware of you touching them. It's the same whenever your work involves other people. You are conveying information at the same time as receiving it, whether you realize that or not. Even as an apprentice, Fabrice the hairstylist was conveying information about himself every time he washed a client's hair and touched their scalp.

Noticing your materials requires you to ‘tune in' to your senses. This takes practice. It's easy to block out sensory information, to look without seeing, hear without listening and touch without feeling. Noticing means being present, being attentive . At the same time, you must be aware of the intersection between your materials and yourself. Experts do more than notice. They interpret and make sense. They respond to what they perceive. They act.

The philosopher Martin Heidegger captured this elegantly in one of his late lectures:

A cabinetmaker's apprentice, someone who is learning to build cabinets and the like, will serve as an example. His learning is not mere practice, to gain facility in the use of tools. Nor does he merely gather knowledge about the customary forms of the things he is to build. If he is to become a true cabinetmaker, he makes himself answer and respond above all to the different kinds of wood and to the shapes slumbering within wood – to wood as it enters into man's dwelling with all the hidden riches of its nature. In fact, this relatedness to wood is what maintains the whole craft.

The same applies to whatever area of work you are becoming expert in. Heidegger's ‘relatedness to wood' applies equally to cloth, hair or boilers. You have to become connected to the materials you work with, attending to their subtleties and nuance.

It's the same with surgery. Living organs are not inert like those in the dissecting room; they have their own characteristics and personality. Nothing keeps still. The ureter ‘vermiculates' if you prod it, moving like an earthworm. Healthy intestines writhe. Bowel is not just bowel, any more than cloth is just cloth, or stone is just stone. The small intestine of a healthy twenty-year-old involved in a car accident is very different from that of a fragile ninety-year-old with diabetes, let alone a patient like Poppy.

Over time, you get to know the ways of your materials. You develop respect and affection for them, even when you find them frustrating. But, as we've seen, just doing things over and over again is not enough. Duncan Hooson's ability as a potter is not based on repetition alone. It's what the repetition has led to that counts. He's developed a sensitivity, an ability to ‘read' what is happening between his fingers, his body at the potter's wheel and the clay he's shaping. He's gained an ability to recognize early signals of imminent collapse and take action while there's still time. He does this by attending to his physical world, by being present.

In whatever it is that you do, there are analogues to Duncan's fingers, his body at the wheel and the clay he's shaping. To improve, and later to become expert, you must develop the ability to maintain presence, even when your materials seem to be falling apart around you. Nobody can fully convey what something feels like when you touch it; you have to experience it for yourself. Textbook descriptions are largely useless – words alone can't capture when something is ‘just right'. In surgery they say things like ‘ensure that the anastomosis is under the minimum tension possible' or ‘remove as much as necessary but no more than is required'. Unless you have a lot of experience, this gets you nowhere. It only makes sense if you already know what it means. And that knowledge comes through doing, through experiencing the sensations of materiality and by getting it wrong.

That's what tells you when you're dealing with thin materials on the verge of collapse.

我们很少一次只使用一种感官。在我们看来，触觉、视觉、听觉、嗅觉和味觉 —— 亚里士多德所说的「五感」似乎是我们仅有的感官，但神经科学家和哲学家会谈到许多感官 —— 也许多达 25 种。他们区分了外感觉（识别来自身体外部的信息）和内感觉（识别来自身体本身的信息，即关于平衡、定向或我们生理机能的隐秘运作的信息）。成为专家需要将这些外部世界和内部世界结合起来。感官参与就是把「看」变成「看见」，把「听」变成「听见」，把「摸」变成「触感」，把「闻」变成「闻到」，把「尝」变成「品味」。然而我们从感官获得的信息并不是固定的。这些信息会受到我们的精神和身体状态的影响 —— 受到兴奋、疲劳、饥饿或压力的影响。

即便对于亚里士多德的五感来说，这些感觉形态之间的传统区分也不清晰。我们可能不会感觉到明确的通感，但我们的感觉依然会有交叉。作为一名外科医生，我学会了用手指看东西。当我把手伸进一个人的腹腔时，我脑海中就会产生一幅关于患者器官的图案。对于那些我能摸到但看不到的身体部位，我逐渐学会了分辨哪些感觉是正常的，哪些是异常的。这种现象会发生在所有的工作对象上。不仅丝绸和法兰绒是不同的，每一匹丝绸都有独特之处，法兰绒也是如此。小说与博士论文虽然都像一本书那么长，但两者并不相同。

每种感官都有自己的特点。例如，触觉具有视觉和听觉缺乏的直观。看和听有时会被称为「远」感官。如果有人在远处，你能看见他们，他们不一定能看见你。听觉也是如此。但是触觉是「近」的。如果你摸到某物，它也会「感觉」到你，因为你们有直接的接触。即使这件物体没有生命，它也会对你的触摸产生反应。在医学领域，这一点尤其明显。对于清醒的患者来说，你不可能在不让他们意识到你的触碰的情况下给他们做检查。如果你的工作涉及其他人，情况也是如此。不管你是否意识到了，你在传达信息的同时也在接收信息。即便是学徒时期的发型设计师法布里斯，每次在给客户洗头、触摸他们的头皮时，他都在传达关于自己的信息。

要注意你的工作对象，就需要你「收听」自己的感官。这需要练习。我们很容易屏蔽感觉信息，视而不见、充耳不闻、触而不感。注意意味着处在当下，意味着专注。与此同时，你必须意识到你的工作对象与你的交流。专家做的不仅仅是注意。他们还会解读与理解。他们会对自己的感知做出反应。他们会行动。

哲学家马丁·海德格尔（Martin Heidegger）在他晚年的一次演讲中巧妙地阐明了这一点：

一位正在学习制作橱柜等家具的家具木工，就是一个很好的例子。他的学习不仅仅是练习，以掌握工具的使用方法。他也不仅仅是在收集有关他要制造的事物的常见形态的知识。如果他想成为一名真正的家具木工，他首先要让自己与各种不同的木材，与木材中尚未被雕刻出来的形状进行交流 —— 与木材进入人类居所时所隐含的丰富可能性进行交流。事实上，这种与木材的联系才是这门手艺的支柱。

同样的道理也适用于你要成为专家的任何领域。海德格尔所说的「与木材的联系」同样适用于布料、头发或锅炉。你必须与自己的工作对象建立联系，注意它们的微妙之处和细微变化。

外科手术也是如此。活的器官不像解剖室里的器官那样死气沉沉，它们有自己的特点与个性。没有一种器官会保持静止。如果你戳输尿管，它就会像蚯蚓一样蠕动。健康的肠道会扭动。肠子不仅仅是肠子，就像布料不仅仅是布料，石头不仅仅是石头。一个遭遇车祸的 20 岁年轻人的小肠，与脆弱的 90 岁糖尿病患者的小肠截然不同，更不用说像波比这样的患者了。

随着时间的推移，你会逐渐了解自己的工作对象。你会对它们产生敬意和感情，即使在你觉得它们令人沮丧的时候。但是，正如我们所见，只是一遍又一遍地重复做事是不够的。邓肯·胡森作为陶艺师的能力并非仅建立在重复的基础上。重复的结果才是最重要的。他发展出了一种敏锐的感知，一种能力，使他能「读懂」他的手指之间、陶轮旁的身体与他正在塑造的黏土之间所发生的事情。他获得了一种能力，能够识别工作对象即将崩溃的早期信号，并及时采取行动。他能做到这一点，是因为他关注自己的物质世界，专注于此时此地。

无论你做的是什么，都存在类似邓肯的手指、他在陶轮旁的身体，以及他所塑造的黏土一样的东西。为了进步，并在之后成为专家，你必须培养一种专注于此时此地的能力，即使在你的工作对象似乎要分崩离析的时候也要如此。没有人能充分传达触摸某物的感觉，你必须亲身体验。教科书里的描述在很大程度上是无用的 —— 单凭文字无法说清某件事如何做得「恰到好处」。在外科手术里，大家会说「确保吻合处所受的张力尽可能小」或「尽量多地移除需要移除的部分，但不要超过必要的程度」这样的话。除非你有很多经验，否则这种话对你毫无帮助。只有你知道这是什么意思，这种话才有意义。这种知识源于实践，源于体验物质属性带来的感觉，源于犯错。

只有这种知识能告诉你，脆弱的工作对象何时处于崩溃的边缘。

### 4.5 倾听你的身体

Listening to your body

When I was operating for long hours at a stretch, working through the night with patients who had been stabbed and shot, I'd notice myself becoming clumsy. Instruments wouldn't do what I wanted, needles would slip out of my grasp, and I started dropping swabs. At first this just made me irritated with myself. Later, I learned to recognize that irritation as a marker of fatigue, a signal that I needed a break. I didn't actually feel tired, because of the adrenaline rush which emergency surgery creates, but my performance was starting to degrade.

Experts become adept at reading their own bodies as well as the materials they work with. They notice, interpret and act on small signals that their concentration is starting to lapse. They register when they themselves are becoming thin materials on the verge of collapse.

This doesn't only happen in the operating theatre. Like many people, I write on a computer. For years I've done this almost without thinking, the keys an extension of my fingers. But it wasn't always like that. When I was a teenager, my parents made me go on a two-week course in touch-typing. This was the era of mechanical typewriters, before word processors had arrived on the scene. At that time, typing was usually done by professionals, who had been on courses lasting a year or two. Programmes like that involved endless practice, bashing out boring exercises week after week and doing speed tests. My course was quite different. It consisted of ten one-hour sessions, one each weekday for a fortnight, and that was it. No preparation, no practising between sessions, no homework. That's why I agreed to do it.

Every day I sat in a class of twenty people, each of us in front of a typewriter with blanked-out keys so there was no temptation to look at our hands. The ‘home keys' were red and that's where our fingers needed to hover, returning each time after reaching out to press a letter. All the other keys were grey. A similar keyboard was projected on a huge screen at the front. During the lessons a pre-recorded voice would intone letters in a slow monotonous rhythm, at two-second intervals. Each letter's key would light up on the screen, and we would have to press the corresponding key on our own machine. As the lessons went on the speed increased, moving from random letters to simple words. By the end of the course, I could type at a respectable speed, with a steady rhythm and without looking at the keyboard at all. It was one of the most useful things I ever learned.

Later, though, I realized that my accuracy and speed were not constant. They varied with how I was feeling. When I was tired, I would make unforced errors and have to go back and erase them with correcting fluid. That took a long time and interrupted my flow. I became irritated with myself and the typewriter, and things would go downhill. As I discovered later in the operating theatre, that irritation was telling me I needed to stop. Yet this capacity to ‘read' my body took a long time to develop. Even now when I'm writing it takes me a while to recognize the signals. My concentration is a thin material on the verge of collapse; sometimes I need to take a break.

Pirsig says something similar in Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance when he describes hiking in a canyon in Montana with his son Chris as they're both getting very tired. ‘By about three in the afternoon,' he writes, ‘my legs start to get rubbery and it's time to stop. I'm not in very good shape. If you go on after that rubbery feeling you start to pull muscles and the next day is agony.' Pirsig has an awareness of his own body in that context and makes decisions accordingly.

Experts develop an internal instrument panel that allows them to monitor what is happening at that nexus between hands, tools and materials. They know when to push on and when to take a break. Anyone who has spent time learning a skill will be familiar with that experience. As I've spent time with experts in different fields, I've kept hearing the same story. They've all developed a relationship with the materials and tools they work with. Everything has ‘materiality', the physical characteristics that determine its behaviour. Becoming expert involves recognizing the subtleties of this material world.

By spending time with materials, you come to understand their nature and learn about your own. As I've pointed out in my example of typing, even apparently abstract activities like writing have a strong physical element. If you focus your attention on your body, you become aware of the feel of the pen in your hand, the texture of the paper you're writing on, or irregularities in the computer keyboard under your fingertips and the click of the keys as you type. Yet in descriptions of expert practice, the senses of touch, hearing and smell are often overlooked.

Developing this awareness is a long process and there are no shortcuts. Through familiarity, however, you will begin to understand how far you can push things and when you need to back off. Gaining fluency in the language of your senses is the next step on the path to becoming expert.

当我连续长时间地手术，整夜为被刺伤或枪击的患者忙碌时，我发现自己会变得笨拙起来。器械会不听使唤，针头会滑落，我会开始拿不稳棉签。一开始，这种情况会让我对自己很恼火。后来，我意识到，这种恼火是疲劳的标志，是我需要休息的信号。因为紧急手术带来肾上腺素飙升，所以我其实并不觉得累，但我的水平开始下降。

专家会变得善于读懂自己的身体，就像善于读懂自己的工作对象一样。他们会注意到自己的注意力开始涣散的细微迹象，并采取行动。当自己变得像脆弱的、处于崩溃边缘的工作对象时，他们也会发现。

这种事不只是会发生在手术室里。像许多人一样，我也在电脑上写作。多年以来，我写作时几乎不假思索，键盘就像我手指的延伸一样。但是情况并非总是如此。我十几岁的时候，父母曾让我参加一门为期两周的盲打课。那是机械打字机的时代，文字处理软件还没有出现。当时，打字通常是由专业人士完成的，他们要上一到两年的课程。像这样的课程会要求你无休止地练习，一周又一周地进行无聊的练习，还要做速度测试。我上的课程很不一样。这门课包含 10 节 1 小时的课程，每个工作日上一节课，总共上两周，仅此而已。不需要准备，不需要在课程间隙练习，没有作业。所以我才同意去上课。

每天，我坐在一个 20 人的教室里。每个人面前都有一台打字机，打字机的按键是空白的，这样我们就不会忍不住低头看手。「起始键」是红色的，我们的手指需要停留在这个键的上方，每次按下一个字母后都要把手指放回来。其他按键都是灰色的。

教室前方的大屏幕上有一个类似的键盘投影。上课时，预先录好的语音会以缓慢单调的节奏念字母，每两个字母间隔两秒。每个字母的按键会在屏幕上亮起来，而我们必须在自己的打字机上按下相应的键。随着课程的进行，语音的速度会逐渐加快，从随机的字母到简单的单词。到课程结束时，我已经可以用相当快的速度和稳定的节奏打字了，而且根本不用看键盘。这是我学到的最有用的东西之一。

不过，我后来意识到，我的准确性和速度不是恒定的。它们会随我的感受而变化。我疲惫时，就会出现一些失误，然后不得不回过头去用修正液涂掉。这会花很长时间，并打断我的思路。我开始对自己和打字机感到恼火，情况会越来越糟。后来我在手术室里发现，这种恼火告诉我需要停下。然而，这种「读懂」身体的能力花了很长时间才形成。即使是现在写作的时候，我也需要一些时间才能识别这些信号。我的注意力是处于崩溃边缘的脆弱工作对象，有时我需要休息一下。

在《禅与摩托车维修艺术》一书中，波西格描述自己与儿子克里斯在蒙大拿州的峡谷里徒步旅行的经历时说过类似的话。

「下午三点左右，」他写道，「我的腿开始乏力，是时候停下来了。我的状态不是很好。如果你忍着这种乏力的感觉继续前行，你的肌肉就会拉伤，第二天就会很痛苦。」波西格能在那种情况下觉察自己的身体，做出相应的决定。

专家会发展出一种内部的仪表盘，使他们能够监控双手、工具和工作对象之间发生了什么。他们知道何时应该坚持，何时应该休息。任何花时间学习技能的人都会熟悉这种感觉。随着我与不同领域的专家相处，我不断听到同样的话。他们都与自己的工作对象和工具建立了一种关系。每种事物都有「物质属性」，也就是决定其行为表现的物质特性。成为专家需要认识这个物质世界的微妙之处。

通过花时间处理工作对象，你会逐渐了解它们和自己的本质。正如我在学打字的例子里指出的那样，即使像写作这样明显抽象的活动也有很多物质性的元素。如果你把注意力集中在自己的身体上，你就会意识到笔握在手中的感觉，你正在书写的纸张的质地，或者指下的电脑键盘的不规则排列，以及打字时敲击键盘的咔咔声。

培养这种意识是一个漫长的过程，没有捷径可走。然而，通过熟悉你的工作，你会开始理解你能坚持到什么程度，以及何时应该后退。在你成为专家的路上，下一步就是熟悉感官的语言。

### 4.6「看」与「看见」的区别

The difference between looking and seeing

As a trainee surgeon, I remember assisting my consultant in an elective parathyroidectomy – an operation to remove the parathyroid glands. These are curious structures, usually (though not always) found in the neck. I'd learned about them when studying anatomy, but never seen them in real life. They are called parathyroids because they commonly sit alongside the thyroid gland, but functionally they have nothing to do with it. Instead they produce a hormone for regulating calcium metabolism. Sometimes they go wrong and have to be removed. Usually there are four of these small pinkish structures, but they are notorious for being variable in size, number and position, and for being difficult to recognize during surgery.

My chief made an incision into the patient's neck, then began exploring the complex anatomy underneath. The neck is full of delicate structures which have to be peeled apart, making sure that tiny nerve twigs are preserved. He was a taciturn surgeon and didn't explain what he was doing, but after a while he grunted, ‘There they are, see?' and carried on dissecting. I had no idea what he was talking about. I couldn't see anything remotely resembling a parathyroid. But I didn't want to seem ignorant, so I kept quiet. After what seemed like a long time, I suddenly saw what he was working on: small clumps of tissue I had completely missed. Despite learning the anatomy from textbooks, teaching it to medical students in the dissecting room and having operated on a lot of necks myself, I hadn't seen what was right in front of me.

Looking – really looking – requires a lot of effort. It doesn't just happen when you open your eyes and point them at something. It's an active process that demands your full attention. For many of us, this kind of looking doesn't come naturally; it's a skill that has to be nurtured. Noticing what is really there, rather than what you expect to see, demands a relaxed eye, lots of time and infinite patience.

As a medical student I was taught how to carry out a physical examination; I memorized a sequence. First you look, then you touch, and only then do you listen with your stethoscope. ‘Inspection, palpation, percussion, auscultation', the textbooks called it. Whatever the patient's symptoms, the mantra never varied. Your consultant would pillory you if you failed to do things in the right order, if you left out a step or brought out your stethoscope too soon. The cornerstone was using your eyes: really looking.

I learned to demonstrate that I was looking by ostentatiously standing away from the patient's bedside, hands behind my back, and describing what I saw according to a formula. ‘The patient is a well-nourished man of seventy, lying quietly with no evident distress. Fingers show no evidence of clubbing, tremor or splinter haemorrhages. The accessory muscles of respiration are not in use …' Only after reciting a checklist of physical observations could I move on to palpation, to touching the patient, putting my hand on their chest, abdomen or limbs. Even then I was taught always to look at the patient's face while I was touching them, alert for tiny signals that I might be causing pain or discomfort.

I didn't understand the value of this discipline when it was being dinned into me. It seemed a waste of time. Surely if a patient had abdominal pain, you needed to put your hand on their abdomen to find out if they were tender, not spend ages looking at their face to see if their lips were blue. After all, that's how the doctors I was working with did it. They cut to the chase. They palpated the patient's abdomen and put their stethoscope onto the chest straight away. Or so it seemed.

In reality, these experienced clinicians had made observations first, but so rapidly that I hadn't spotted them doing it. Almost always they noticed more than I did. When they asked me to present a patient, they'd say things like ‘And what about the asymmetry of this patient's fingernails?' or ‘Why do you think his breathing is uneven?' – things I hadn't even registered. They would put these clues together to make a diagnostic story.

Eventually, I realized that this discipline of observation was essential. Seeing the patient as a person – rather than narrowing my focus down to one area of their body – stopped me jumping to conclusions. It was about learning to see . That was the difference between me and my consultant during the parathyroid operation. He had learned to look in a way that I hadn't. I had no reference points and I hadn't ‘tuned in' my eyes. I had never seen the parathyroids in a living patient and I didn't yet know what to look for.

For experienced clinicians, attentive looking has become second nature. Yet this process can unravel under stress. Every year at my university I'm an examiner for the medical students' finals, the last stage before they qualify as doctors. I watch the students physically examining patients and demonstrating the sequence they've been taught. Inspection, palpation, percussion, auscultation. They look, they touch, they listen. Then they make sense of the information they've gathered and present their conclusions. That's the theory, anyway.

One year, after watching a student peer at the patient, then feel her pulse while looking at his watch, I asked him what he was doing. ‘Measuring the pulse rate,' he replied. ‘And what is it?' I asked. First he looked nonplussed, then aghast. He picked up the patient's wrist and started counting again. In the stress of the moment he had gone through the motions, but that was all. He had demonstrated the procedure he'd been taught, but hadn't engaged his brain or processed the information he'd gathered. He had looked without seeing, touched without feeling, felt the pulse without considering what it meant for that patient.

There's much less emphasis now on looking and touching in medicine. In the decades since I was a medical student, imaging technology has revolutionized clinical practice. Ultrasound, CT, MRI and PET scans show internal anatomy with astonishing precision. In many ways that's a huge improvement, providing detail that would have been unimaginable even a few years ago. But while it's tempting to farm out the looking to specialist radiologists trained to interpret images, there's a danger of losing touch with your patients, of missing the wider picture for each unique person. I've noticed this problem in many other fields of expertise. Relying too much on technology can blunt your senses, preventing you from seeing what's under your nose or responding to the individual you're with.

There's real value in the drill of slowing down and being systematic. Perhaps because we use our vision all the time, it's easy to take it for granted, to think that by glancing we have really seen. The term ‘inspection' gives an identity to attentive looking, and frames it as an act that has to be performed deliberately.

Yet at an early stage in your career, there are dangers within an atomized approach. You can believe that going through the motions is the same as having grasped the point. This is the seductive effect of learning components without understanding the whole picture. Once you can make a good pocket flap or cut a straight fringe, you might believe that you know more than you do about making jackets or styling hair. You become overconfident, and sooner or later you come a cropper.

我还记得，在做实习外科医生的时候，我曾协助我的顾问医师做过一次选择性甲状旁腺切除术 —— 这是一种切除甲状旁腺的手术。这些奇妙的组织结构通常（并不总是）位于颈部。我在学习解剖学时学过甲状旁腺，但从未在现实中见过。它们之所以叫甲状旁腺，是因为它们通常位于甲状腺旁边，但在功能上与甲状腺无关。它们会产生一种调节钙代谢的激素。有时它们会出问题，不得不切除。人通常有四个这样的粉红色的小型结构，但它们的大小、数量和位置多变，在手术中难以识别，令医生头疼不已。

我的主任医师在患者脖子上切开了一个切口，然后开始研究切口里的解剖结构。部布满了精细的组织结构，必颁将其剥离，并确保不伤及微小的神经分支。他是一个沉默寡言的外科医生，并没有解释他在做什么，但过了一会儿，他嘟囔道：

「在那儿，看见了吗？」我完全不知道他在说什么。我看不到任何与甲状旁腺有丝毫相似之处的东西。但我不想显得无知，于是保持沉默。似乎过了很长一段时间，我突然看到了他正在处理的东西：我完全没有看到的小块组织。尽管我从课本里学过解剖学，在解剖室里给医学生上过课，并且给不少脖子动过手术，但我并没有看到那些就在我眼皮底下的组织。

看 —— 真正地看，需要很多努力。睁开眼睛，看向某样东西，这并不叫看见。看见是一个主动的过程，需要你全部的注意力。对于我们许多人来说，这种看见的能力并不是天生的；这是一种需要被培养的技能。注意到真实存在的东西，而不是你期望看见的东西，需要一双放松的眼睛、大量的时间以及无限的耐心。

在我还是医学生的时候，我学过如何做身体检查，我把操作步骤记下来了。先看，再摸，然后你才能用听诊器去听。教科书上说，这叫「视诊、触诊、叩诊、听诊」。无论患者有什么症状，这套口诀都不会改变。如果你没有按照正确的顺序操作，如果你遗漏了一个步骤，或者过早地拿出了听诊器，你的顾问医师就会嘲笑你。关键在于用眼睛看：真正地看。

我学会了装模作样地站在离患者病床远远的地方，把手交叉放在背后，用公式般的语言描述我看到的东西，以此来证明我在看。「患者 70 岁，营养状况良好，安静地躺着，没有明显的痛苦。手指未呈杵状，也没有颤抖或甲下裂片形出血。没有使用呼吸辅助肌……」只有在背诵了一连串的身体观察之后，我才会开始触诊，触摸患者，把手放在他们的胸部、腹部或四肢上。即便在那时，我受过的教育也告诉过我，在触摸患者时一定要看着他们的脸，警惕我可能给他们造成痛苦或不适的微小征兆。

在这条原则被灌输给我的时候，我并不理解它的价值。这似乎是浪费时间。当然，如果患者腹痛，你就需要把手放在他们的腹部，看腹部是否疼痛，而不是花很长时间看患者的脸，观察他们的嘴唇是否变蓝。毕竟，和我一起工作的医生们就是这样做的。他们直奔重点。他们会触摸患者的腹部，然后马上把听诊器放在他们胸口。或者看上去如此。

实际上，这些经验丰富的医生首先做了观察，但他们观察得太快了，以至于我没注意到。他们注意到的东西几乎总是比我更多。当他们让我介绍患者的情况时，他们会说「这个患者的指甲怎么不对称」或者「你觉得他的呼吸为什么不均匀」这类的话 —— 我根本没注意到这些东西。他们会把这些线索汇集在一起，做出诊断。

渐渐地，我意识到这种观察的原则是至关重要的。我们应该把患者看作一个人，而不是把关注点集中在它们身体的某个部位，这让我不再草率地得出结论。这件事的重点在于学习如何看见。这就是我和我的顾问医师在做甲状旁腺手术时的区别。他学会了用一种我没学会的方式观察患者。我没有参照物，也没有「接收」我眼睛传递的信息。我从未在活着的患者身上看到过甲状旁腺，也不知道应该去寻找什么。

对于有经验的医生来说，仔细观察已经成了第二天性。然而这个过程可能会在压力下瓦解。在我工作的大学里，我每年都是医学生结业考试的考官，这是他们成为医生之前的最后阶段。我会观察学生对患者做身体检查，展示他们学过的操作程序。视诊、触诊、叩诊、听诊。他们会看、摸、听。然后他们会解释收集到的信息，并给出自己的结论。不管怎样，理论上是这样的。

有一年，我看到一个学生盯着一个患者，一边看表一边摸患者的脉搏。我问他在做什么。「测量脉搏。」他答道。「是多少？」我问。他先是不知所措，然后露出惶恐的表情。他抓起患者的手腕，又开始计数。在当时的压力之下，他只是在做这个动作，仅此而已。他演示了他学到的操作方法，但没有动用他的大脑，也没有加工他所收集到的信息。他视而不见、触而不感，触摸脉搏而没有考虑这对患者来说意味着什么。

现在的医学对于观察和触摸的强调已经少了很多。在我从医学院毕业之后的几十年里，成像技术已经彻底改变了临床实践。超声波、CT、MRI 和 PET 扫描能以惊人的准确性显示体内的解剖结构。在很多方面，这是一个巨大的进步，为医疗人员提供了甚至在几年前都无法想象的细节。但是，虽然把视诊的任务交给专门解读影像的放射科医生的想法很诱人，但这可能会使你和你的患者失去联系，失去把握每名患者特点的全局观。我在很多其他专业领域都注意到了这种问题。过度依赖科技会让你的感官迟钝，让你看不见眼前的东西，也无法对你身边的个体做出反应。

放慢速度、系统全面的训练有着真正的价值。也许是因为我们一直在运用视觉，所以很容易想当然地认为，瞥一眼就能真正看到重要的东西。「视诊」这个术语为「专注地看」赋予了名称，并将其规定为一种必须刻意去做的行为。

然而，在你职业生涯的早期阶段，用细分步骤的方式做事有一定的危险性。你可能会认为，走完过场就等于抓住了要点。这就是在不了解整体的情况下学习组成部分的诱惑。一旦你能做好袋盖，或者剪出直刘海，你就可能认为自己在做西装或发型设计方面拥有了比实际情况更深的造诣。你会变得过于自信，迟早会惨遭打击。

### 4.7 放慢速度

Slowing down

The Dreyfus brothers (Stuart, a mathematician, and Hubert, a philosopher) are widely known for their model of adult skill acquisition, published in their 1986 book Mind Over Machine: The Power of Human Intuition and Expertise in the Era of the Computer . They describe five stages, which they call novice, advanced beginner, competence, proficiency and expertise. Of the final stage, they say, ‘When things are proceeding normally, experts don't solve problems and don't make decisions; they do what normally works.'

A decade later, the researchers H. G. Schmidt, G. R. Norman and H. P. Boshuizen pointed out that ‘there are two separable levels or stages – a rapid, non-analytic dimension, which is used in the majority of problems, and a slower, analytic approach, applied to a minority of problems that present difficulties … neither is to be preferred, since both may lead to a solution'. In 2011, the Nobel Prize–winning author Daniel Kahneman described a similar idea in Thinking, Fast and Slow . He outlined what he calls System 1 and System 2 thinking. ‘System 1', he writes, ‘operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control. System 2 allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it.'

As a junior doctor, presenting patients to my consultant, I noticed how experienced clinicians would switch between modes of reasoning. Sometimes they would go through information sequentially, checking to spot things we might have missed. But for much of the time, they did things in a different way. On the twice-weekly ward round, my chief in his three-piece suit would stop at each patient's bedside, surrounded by his retinue of registrars, housemen, students and nurses. One of us would present the patient's case, summarizing the history, clinical findings and laboratory tests. Sometimes the problem was a difficult one and we hadn't found the diagnosis. At first, I thought that would mean the consultant would order more tests. Often, however, he would just stand quietly and look at the patient. Then he would ask a few questions, carry out a brief examination, then say, ‘I wonder if we should consider …' Usually he'd suggest a diagnosis we hadn't thought of, and more often than not he was right. By looking rather than doing, he was showing us a different way of thinking.

We all have inbuilt biases which can skew our judgement. There's an old adage in medicine that the fracture you're most likely to miss on an X-ray is an unexpected second one – especially if the first one is obvious. When somebody has been in a road accident and has an obvious break of an arm or leg, it's easy to overlook more subtle fractures of the spine or the fingers. What we see is shaped by what we look for, and once we have found something that provides a plausible explanation, we stop looking. Kahneman points out the power of confirmation bias – the tendency we have to make evidence support what we want to believe. We jump to a conclusion, then move on. But as we become expert, we have to counteract this tendency.

Of course, everyone struggles with learning to look properly, to see what's really there. When Joshua was struggling with pocket flaps, he couldn't see why his master Ron said his work was wrong. It looked fine to Joshua. But Ron could tell by looking that it wasn't good enough, that it wouldn't lie properly or match the body of the jacket. Like my chief the parathyroid surgeon, and my fisherman friend who could see the fish in the bend of the river, Ron noticed things that less experienced people couldn't see.

It's surprisingly easy for your glance to skate over what's in front of you, like mine with the invisible fish. You can believe that you've looked properly, only to find later that you haven't. How many times have we checked over an email, only to find the spelling mistake after it's been sent? We tend to see what we think is there, rather than what actually is.

Drawing is a discipline that forces you to register what you see. Tiny details matter when you're drawing something, and a cursory glance is not enough. You have to let your gaze sink into what you're looking at, and fix it in your memory. The artist and embroiderer Fleur Oakes, one of my colleagues at the Art Workers' Guild, describes drawing as ‘looking at something for longer than you normally would'. It's the looking that's the crucial part. Drawing helps you register what you see by connecting your eyes, your body and your brain.

Drawing has always been central to artists, whatever their specialism. In former times, the students at the Royal Academy of Arts, where I'm now the Professor of Anatomy, had a rigorous training which started by drawing plaster casts of classical statues. Only once they became proficient at that were they allowed to move on to life classes with living human models. At some art schools, tutors even positioned these life models upstairs and made their students put their easel in the basement. The students had to decide which aspects of the model to keep in their mind as they made each trip downstairs to add another detail. Although there's less focus on life drawing at art schools nowadays, many current experts went through that kind of rigour when they were training. But drawing isn't something that only artists do. It's just as useful in any other area of work.

Making a mark on paper forces you to home in on what is essential and think about the information you want to convey. We all use some form of drawing, whether we recognize it or not. If you're a pianist annotating a score, a lawyer sketching out an argument, a writer drafting a plot or a surgeon summarizing an operation in a patient's case notes, you'll almost certainly make marks on paper (or perhaps a screen) to communicate. Those marks become a way of distilling what is central and leaving the rest out.

德雷福斯（Dreyfus）兄弟（数学家斯图尔特·德雷福斯以及哲学家休伯特·德雷福斯）因其技能获得模型而闻名。该模型发表于他们在 1986 年出版的《心灵胜于机器：计算机时代的人类直觉和专长的力量》（Mind Over Machine: The Power of Human Intuition and Expertise in the Era of the Computer）书。他们提出了五个阶段，即他们所说的新手（novice）、高级初学者（advanced beginner）、胜任者（competence）、精通者（proficiency）和专家（expertise）。对于最后一个阶段，他们说：「在正常情况下，专家不解决问题，也不做决定，他们会做通常有效的事情。」

十年后，研究者 H.G. 施密特（H.G.Schmidt）、G.R. 诺曼（G.R. Norman）和 H.P. 博舒森（H.P. Boshuizen）指出：「有两种不同的水平或阶段 —— 一种快速的、非分析性的层面，应用于大多数问题；还有一种缓慢的、分析性的方法，应用于少数困难的问题…… 两者没有好坏之分，因为它们都可能得出解决方法。」2011 年，诺贝尔奖得主丹尼尔·卡尼曼（Daniel Kahneman）在《思考，快与慢》（Thinking，Fast and Slow）一书中讲述了相似的理念。他概述了他所说的「系统 1」和「系统 2」式的思维。他写道：「系统 1 的运行是自动而快速的，几乎不需要任何努力，也不需要有意的控制。系统 2 会将注意力分配到需要努力的脑力活动上。」

在做实习医生的时候，我在向顾问医师介绍患者情况的过程中发现，有经验的医生会在不同的推理模式之间转换。有时他们会按顺序浏览信息，检查我们可能会遗漏的东西。但是在大部分时间里，他们会以另一种方式行事。在每周两次的查房中，我的主任医师会穿着他的三件套西装，站在每个患者的床边，一群随行的住院医师、实习医生、学生和护士围在他身边。我们当中的一个人会介绍患者的情况，总结病史、临床表象与化验结果。有时问题很棘手，我们都无法做出诊断。一开始，我以为顾问医师会因此要求做更多的检查。然而，他常常只会静静地站在那里，看着患者。然后他会问几个问题，做一个简单的检查，然后说：「我在想，我们是否应该考虑……」他通常会提出一个我们都没想到的诊断，但他多半是对的。通过观察而不是行动，他向我们展示了一种不同的思维方式。

我们都有内在的偏见，其会误导我们的判断。医学上有句老话：你在 Ⅹ 光检查中最可能忽视的骨折是意料之外的第二处骨折 —— 尤其是在第一处骨折很明显的情况下。如果一个人遭遇了车祸，胳膊或腿上有一处明显的骨折，那医生就很容易忽视脊柱或手指的细微裂痕。我们会看到什么，取决于我们在寻找什么，一旦我们找到了可以提供合理解释的东西，我们就不会再观察了。卡尼曼指出了证实偏见的力量 —— 我们倾向于用证据支持我们想要相信的东西。我们会草率得出结论，然后不再多想。但随着我们逐渐成为专家，我们必须克服这种倾向。

当然，每个人都会在学习正确看待问题、看清事实真相的时候遇到困难。约书亚在为了制作袋盖而苦苦挣扎的时候，他不明白为什么师父罗恩总说他做得不对。在约书亚看来他做得不错，但罗恩一眼就能看出他做得不够好，这样的袋盖缝在西装上不会服帖，或者与西装主体不搭配。就像我那位做甲状旁腺手术的主任医师、能看到河湾里的鱼的朋友一样，罗恩能注意到一些经验不足的人看不到的东西。

你的眼睛很容易忽略你眼前的东西，就像我的眼睛忽略那些看不见的鱼一样。你可能认为你已经仔细地看了，后来却发现其实你没有。有多少次我们曾经检查过一封电子邮件，却在发送后发现了拼写错误？我们倾向于看见我们认为存在的东西，而看不到真实存在的东西。

绘画是一门迫使你记住你所看见的东西的学科。在画画的时候，微小的细节很重要，粗略地看一眼是不够的。你必须让目光停留在你所观察的东西上，让这件东西镌刻在你的记忆里。我在艺术工作者行会中的一位同事，艺术家、刺绣师弗勒尔·奥克斯（Fleur Oakes）说，绘画是「用长于一般情况的时间盯着某件东西看」。观察才是最关键的部分。绘画通过连接你的眼睛、身体和大脑来帮助你记住你所看到的东西。

绘画一直是艺术家的核心技能，无论他们的专业是什么。从前，皇家美术学院（我现在是那里的解剖学教授）的学生都要接受严格的绘画训练，从画古典雕塑的石膏模型开始。只有当他们在这方面变得熟练之后，才能进入有真人模特的写生课程。

在有些艺术学校，老师甚至让写生模特待在楼上，让学生把画架放在地下室。在写生时，在每次下楼添加一处细节时，学生必须决定记住模特的哪一方面的特征。虽然现在的艺术学校对于写生绘画的关注有所减少，但当今许多艺术专家在上学时都受过这种严格的训练。绘画并不是只有艺术家才会做的事。它在其他工作领域也同样有用。

在纸上做个记号能迫使你关注重要的东西，思考你想要传达的信息。不管我们能否意识到，我们都在使用某种形式的绘画。如果你是在乐谱上做注解的钢琴家，在草拟论点的律师，在设计剧情的作家，或是在患者病历中总结手术的外科医生，你几乎肯定都会在纸上（或屏幕上）做出记号来传达思想。这些记号成了提炼核心信息、剔除其余内容的方式。

### 4.8 整合所有信息

Putting it all together

Back in the operating theatre with Poppy and her typhoid perforations, I'm bringing all my senses together. I'm tuning in to what her body is telling me. I'm reconfiguring the information I'm gathering through sight, touch and smell, and turning it into action. Although I'm out of my depth, I just have to do the best I can. Gingerly I go through the steps I've learned for a bowel resection. At every stage I'm treading on eggshells. I know I have to remove the areas that have perforated and cut back to healthy bowel. But what is healthy bowel? None of it looks healthy to me. Yet I need to preserve as much as possible.

In the end I have to make a decision and hope for the best. I remove the segments of intestine that are beyond repair, then reconnect what's left as gently as I can. Eventually I close Poppy's abdomen, cross my fingers and ask the anaesthetist to wake her up. All through that night I keep checking on her to make sure she's stable.

As I'd suspected, that operation is just the first stage, and Poppy has a stormy post-operative course. The next day she becomes sicker. I take her back to theatre and remove some more intestine. The same thing happens again a few days after that. But eventually, after several weeks, she starts to recover. Soon we're able to move her from intensive care, disconnect her tubes and monitors, and wheel her to a bed on the general ward. Gradually, she starts to improve.

As she regains strength, I get to know Poppy better. I discover that she teaches English at a primary school in Soweto. Sometimes I sit next to her after the ward round for a few minutes. We talk about her plans and her ambitions, her family and the people she works with. In the weeks that follow, Poppy gradually builds up stamina. She starts to move around, first with the help of a nurse and then on her own. One day she takes a few steps into the sunshine. When I go past the ward after that, I often see her in a chair, reading. Eventually, at long last, she's fit enough to go home. Seeing her leave the hospital on her way back to her family and her classroom is something I'll never forget.

回到手术室里，面对波比和她的肠伤寒穿孔，我运用了我所有的感官。我在接收她身体告诉我的所有信息。我将视觉、触觉和嗅觉收集的信息重新组合，转化为行动。虽然我能力有限，但我必须尽我所能。我小心翼翼地做着我学过的肠切除术的步骤。在每一阶段，我都如履薄冰。我知道我必须切除穿孔的区域，留下健康的肠子。可什么才是健康的肠子？我看所有的肠子都不健康。但是我必须尽可能保留更多的肠子。

最后，我必须做决定，并抱着最乐观的希望。我将无法修复的肠子切除，然后尽可能轻柔地将剩余部分重新连接起来。最后，我缝合了波比的腹腔，交叉手指，祈求最好的结果，然后让麻醉师唤醒她。整个晚上我都在不断地检查她的情况，以确保她的状态稳定。

正如我所怀疑的那样，手术只是第一步，波比在手术后还要经历许多波折。第二天，她的病情加重了。我把她带回手术室，又切除了一些肠子。几天后，同样的事情又发生了。但最终，在几周后，她开始康复了。很快我们就把她转出了重症监护室，拿掉了她身上的导管和监视器，把她推回普通病房的床上了。渐渐地，她的状况开始好转。

随着波比的体力逐渐恢复，我对她有了更多的了解。我了解到她在索韦托的一所小学教英语。有时在巡查病房之后，我会在她旁边坐上几分钟。我们聊过她的计划与抱负、她的家庭与同事。在接下来的几周里，波比的体力逐渐恢复。她开始四处走动，先是在护士的帮助下，然后是自己独立行走。有一天她在阳光下走了几步。我在之后经过病房时，常看见她坐在椅子上读书。后来，她终于可以回家了。看到她离开医院，回到她的家庭和教室里，是我永远不会忘记的事情。

## 0501. 空间与他人

0501 Space and other people

Back to Manchester Royal Infirmary, this time in 1976. It's the middle of the night and I'm fast asleep when my pager goes off. I'm a bit more experienced than when I started the bloods that Sunday morning in Chapter 3 , though I'm still a medical student. Now I'm on my maternity attachment. I've been hauled out of bed to repair an episiotomy, the scissor cut into a woman's vagina which a midwife or obstetrician sometimes has to make during delivery. Its purpose is to release tension and minimize the chances of the baby's head splitting important structures such as the mother's anal sphincter. I'd learned to make these cuts when I was delivering babies. Then I found out the hard way that episiotomies are easier to make than to repair.

At that time, students were often called at night to sew up episiotomies, because nobody else wanted to do it. The excitement of bringing a baby into the world has simmered down, and the patient is usually exhausted. Of course, repairing a cut of this kind is crucial for the patient later on. It can have a major impact on a mother's continence and sexual function. I'm painfully aware that I need to get things right, but I'm not sure how.

From the few episiotomy repairs I've seen and done, I know that when I arrive my patient will be in the lithotomy position, her feet in stirrups and her legs splayed. It's undignified and uncomfortable. Gowned and gloved, I'll sit between her legs with a portable operating light shining into her vagina. A nurse will put a sterile suturing pack with instruments, swabs, and small dishes for antiseptic solution onto a trolley next to me. After opening the pack and adding syringes, suture needles and local anaesthetic, the nurse will probably go away and do something else. I'll be left bleary-eyed and uncertain, staring into a dark cavity with blood oozing out, trying to make sense of my patient's anatomy, which won't look anything like the neat diagrams in my textbook. Then I'll have to remember what to do next.

Tonight my patient is Brenda. She's just given birth to Emma, her first baby. It's been a long labour and Brenda's exhausted. All she wants to do is sleep. But first there's her episiotomy to deal with. Shyly I introduce myself, trying to project a confidence I don't feel. ‘Are you the doctor who delivered my baby?' she asks. Embarrassed, I stammer that I'm not yet a doctor, but I've been sent to sew up the cut her midwife had to make.

I take my seat between Brenda's legs, which are covered with green sterile drapes. Now I'm unable to see her face or make eye contact. I try to keep up a conversation, though it's difficult to do that and keep track of the procedure at the same time. I lapse into silence and focus on the task. I clean the perineal wound with antiseptic, then draw up some local anaesthetic and inject it slowly, as I've been shown. Brenda flinches and I realize that I was concentrating so hard on the procedure that I forgot to warn her that I'd be giving her an injection. My fragile confidence shatters and I feel mortified. I'm out of my depth, I can't see the expression of the person I'm talking to and my conversational landmarks have disappeared. Fortunately, this time, the nurse is still standing there. She holds Brenda's hand, tells her what I'm doing – then leaves me to get on with it. I need to suture the episiotomy and keep Brenda's confidence at the same time. How?

再次回到曼彻斯特皇家医院，不过这一次我们来到了 1976 年。当时正是深夜，我正在熟睡，而我的呼机响了起来。虽然我依然是一名医学生，但比起第 3 章开始采血时的我，此时的我经验更丰富一些。我此时正在产科实习。我经常被人从床上叫起来，去修复会阴切开术的伤口 —— 在妇女分娩过程中，助产士或产科医生有时会用剪刀剪开产妇的阴道。这样做的目的是缓解产道压力，减少婴儿头部撕裂重要结构（如母亲的肛门括约肌）的可能性。我在给婴儿接生的时候学过做这样的切口。后来我才发现，做会阴切开术比修复更容易。

那个时候，学生经常会在夜晚被叫去缝合会阴切开术的伤口，因为别人都不愿意做这事。把婴儿带到这个世界上的兴奋已经褪去，而患者通常已经筋疲力尽。当然，修复这种切口对患者以后的生活是至关重要的。它会对母亲的控尿能力与性功能产生重大的影响。我痛苦地意识到我需要把事情做好，但我不确定该怎么做。

根据我见过和做过的几次会阴切开修复术的经验，我知道当我到达时，患者会处于截石位，她的双脚会放在腿架上，双腿张开。这是一个毫无尊严又不舒服的姿势。我穿上手术服，戴上手套，坐在她两腿之间，用便携式手术灯照进她的阴道。护士会把一个无菌缝合包放在我旁边的手推车上，包里有手术器械、棉签和装满消毒液的小碟子。在打开缝合包、准备好注射器、缝合针、局部麻醉剂之后，护士可能会离开去做其他事情。只剩下我一个人，睡眼蒙眬、犹豫不决地盯着一个流血的黑色空洞，试图弄清患者的解剖结构，这和教科书里清晰的图表完全不同。然后我得想起下一步该做什么。

我今晚的患者是布伦达。她刚刚生下来了她的第一个孩子埃玛。这是一次漫长的生产，布伦达已经筋疲力尽了。她只想睡觉，但我们先要处理她的会阴切开术。我怯生生地介绍了自己，试图表现出一种我没感觉到的自信。「你是给我孩子接生的医生吗？」她问。我很尴尬，结结巴巴地说我还不是医生，而是被派来缝合助产士不得不切开的伤口的人。

我坐在布伦达的双腿之间，她的腿上盖着绿色的无菌手术巾。现在我看不到她的脸，也不能做眼神交流。我试着继续聊天，但我很难一边说话，一边注意我正在做的手术。我陷入了沉默，专注于自己的任务。我用消毒液清洗了会阴伤口，然后用注射器抽取了一些局部麻醉剂，慢慢地将麻醉剂注射到她体内，就像别人给我展示的那样。布伦达颤抖了一下，我意识到我太专注于手术，以至于忘了提醒她我要给她打针。我脆弱的信心破碎了，我感到很羞愧。我的处境超出了我的能力范围，我看不见谈话对象的表情，我也不知道该说什么。幸运的是，这一次，护士还站在那里。她握住布伦达的手，告诉她我在做什么 —— 然后让我专心去做。我需要缝合会阴切开术的伤口，同时保持布伦达对我的信心。我到底该怎么做？

### 5.1 准备工作

Developing mise en place

Part of this is about having a system to work with. When I started repairing episiotomies, I would shake the instruments out of their sterile pack and make a start. But each time I needed to pick up the needle-holder or grab another swab, I had to take my eye off my patient as I cast about amongst the clutter. When I looked again, the bleeding point would have vanished from view and I'd be back at square one.

One night, a kindly midwife saw me struggling. She came over and explained how to set things out in a logical sequence, so I could put my hand on what I needed, almost without looking. She asked if I was right- or left-handed, then showed me how to ensure the essential instruments were within easy reach. It made a huge difference, and from then on I laid out each pack in the same order. Eventually this became second nature, and I didn't even register I was doing it. In retrospect, this approach seems so obvious that I can't understand why I didn't realize it from the start. But at the time it wasn't obvious. None of the doctors ever mentioned it – it took someone else to point it out before the penny dropped. Even then, nobody gave it a name.

Years later, I learned that chefs describe this as ‘mise en place', a French expression meaning ‘organizing your workplace'. This is a fundamental principle in the high-pressure world of the restaurant kitchen, where everything depends on split-second timing and flawless coordination.

Mise en place is not just for the kitchen, though. It's how we can get into an unfamiliar car, identify the controls for headlights, indicators and horn, and drive. Yet small departures from what you are used to can still throw you off balance. An unfamiliar mise en place takes time to adjust to. Anyone who's driven a hired car will know how easy it is to find you've turned on the windscreen wipers instead of indicating a turn.

By now you're partway along the Apprentice section of the path towards becoming expert. You're becoming familiar with tools and materials, and you're learning how to read your own body as you work. But becoming expert is not just about tools and materials. It's about the way you interact with the world around you. To flourish within a system, you need to learn how it works and you need to fit in. That's what you do when you're starting.

As a beginner, it's easy to focus on individual tasks without noticing how your workplace is structured. By fitting into a way of working that is already there, you can overlook the importance of your environment. In any system, the materials and tools you work with have already been organized.

Experts don't work on only one task, so their focus is not just on the work in front of them. They have prepared things in advance and know where they've put them. They pay attention to how their workplace is arranged, to where their tools are, to what they will be doing next and how to lay their hands on what they need. Often they share their space with other people, and they have to notice and respect what others are doing. They put things back after using them, and they never use somebody else's tools. It's easy not to register their systematic approach, because it appears to be so effortless.

It was Jozef Youssef who explained to me about mise en place. Jozef is the founder and chef patron of Kitchen Theory , an experimental restaurant in north London which he describes as a design studio with a chef's table. Jozef's passion is what he calls ‘multisensory gastronomy'. If you go there for a meal , you'll experience a succession of unusual courses, each engaging your senses in a different way. Jozef's creations play with vision, touch and hearing, as well as taste and smell. They invite you to see, hear, feel, smell and savour. Jozef only puts on his chef's table once a month, and then only for fourteen diners. The rest of the time he works with schools, industrial partners and academics to widen people's ideas about the world of food. Yet he started with a traditional training.

Like all the experts in this book, Jozef has been through the stages of doing time, using his senses and navigating space – in his case, in the kitchen and front of house. He's worked his way up through the hierarchy of fine dining, spending time in some of the world's leading restaurants. He's earned his stripes in Michelin-starred establishments. But wherever he's worked, mise en place is crucial. Everyone in a professional kitchen has to know exactly where everything is, from their knives and chopping boards to the ingredients for those last-minute touches as a dish leaves the kitchen for a table. Everyone depends on a shared understanding of how this works. Disrupting another cook's mise en place, like using another cook's knife, is a cardinal sin.

The need to be systematic is dinned into culinary students from day one. Mise en place starts with writing down the day's tasks in the order you'll perform them, specifying everything you'll need and making sure you can lay your hands on it at a moment's notice. When you join the ‘brigade' of a professional kitchen, mise en place must have become second nature.

Jozef told me about the thousands of vol-au-vents he prepared at The Dorchester, a leading London centre of haute cuisine. The kitchen team were setting up for a high-profile function several weeks ahead. As Jozef finished making each batch of puff pastry, it was transferred to a freezer to wait for further preparation ahead of the big day, when he'd complete the vol-au-vents. These were just one element of one dish on a menu of five courses. Putting on a massive culinary event like that demands military precision. Remembering exactly where in the cold storage units he'd stored those earlier preparations was part of Jozef's mise en place. He couldn't afford to get it wrong.

Not many people work in Michelin-starred restaurants, but we all need mise en place. Whether we're keeping track of our tools in the garden shed or knowing where the spare light bulbs are in our house, mise en place is how we take the strain off our memory and minimize cognitive load. Anyone who has tried to memorize a string of phone numbers understands the value of an address book. It's the same with physical space.

Experts all develop systems which work for them. Derek Frampton's taxidermy workshop and Andrew Davidson's engraving studio didn't look highly organized to me. I wouldn't have known where they kept things. Yet both of them could lay their hands on whatever tool or material they needed, without even looking. There was a place for everything and everything was in its place; I just didn't know what those places were. Where they recognized order, I saw only clutter.

As a newcomer to their world, I could have easily mistaken their set-up for the absence of any system at all. Someone looking at my writing desk would probably say the same. In both cases, that would be a mistake. These systems represent a distillation of years of experience, of experts having found what works for them.

Part of becoming expert is taking control of your environment. When I see Joshua in his workshop, he has his scissors, thread, tailor's chalk and cloth within easy reach. He and the other experts I've worked with all have their mise en place, though most of them don't use that term. Yet though a systematic approach is expected in almost every area of expert practice, this is seldom explained to novices. As I discovered when I was learning to repair episiotomies, as a beginner you are expected to know all this without being told. If you're lucky, someone helps you. But often no one does.

People often allow the arrangement of their workplace to be dictated to them; they forget they have agency to change it. Kirsty Flower, one of my colleagues at Imperial, told me it was only after years in the laboratory as a postdoctoral molecular biologist that she realized that she was a left-handed scientist working in a right-handed system. Since starting as an undergraduate, she had fitted into a system that was already there. Every time she picked up a pipette, she had to reach awkwardly across her workspace to the specimen bottles on the other side. Because she had always worked like that, it hadn't occurred to her to change her apparatus round. She was focusing on the work, not her system for doing it. Once she rearranged things, her work became much easier.

This highlights a characteristic of the Apprentice phase. You know that everyone else knows more than you, and you want to be part of the group. You don't want to look like an idiot, so you copy other people. But you are only mimicking what you've seen them do. You don't yet understand why or how they do it. So you often miss the finer points that later you'll come to rely on. You seldom have the confidence to shape your workplace, to impose your will on your environment – or even to adjust your chair to suit your height. Like me with my early attempts at episiotomy repair, you work with what you find rather than shaping it to your requirements.

It's easy to work in a mess at home, in your workshop, your kitchen or at your desk, as long as it's your mess. You know your own clutter, you have a sense of where you keep things, and it works for you. If you're working alone, it doesn't matter what your space looks like, as long as you can find what you need the moment you need it. But if you work with other people, there are reasons for maintaining an orderly space. Anyone who works in an open-plan office has had the experience of reaching for the stapler, only to find that someone has borrowed it and not put it back, or that someone has moved the pile of papers you were working on. This explains why sharing a workspace can be so stressful.

Often you only notice mise en place when it's disrupted. When someone comes to stay in your house and helps dry the dishes after supper, you often can't find utensils for weeks afterwards. Your visitors have put things in places that make sense to them but not to you. Objects have been misfiled, as if they were books on the wrong shelf in a library. It's bad enough if you can't find a saucepan. It's worse when you're working in a garage and you can't find the wrench you need because someone else hasn't put it back. In the operating theatre, of course, the stakes are especially high. There, the system for tracking tools is formalized, codified and directed by someone who is expert in exactly that – the scrub nurse.

The scrub nurse is a crucial part of the surgical team, responsible for all the instruments and materials used during an operation. They have to ensure that nothing is left inside a patient after a procedure is completed. Everything has to be counted in and counted out. Working closely with the surgeons, scrub nurses have to be able to lay their hands instantly on whatever instrument is needed and put it back there after use. They have to work within a consistent system that allows a scrub nurse from one theatre to move seamlessly to another. Yet they also customize their mise en place in a way that fits with how they personally like to work.

But the role of the scrub nurse goes far beyond handing over instruments and keeping track of them. Expert scrub nurses are constantly vigilant, paying close attention to the procedure and anticipating what will be needed. Like the highly experienced Sister Ramaphosa at Bara in Soweto, scrub nurses have years of experience. They can teach others in their team a huge amount. They are a crucial part of the community of practice of the operating theatre, using an unspoken language to communicate which even they are often unaware of.

When I did some research using video to analyse long-established surgical teams, I noticed a scrub nurse passing a pair of surgical scissors to the surgeon before he asked for them. Slowing down the film, you could see the surgeon holding out his hand, the nurse placing the scissor handles in his palm, the surgeon closing his fingers and starting to use the instrument, and only then saying, ‘Scissors, please, Sister.' Playing the video for them afterwards, neither the surgeon nor the nurse had any recollection of what had happened. They had worked together for so many years that their actions had become instinctive. Old-school surgeons I worked for would even say, ‘For heaven's sake, Sister, give me what I want , not what I asked for,' relying on that unspoken rapport that only comes from a long collaboration. This is the inheritance of a strong, well-organized mise en place.

要做好这件事，就需要找到一套可行的方法。我开始修复会阴切开术时，我要把无菌包里的器械拿出来再动手。但我每次需要拿起持针钳或另一个棉签时，我都不得不把目光从患者身上移开，在杂物中四处寻找。我再看向患者时，出血点已经从视野中消失了，而我又得从头做起。

一天晚上，一位好心的助产士看到了我的困境。她走了过来，向我解释如何按照逻辑的顺序摆放器械，这样我就能把手放在我需要的东西上，几乎不用低头去看。她问我是右利手还是左利手，然后告诉我如何确保将重要的工具放在触手可及的地方。如此一来，情况大有改观。从那以后，我每次都把无菌包里的东西按同样的顺序摆放。后来，这种习惯成了我的第二天性，我甚至没有意识到自己在这样做。回想起来，这种做法似乎是显而易见的，以至于我不明白自己为什么一开始没有想到。但这一点在当时看来，并没有那么明显。没有一个医生提到过这种做法 —— 直到有人指出来，我才恍然大悟。即便在当时，也没有人专门给这种方法命名过。

多年以后，我发现厨师将这种做法称为「准备工作」，这是一种法国俗语，意思是「整理你的工作场合」。这是在餐厅厨房这种高压环境里的一项基本原则。在那里，一切都取决于稍纵即逝的时机和完美的协调配合。

不过，「准备工作」并不只适用于厨房。我们进入一辆陌生的汽车时也会这样做：找到前灯、转向灯、喇叭的控制器，然后再开始驾驶。然而，如果真实情况与你的习惯有微小的偏差，依然会让你感到有些不适应。不熟悉的「准备工作」需要你花一些时间去适应。任何租过车的人都知道，想打开转向灯却误打开雨刷器是多么常有的事。

到现在为止，在成为专家的道路上，你已经走完了学徒阶段的一半。你对工具和工作对象越来越熟悉，你也在学习如何在工作中读懂自己的身体。但是，成为专家不仅与工具和工作对象有关，其重点在于你与周围世界的互动方式。要在一个系统中蓬勃发展，你需要了解这个系统是如何运作的，你需要融入其中。这就是你在开始时需要做的。

作为一个初学者，你很容易将关注点放在个人的任务上，而忽视了你工作场所的结构。你已经适应了既有的工作方式，可能会忽视环境的重要性。在任何系统里，你要处理的工作对象与工具都已经被整理好了。

专家不会只专注于一项任务，所以他们的关注点不会只放在眼前的工作上。他们会提前准备好各种事物，知道它们应该放在哪里。他们会关注工作场所是如何配置的，他们的工具在哪里，他们接下来要做什么，以及如何获取自己需要的东西。他们经常与他人共享自己的空间，他们必须注意并尊重他人的所作所为。他们用完东西就会放回原处，从不使用别人的工具。他人很难注意到专家的严谨周密的工作方法，因为他们的方法看上去毫不费力。

约瑟夫·优素福（Jozef Youssef）向我解释了「准备工作」。约瑟夫是「厨房理论」餐厅的创始人和老板，那是一家位于伦敦北部的实验性餐。约瑟夫称「厨房理论」是一间有着料理台的设计工作室。约瑟夫的激情是他所谓的「多感官美食」。

如果你去那里用餐，你会体验到一系列不同寻常的菜肴，每道菜都会用不同的方式吸引你的各种感官。约瑟夫的菜肴除了调动你的味觉和嗅觉以外，还会调动视觉、触觉和听觉。它们会邀请你去看、去听、去感受、去闻、去品味。约瑟夫每个月只下一次厨，并且只给 14 位食客下厨。在其余时间里，他会与学校、行业合作伙伴和学者合作，拓宽公众对于食品世界的看法。

然而他在一开始接受的是传统的烹饪训练。就像本书中的所有专家一样，约瑟夫也经历了积累、运用感官、在空间内摸索的阶段 —— 在他的例子里，他的空间是餐厅的厨房和前厅。他在高档餐饮领域内努力向上攀登，在一些世界顶尖的餐厅工作过。他曾在米其林星级餐厅积累过经验。

无论他在哪里工作，「准备工作」都是至关重要的。在专业厨房里，人人都必须知道每样东西的确切位置 —— 从菜刀到案板，再到菜肴离开厨房摆上餐桌前最后一刻要用到的调料。每个人都依赖于对这套工作制度的共同理解。干扰其他厨师的「准备工作」，就像使用其他厨师的菜刀一样，是一种大忌。

烹饪学生从第一天起就被灌输了这种井井有条的需要。「准备工作」始于按顺序写下当天的任务，详细列出你需要的所有东西，确保你可以随时拿到它们。当他们加入专业厨房的队伍时，「准备工作」已经成了他们的第二天性。

约瑟夫跟我说过他曾在多切斯特酒店餐厅制作过成千上万个酥皮馅饼。多切斯特酒店餐厅是伦敦首屈一指的高级烹饪中心。当时厨房团队正在为几周后的一项备受瞩目的活动做准备。约瑟夫每做完一批酥皮，就把它们放进冰箱里，等到大日子到来之前再做进一步的加工，他会在那时做好酥皮馅饼。这只是五道菜中的一道菜里的一个要素。举办这样的大型烹饪活动需要军事行动一般的精确调度。准确记住他事先准备好的酥皮放在冷藏室的什么位置，是约瑟夫的「准备工作」的一部分。他决不能出错。

在米其林星级餐厅工作的人并不多，但人人都需要「准备工作」。无论我们是要记住花园小棚里的工具摆放位置，还是弄清家里备用的灯泡在哪儿，「准备工作」都是我们减轻记忆压力，尽可能减少认知负荷的方法。任何一个试图记住一连串电话号码的人，都明白号码本的价值。同样的道理也适用于物理空间。专家都会发展出适合自己的系统。在我看来，德里克·弗兰普顿的标本剥制工坊和安德鲁·戴维森的雕刻工作室并不是很有条理。我不知道他们把东西都放在哪里。然而，他们两人甚至不用看就能拿到他们需要的任何工具或工作对象。每样东西都各就各位，每样东西都在该在的地方。只是我不知道那些地方在哪儿。他们眼中的秩序，在我看来是混乱。

我作为一个刚刚进入他们世界的新人，很容易会误以为他们的布置杂乱无章。别人看见我的写字台可能也会说同样的话。在这两种情况下，这都是不正确的。这两种系统都是多年经验的结晶，是专家找到适合自己的方法的结果。

成为专家的一部分在于控制你的环境。我在约书亚的工作室里见到他时，他的剪刀、线、裁缝用的粉笔和布料都触手可及。他与和我打过交道的其他专家都有自己的「准备工作」，不过他们大多数人都不会使用这个术语。然而，尽管几乎在所有专业实践领域内，都需要一套系统性方法，但很少有人把这一点解释给新手。正如我在学习修复会阴切开术时发现的那样，作为一个初学者，大家不会告诉你这些，却希望你知道这一切。

如果你幸运的话，有人会帮助你，但通常没有人这么做。人们常常听任别人安排自己的工作场所，他们忘记了自己拥有改变环境的能动性。我在帝国理工学院的同事柯丝蒂·弗劳尔（Kirsty Flower）告诉我，直到在实验室做分子生物学博士后的数年之后，她才意识到自己是一个在右利手系统中工作的左利手科学家。从上大学开始，她就融入了一个既有的系统。

每次拿起移液管，她都得笨拙地伸手越过工作空间，去拿另一边的样本瓶。她一直都是这样工作的，所以她从没想过改变身边的器具布置。她专注于工作，却因此没有注意她所处的系统。

一旦她重新布置了各种事物，她的工作就容易多了。这个例子凸显了学徒阶段的一个特点。你知道其他人比你懂得多，而你想成为团队的一员。你不想看起来像个傻瓜，于是你模仿他人。但你只是在模仿你看见他们所做的事情。你还不明白他们为什么这样做，也不知道他们是怎样做的。所以你常会忽略以后需要依赖的细节。你很少会有信心去改造自己的工作场所，把自己的意志施加于环境 —— 甚至不敢调整椅子以适应你的身高。就像我当初尝试做会阴切开修复术一样，你会去适应你看到的环境，而不会按照自己的需要来改造环境。

在家里、工坊里、厨房里或书桌上的混乱中工作是很容易的，只要这是属于你的混乱。只要你对自己的杂物了如指掌，知道你把东西都放在哪里，那种布置就适合你。如果你独自工作，你的空间看起来如何并不重要，只要你能在需要的时候找到需要的东西就好。但如果你和其他人一起工作，就应该保持空间的有序。任何在开放式办公室工作过的人都有这样的经历：当你伸手去拿订书机，却发现有人把它借走了，而没放回去；或者有人动了你在处理的一堆文件。这就是为什么与他人共用工作空间可能会给人带来很大的压力。

通常只有在被打乱的情况下你才会注意到「准备工作」。如果有人到你家做客，在晚餐后帮你擦碗，你常常在之后的几周里都找不到餐具。你的客人把东西放在了他们觉得合适的地方，但你觉得不合适。东西放在不合适的地方，就像图书馆的书被放在了错误的书架上。找不到平底锅就已经够糟糕了。更糟的是，你在车库工作，却找不到需要的扳手，因为别人没有把它放回原处。当然，在手术室里，这样做的风险特别高。在那里，有一套制度规定工具该放在哪里，这套制度由专门从事这方面工作的人员制定、实施和管理 —— 这些人就是洗手护士。

洗手护士是外科团队的重要组成部分，负责手术过程中的所有器械和材料。他们必须确保在手术结束后，没有任何东西留在患者的体内。每样东西的进出都要有数。洗手护士与外科医生密切合作，他们必须能够立即把手放在任何需要的器械上，并且在使用后将其放回原位。他们必须按照一个固定的流程工作，这样洗手护士在任何一个外科手术团队中都能顺利工作。然而，他们也得按照自己喜欢的工作方式来做自己的「准备工作」。

但是，洗手护士的任务远不止递出和收好器械。专家级的洗手护士会时刻保持警惕，密切关注手术过程，并预测接下来需要做什么。就像索韦托巴拉瓜纳医院里经验丰富的拉马福萨护士一样，洗手护士有多年的工作经验。他们可以教给团队里的其他人很多东西。他们是手术室实践社群的重要组成部分。他们会用一种无声的语言交流，甚至连他们自己也没有觉察到。

我用视频分析合作多年的手术团队时，注意到一名洗手护士在外科医生要求之前就把手术剪递给了他。慢放视频，你可以看到外科医生伸出手来，护士把剪刀把手放在他的掌心，外科医生的手指合拢，开始使用器械。直到那时他才说：「护士，剪刀，谢谢。」事后我给这个团队播放视频时，外科医生和护士都不记得发生了什么。他们在一起工作了许多年，他们的动作都成了本能。我曾在一些老派的外科医生手下工作过，他们甚至会说：「看在上帝的分儿上，护士，把我心里想的东西给我，而不是我开口要的东西。」他们很依赖那种只会来自长期合作的默契。这是一种高效的、极有条理的「准备工作」带来的结果。

### 5.2 制作羽管键琴

Making a harpsichord

Joining an organization or working in a group allows you to benefit from having a mise en place that has developed over several years – or even, as in the case of surgery, over centuries. But if you've ever tried to teach yourself something without the help of others, you're likely to have suffered from having to build your own mise en place without the requisite context.

I learned the piano as a child, though not very well. I've always loved baroque music, and for years I had a yen to play the harpsichord. When I was a GP, I thought I'd take the plunge and get one. But harpsichords are expensive and I couldn't justify buying one before I knew if I'd like playing it. My compromise was to build one myself from a kit. Even a kit was almost more than I could afford, and would involve uncertainty and risk. I had no idea if I could even finish it.

After a lot of research, I decided on one made by John Storrs. He had trained as an engineer before going into musical instrument design, and he used that background to ensure that the mission-critical parts of the harpsichord assembly were foolproof – the spacing of the strings, the holes in the wrest plank for the tuning pins, those parts where a hair's breadth of error would result in an unplayable instrument. The parts that required endless patience but limited ability – assembling the jacks and fitting their horsehair bristles; sanding down ebony and bone keys; scraping plectra – he left to each customer.

The kit was based on a seventeenth-century instrument by Hans Ruckers, a famous Flemish maker. It arrived at my house in boxes. We had a small house, so I evicted our younger daughter from her tiny bedroom and turned it into a temporary workshop. There were two slim instruction booklets, one of words and the other of diagrams.

My main problem with building that instrument was that I had no idea what I was aiming for. I had to interpret instructions written by someone who already knew what I didn't. I had no one to help me recognize thin materials on the verge of collapse, no one to advise me about mise en place.

Although a harpsichord is quite small – much shorter than a grand piano, a fraction of its weight and with fewer notes – a lot goes on under the bonnet. The instrument I was making had three strings for each key. Each of those strings has its own jack: a thin slip of wood that sits on the far end of the key and plucks the string with a plectrum when you press down on the key. Each plectrum is seated in a tiny pivoted tongue in the jack, allowing it to pluck the string on the way up but slide silently past it on the way back. The damper, a small square of red felt, fits into a groove in the side of each jack and stops the string sounding once you release the key. It all has to be minutely adjusted.

There were almost two hundred of these jacks. Each of the steps – fitting the tongue, filing a tiny groove for the hog's hair bristle, cutting the damper felts, inserting the plectra – had to be done almost two hundred times, and each involved a new learning curve. Again and again I went from cack-handed ignorance to weary familiarity – that cycle of doing time.

The only way I could keep track of these minuscule parts was by developing my own mise en place. In my daughter's tiny bedroom, I was working in a cramped space. My tray of tools wasn't much bigger than the trolley of instruments I'd used when I was a medical student suturing Brenda's episiotomy after she'd given birth to her baby Emma. I needed a similar sense of order.

A big problem was that I was working alone. I wasn't in a workshop surrounded by other apprentices. All I had were the components of the harpsichord I was going to assemble. I didn't have access to an inherited mise en place, the collective knowledge of generations of harpsichord builders or the shared wisdom of a group. There was no community of practice for me to fit into. I didn't even have an example of a harpsichord to refer to. All I could do was follow the sets of written and illustrated instructions. Most challenging of all, I didn't have a sense of what to expect. I tackled the project one stage at a time, not knowing how all the elements would fit together. Those instruction booklets were a map, but I had no guide.

Gradually, I started to get the hang of things. By the time I'd cut my umpteenth red felt damper, put the finishing touches to yet another ebony key slip, or wound another string from a coil of brass wire, I was becoming comfortable in my workshop and developing my ‘mechanic's feel'.

Anyone who has embarked on a project will have experienced something similar. You have to think through the components you're going to need so you can put your hand on them quickly. Sometimes the challenges are physical, like repairing an engine, suturing an episiotomy or building a harpsichord. Sometimes they are more conceptual, like writing an essay or a book, where you need access to information you've researched and references you'll cite. Whatever your field, you need to organize your workspace. But workspace is only part of the picture.

加入一个组织或在一个团队里工作，可以让你从多年来形成的「准备工作」习惯中受益 —— 在外科的例子里，这种习惯经历了几个世纪的发展。但是，如果你曾经尝试自学而没有别人的帮助，那你可能会因为不得不在没有必要环境的情况下形成自己的「准备工作」而遇到困难。

我小时候学过钢琴，不过弹得不是很好。我一直喜爱巴洛克音乐，多年来一直渴望弹奏羽管键琴。在我做全科医生的时候，我曾想冒险一试，买一台来弹。但是羽管键琴很贵，在知道自己是否喜欢弹奏之前，我实在是没有足够的理由去买。我采取了一条折中的道路：自己动手用组装包做一台。即便是一套组装包也几乎超出了我的消费能力，而且会涉及不确定性和风险。我甚至不知道自己能不能完成这件事。

经过大量研究，我决定使用约翰·斯托尔斯（John Storrs）制作的组装包。在进入乐器设计领域之前，他接受过工程师的训练。他利用这种知识背景来确保羽管键琴的关键组成部件万无一失 —— 琴弦的间距、弦轴板上用于固定弦轴的孔，这些部分有一点点偏差，就会导致乐器无法弹奏。那些需要无尽的耐心，但不需要很高能力的部分 —— 组装顶杆，再给顶杆装上马鬃弹簧，打磨乌木和骨质琴键，刮制弦拨，他把这些工作留给顾客来做。

这套组装包是根据著名的佛兰德斯制造商汉斯·鲁克斯（Hans Ruckers）于 17 世纪制作的一台羽管键琴设计而成的。这套组装包分了好几个箱子送到我家。我家当时的房子很小，所以我把小女儿从她的小卧室里赶了出来，把她的卧室变成了一个临时工坊。组装包里有两本薄薄的说明书，一本是文字，另一本是图表。

我组装这个乐器的主要问题在于，我不知道我的目标是什么。我必须读懂说明书，说明书的作者知道一些我不知道的东西。没有人帮助我分辨脆弱的工作对象何时会濒临崩溃，也没有人建议我该怎样做「准备工作」。

尽管羽管键琴很小 —— 比三角钢琴短得多，也轻得多，琴键也少，但琴盖下的东西很复杂。对于我要制作的这个乐器来说，每个琴键都有三根弦。每根弦也都有自己的顶杆 —— 也就是一片薄木片，安装在琴键的另一端。当你按下琴键时，顶杆就会用弦拨拨动琴弦。每个弦拨都位于顶杆上的一个小小的、能够转动的拨舌上，这样弦拨就能在上升的过程中拨动琴弦，在返回原位时安静地掠过琴弦。制音器是一小块方形的红色毛毡，嵌在每个顶杆侧面的凹槽里。一旦你松开琴键，制音器就会让琴弦停止发声。这些都需要经过细微的调整。

一共大约有 200 个这样的顶杆。每个步骤（安装拨舌、为安装马鬃弹簧锉出一道小小的凹槽、切割制音器、插入弦拨）都得重复大约 200 次，每一次都有新的心得。通过一遍又一遍的重复，我的感觉从一无所知的笨拙变成了令人厌倦的熟悉 —— 这就是积累的过程。

我能找到这些微小零件的唯一方法，就是学会做「准备工作」。在女儿的狭小卧室里，我在拥挤的空间里工作。我的工具托盘并不比我在学生时代给生下宝宝埃玛的布伦达缝合会阴切开术的伤口时所用的器械推车大多少。我需要这种类似的秩序感。

一个大问题是，我此时在独自工作。我不是在工坊里，身边也没有其他学徒。我只有需要组装的羽管键琴零件。我不懂这个领域传承下来的「准备工作」，也没有几代羽管键琴制造者的集体知识，没有群体的共同智慧。没有能够让我融入的实践大社群。我甚至连可供参考的羽管键琴的样例都没有。我只能按照一套图文说明书的指示来做。最具挑战性的是，我不知道接下来会发生什么。我只能一次一个阶段地完成这个项目，不知道所有元素该怎样结合在一起。这两本说明书就像一张地图，而我没有向导。

渐渐地，我开始掌握要领。当我剪裁了无数个红色毛毡制音器，又给一块乌木琴键做完最后的修饰，或者再次用一卷铜线缠绕出一根琴弦时，我在我的「工坊」里越来越得心应手，产生了「机械师的感觉」。

任何开始做一件新事情的人都会有类似的经历。你必须想清楚你需要的各种「零件」，这样你就能迅速找到它们。有时你面临的挑战是身体上的，比如修理引擎、缝合会阴切开术的伤口或制作羽管键琴。有时挑战是概念上的，比如写一篇论文或一本书，这时你就需要找到你研究过的信息和你将要引用的参考文献。无论你的领域是什么，你都需要整理好自己的工作空间。不过工作空间只是一个方面。

### 5.3 个人空间与他人

Personal space and other people

As I assembled that harpsichord at home, I could arrange my workshop as I wanted it. I could design my own mise en place. I didn't get that design right first time, but the only person who suffered from my mistakes was me. But in my medical work, I was sharing space with my patients. Often I needed to examine them, to look at them closely and touch their bodies. This isn't a straightforward process, as I have discovered several times when the roles have been reversed and I've become a patient.

When I started working in London, I bought a motor scooter. One summer evening I was riding home with my visor up when something hit me in the face. I didn't know what it was, but I felt liquid trickling down my cheek and my vision in one eye was blurred. I thought the liquid might be toxic or corrosive, and I was terrified. I went straight to my local eye hospital. First I was seen by a junior ophthalmologist. He seemed as anxious as I was. Though he did all the right things clinically, this doctor's examination made me feel very uncomfortable. He put his face close to mine without any warning, shone a bright light in my eye, then turned my upper eyelid inside out and examined my eye with a slit lamp. I flinched and moved about, and the experience was unpleasant for us both.

Half an hour later I saw the consultant. The experience was completely different. She glided effortlessly into my personal space, unhurried and gentle. Although she did the same things as the trainee – shining a bright light, everting my eyelid, using a slit lamp – she did them in a different way. I felt confident, at ease, happy to let down my barriers and allow her in. Fortunately, it turned out that the liquid was water, and although there was some damage to my eye it recovered in the following weeks. But I've never forgotten her approach. To me, she demonstrated mastery.

Many of the experts in this book work at close quarters with other people. There's a special skill to entering someone else's personal space, that buffer zone which is bounded by an invisible ‘second skin'. This notional space is different for each of us, and our brains continually reconfigure it depending on the social context. The rules and expectations for being comfortable when a stranger approaches you are complex. Shaking hands with someone you've never met is acceptable; holding hands is not.

Some experts – like doctors, dentists, opticians, physiotherapists, osteopaths and massage therapists – work with people's bodies all the time. Bodies are these experts' primary material, their equivalent of the potter's clay, the cabinetmaker's wood or the sculptor's stone. Other experts – like barbers, hairstylists, beauticians, tattoo artists and body piercers – do something similar, though in a non-clinical setting. Tailors, corset-makers and hat designers work with people's bodies at one remove, creating clothes that can be put on and taken off. Others, such as restaurant waiters, close-up magicians and theatre performers, work in people's personal space without touching them at all. Experts in all these fields develop a confidence that you hardly notice.

That sense of ease is characteristic of experts who work with precious materials, whether people or things. It often astonishes me to see a violin virtuoso tuning up before a performance. Even when the instrument is a priceless masterpiece – a Stradivarius or a Guarneri – she will handle it with supreme confidence. She places it gently between her chin and shoulder, taking both hands away before turning the tuning pegs at the end of the violin. Anyone else would be terrified of dropping the instrument in the tension of the moment, but these experts are secure in their mastery. Working with people requires a similar confidence – respectful yet assured.

The neuroscientist Michael Graziano has been working on personal space for decades. He begins his 2018 book, The Spaces Between Us , like this:

We all have an invisible, protective bubble around us. Personal space, margin of safety, bad breath zone, duck-and-flinch buffer – whatever you call it, we have it constantly switched on like a force field. It comes in layers, some layers close to the skin like a bodysuit, others farther away like a quarantine tent. Elaborate networks in the brain monitor those protective bubbles and keep them clear of danger by subtly, or sometimes drastically, adjusting our actions. You walk through a cluttered room weaving effortlessly around the furniture. A pigeon swoops past your head in the street and you duck. You stand a little farther from your boss than from your friend, and much closer to your lover. Usually hidden under the surface of consciousness, occasionally rising into awareness, personal space affects every part of human experience.

Graziano points out that initial notions of personal space as a ‘second skin' developed in the 1960s as a psychological and social phenomenon. Edward T. Hall's The Hidden Dimension , published in 1966, put forward the notion of ‘proxemics', the author's way of interpreting ‘man's use of space as a specialized elaboration of culture'. Hall was building on the work of Heini Hediger, a pioneering animal biologist who developed the field of ‘zoo biology' – the science of wild animals kept in human care.

Hediger, who was the director of the Zurich Zoo, showed that animals in their natural environment live within relatively small bubbles of territory which they take with them when they move. He described different interaction distances between animals. For example, flight distance is the distance an animal will tolerate when confronted by a member of a different species before fleeing. Critical distance is the narrow zone separating flight distance from attack distance (when an animal being pursued will turn and go on the offensive). Personal distance and social distance relate to interactions between animals of the same species. These determine the normal spacing that animals maintain between themselves and others in their group.

Hall's insight was to apply these observations to humans. Although flight distance and critical distance have been largely eliminated, personal and social distance remain. He put forward four categories of distance – intimate, personal, social and public. These distances are not fixed but change with context. They delineate an exclusion zone, a region in which you don't want other people. Hall put it like this: ‘it is in the nature of animals, including man, to exhibit behaviour which we call territoriality. In so doing, they use the sense to distinguish between one space or distance and another. The specific distance chosen depends on the transaction; the relationship of the interacting individuals, how they feel, and what they are doing.'

Since the 1980s there has been an explosion of interest in personal space in the world of experimental neuroscience. It turns out that the space surrounding the body has a special representation in the brain. Graziano's own experimental work, first with monkeys and more recently with humans, demonstrates a highly complex set of specialized ‘multisensory' neurons which allow us to keep track of the location of things, even in the dark. He has shown how sets of behaviours – documented first with animals and their territories, then by social observation of humans – turn out to have a neuroscientific basis that is only now beginning to be unravelled. Graziano writes of a ‘simulated bubble wrap', an invisible second skin surrounding the body that emphasizes nearby space while also registering what happens further away. But unlike Hall's original concept, there is no single giant envelope of space around the body. Every body part seems to have its own bubble. This system allows us to keep track of objects through sight, sound, touch and even memory. It depends on a well-defined set of brain areas and specialized neurons that have elegant properties. The result is to weld our senses together into a visual-auditory-tactile radar for nearby objects.

But our mechanisms for personal space don't only apply to people – we extend our peripersonal buffer zone around our tools as well. That's how we can use a fork or a screwdriver to ‘sense' what it is doing and interpret the space around it. Using the example of a vacuum cleaner, Graziano explains how a person monitors the spaces around the entire wand ‘to make sure it doesn't crash into furniture or doorways and knock over vases, injure the cat, or bruise your own legs'. To use a tool competently, he points out, you must process the space around it. It seems that our brains incorporate the tool into a body schema, creating a modifiable margin of safety that can be extended around a foreign object.

This helps to understand the importance of mise en place – the need for an ordered and familiar environment where much can be taken for granted. In such a set-up, we have reconfigured our peripersonal buffer zones so we can use our energy for the work in hand rather than trying to make sense of the space around us.

当我在家里组装羽管键琴时，可以随心所欲地安排我的「工坊」。我可以设计自己的「准备工作」。虽然我第一次的设计不太合理，但为错误承担后果的人只有我自己。可是在我的医疗工作里，我和患者同处于一个空间。我常常需要给他们检查身体，仔细观察并触摸他们的身体。这不是一个简单的过程，在角色互换、我成为患者的时候，我多次发现了这一点。

刚开始在伦敦工作的时候，我买了一辆摩托车。一个夏天的晚上，我骑车回家，但没有放下头盔的护目镜。突然有什么东西撞上了我的脸。我不知道那是什么，但我感觉有液体从脸颊上流下来，一只眼睛的视线模糊了。我觉得这种液体可能有毒或有腐蚀性，我吓坏了。我直接去了当地的眼科医院。首先来看我的是一位眼科实习医生。他似乎和我一样焦虑。虽然这位医生做的所有事情在临床上都是对的，但他的检查让我很不舒服。他毫无预兆地把脸凑近我的脸，用强光照射我的眼睛，然后翻起我的上眼睑，用裂隙灯检查我的眼睛。我畏缩了一下，忍不住扭动起来，这对我们来说都不是一次愉快的经历。

半小时后，我见到了顾问医师。这次的感觉大不相同。她毫不费力地进入我的个人空间，从容又温柔。虽然她做的事情和那位实习医生一样 —— 打开强光，翻开我的眼睑，使用裂隙灯，但她做的方式不一样。我感到有信心、放松、愿意放下防备、接纳她。幸运的是，那种液体原来是水。尽管我的眼睛受了一些损伤，但在接下来的几周内恢复如初了。不过我从未忘记顾问医师的做法。在我看来，她展现出了高超的技艺。

本书中的许多专家都要与他人近距离地工作。要进入别人的个人空间，有一种特殊的技巧。个人空间是一种缓冲区，周围环绕着无形的「第二层皮肤」。这种假想的空间对我们每个人来说都是不同的，我们的大脑会根据社会情境不断地调整这个空间。在陌生人接近你时，让你感到舒服的规则和期望是复杂的。与从未谋面的人握手是可以接受的，牵手则不是。

有些专家（如牙医、眼科医生、理疗师、整骨师和按摩师）一直在和他人的身体打交道。身体是这些专家的主要工作对象，相当于陶艺师的黏土、家具木工的木材或雕塑家的石头。还有些专家（如理发师、发型设计师、美容师、文身师和身体穿孔师）做的事情也很类似，但是在非临床的情境里。裁缝、束身胸衣制作师、帽子设计师间接地与人体工作，制作可以穿脱的衣物。还有一些人，如餐厅服务员、近景魔术师、戏剧演员，他们在别人的个人空间里工作，但完全不会触碰他人。所有这些领域的专家都有一种你几乎觉察不到的自信。

对于那些与宝贵的工作对象工作的专家来说，这种从容是他们的特点，无论他们的工作对象是人还是物。有一名小提琴演奏家在演出前调音的样子常常让我感到惊讶。即使手中的乐器是无价的珍宝，如斯特拉迪瓦里（Stradivarius）或瓜尔内里（Guarneri）这样的名琴，她也能非常自信地摆弄它。她会轻轻地把琴放在下巴和肩膀之间，松开双手，然后再去转动小提琴琴头的调音弦轴。其他人会害怕在那一刻的紧张中失手，把乐器摔下来，但这些专家对自己高超的技艺很放心。与他人一起工作需要相似的自信 —— 保持尊重而且有把握。

神经科学家迈克尔·格拉齐亚诺（Michael Graziano）研究个人空间已有数十年之久。他在 2018 年出版的《我们之间的空间》（The Spaces Between Us）一书的开篇中写道：

我们身边都有一个无形的、保护性的气泡。个人空间、安全边界、口臭区、躲闪与畏缩缓冲区 —— 无论你怎么称呼这个区域，它时刻都环绕在我们身边，就像一个力场一样。这个区域有很多层次，有些层次离我们的皮肤很近，就像紧身衣，还有些层次离得远一些，就像检疫帐蓬。大脑中的复杂网络监控着这些保护性的气泡，通过轻微地（有时是剧烈地）调整我们的行动，来保证这些气泡的安全。你可以走过一间杂乱的房间，轻松地在家具间穿行。在大街上，一只鸽子从你头顶上掠过，你就会赶紧躲开。与朋友比起来，你会站得离老板稍远一些，而你与爱人之间的距离会近得多。个人空间通常隐藏在意识的表面之下，偶尔也会被我们觉察到。它影响着人类体验的每一方面。

格拉齐亚诺指出，个人空间作为「第二层皮肤」的最初概念，是在 20 世纪 60 年代作为一种心理、社会现象发展起来的。爱德华·T. 霍尔（EdwardT.Hall）在 1966 年出版的《隐藏的维度》（The Hidden Dimension）一书中提出了「空间关系」（proxemics）的概念。霍尔用这个概念说明了「人类对空间的利用是一种文化的特殊表现形式」。霍尔的观点建立在动物生物学先驱海尼·黑迪格尔（Heini Hediger）的工作基础之上。黑迪格尔开创了「动物园生物学」—— 研究人类饲养的野生动物的科学。

黑迪格尔曾任苏黎世动物园的园长，他观察发现，在自然环境中的动物，会生活在相对较小的「领地气泡」内，这种「领地气泡」会跟随它们一起移动。他阐述了动物之间的不同互动距离。例如，逃跑距离是指动物在面对另一物种的动物靠近时能够忍受而不逃走的距离。临界距离是指逃跑距离与攻击距离（进入这个范围，被追赶的动物会转身开始进攻）之间的狭窄区域。个人距离与社交距离与同一种动物之间的互动有关。这些互动决定了动物在自身和群体中其他动物之间所保持的正常间距。

霍尔将这些观察的结果应用在了人类身上。虽然逃跑距离和临界距离基本上已经消失了，但个人距离和社交距离依然存在。他提出了四种距离 —— 亲密距离、个人距离、社会距离与公共距离。这些距离不是固定的，会随着情境而变化。它们划定了一个专属区域，一个你不希望他人进入的区域。霍尔是这样说的：「表现出我们称为‘领地意识'的行为，是动物（包括人类）的天性。通过这样的行为，它们能够用这种意识来区分一个个体与另一个个体之间的空间或距离。它们所选择的具体距离取决于互动，取决于互动个体之间的关系，以及它们的感受与行为。」

自 20 世纪 80 年代以来，实验神经科学界对个人空间的兴趣越来越浓厚。事实证明，身体周围的空间会在大脑中有一种特殊的表征。格拉齐亚诺自己的实验最先是在猴子身上做的，近年来才是在人身上做的。他的研究发现了一组极为复杂的特异化「多感官」神经元，这些神经元能让我们记住物体的位置，即使在黑暗中也是如此。他的研究表明，好几种行为（首先研究的是动物及其领地意识，后来对人类进行了社会性观察）原来都有一种神经科学的基础，直到现在才刚刚被人发现。格拉齐亚诺提到过一种「模拟气泡包装袋」，这是一种围绕在身体周围的、无形的第二层皮肤。这种「模拟气泡包装袋」使人重视身体附近的空间，同时也会注意到远处发生的事情。但是，与霍尔最初提出的概念不同，身体周围并不存在一层像巨大包裹一样的单一空间。每个身体部位似乎都有自己的「气泡」。这个系统让我们能通过视觉、听觉、触觉甚至记忆来随时关注物体的位置。该系统依赖于一组明确的大脑区域和一些具有精妙特性的特异化神经元。这个系统能将我们的感官整合在一起，形成一种对于身边物体的视、听、触觉雷达。

我们个人空间的作用机制并不只适用于人 —— 我们同样会将我们的工具纳入自己的近身缓冲区。正是通过这种方式，我们才能在用叉子或螺丝刀时「感觉」到它在做什么，并理解它周围的空间。格拉齐亚诺以吸尘器为例，解释了一个人如何监控吸尘器杆周围的空间，「以确保杆子不会碰到家具或门框、撞倒花瓶、弄伤猫或自己的腿」。他指出，要想熟练地使用工具，你就必须将其周围的空间考虑在内。似乎我们的大脑会将工具整合到身体图式中去，划定一个可调整的安全范围。这个安全范围能够扩张，环绕外界的物体。

这种现象有助于我们理解「准备工作」的重要性 —— 我们需要一个有序而熟悉的环境，让许多事情都能在预期之内。通过这样的安排，我们重新设置了自己的近身缓冲区，这样我们就能把精力集中在手头的工作上，而不必去试着适应我们周围的空间。

### 5.4 个人空间与表现

Personal space and performance

The need to navigate other people's personal space with sensitivity and skill is especially pressing in medicine. Clinicians work with patients, and this involves proximity, contact and physical examination. Experienced doctors negotiate this without even thinking about it. They have become comfortable not only with being close to people physically but with handling any part of a person's body. It's easy to lose sight of how difficult this skill is to acquire, though my experience with the trainee ophthalmologist brought it back. As a medical student, it took me a long time to learn how to move in and out of personal space without showing anxiety or embarrassment or transmitting that to my patients. I had to listen to their chests, palpate their abdomens, move their joints, peer into their eyes and ears. At first I felt acutely uncomfortable. But eventually this clinical touch became a natural part of every medical encounter.

Navigating personal space involves understanding how to respond. As a patient who has already experienced a clinical consultation, you know what to expect. There are conventions you've learned to recognize. It's like going to a classical music concert. There, you find your seat, sit quietly and wait for the performers to come on stage and begin. You don't break open a bottle of whisky, pass round bags of fried chicken, and start telling raucous jokes to the people in the row behind. And the rules are different at a football match or Glastonbury music festival.

These are unspoken patterns of behaviour which we have absorbed since childhood. When you go to the doctor, you know you may need to be examined, so you're not surprised when it happens. Yet entering a patient's personal space as a clinician is the equivalent of going into their house. Indeed, in any sphere of work where you deal with other people, you can't just barge in. You have to be invited. You have to show respect. If everyone takes their shoes off at the door, so should you.

Entering and leaving personal space with grace and respect requires practice. At first you may think that your own imperatives – to acquire information, say, or impress your teachers – take priority over the needs of your patient, colleague or customer. You may not think about their experience much at all, but instead focus upon yourself. Gradually, though, you start to shift from you to them, resetting your focus from yourself to the space between the two of you.

Working in personal space requires sensitivity and an ability to ‘read' people. Skilled professionals are able to enter and ‘inhabit' someone's personal space without causing discomfort or even much awareness. By being at ease in someone's personal space, you help to make them comfortable too. Experts make this look effortless, though everyone knows what an inept or ill-intentioned attempt feels like. It might be a waiter who looms over you, demanding your attention when you're not yet ready to order; or a colleague who stands behind you, reading what's on your computer screen while you type.

Fabrice the hairstylist learned this when he was an apprentice shampooing clients' hair. People are most aware of the personal space in front of them, because that's where they're looking. In the salon, things function differently. In order to work with their hair, Fabrice approaches his clients from the side or behind. They can see him in the mirror, of course, but he isn't directly confronting them. Approaching from the side, where the warning systems of personal space are less sensitive, makes connecting with someone much easier. Good waiters know this too. They don't approach diners directly but from the side, gauging and adjusting their distance as they read the tiny unconscious signals that show where the invisible boundary lies. That's what allows them to move in and out of personal space, reading the dynamics of each individual and group.

Many experts use an unthreatening preliminary manoeuvre to make contact and set the scene. For a hairstylist, that might be running their fingers through their client's hair. Joshua the tailor starts by walking round a customer, then explains that he needs to move closer to gauge the fit of the trousers or jacket. Sam Gallivan, a hand surgeon I work with, takes each patient's hand when they first meet in her clinic. During the usual shake, she holds on for a bit longer as they begin their conversation. After a few moments, she has assessed the range of movement in all the important joints of the patient's fingers and wrist without her patient even realizing it. And she has established a physical contact that sets the tone for the rest of the consultation.

Social and technical skills do not always go hand in hand, and their boundaries are not clear. Fabrice talks about colleagues who are brilliant at cutting and styling hair, yet lack the ease which keeps their clients coming back. Others are highly skilled at social interaction, but their technical and aesthetic powers are ordinary at best. Meanwhile Joshua speaks of cutting tailors whose social skills are outstanding, but whose suits are mediocre. And we've all encountered financial advisers who sound plausible but don't know much, or computer geeks who can fix any problem but won't look you in the eye. To become expert, you need both.

医学工作者尤其需要用敏感的觉察与技巧来对待他人的个人空间。临床医生要与患者一起工作，需要近距离接触患者，包括触碰和身体检查。有经验的医生无须思索就能成功处理这种事情。他们不仅在接近他人身体时游刃有余，而且在触碰人体的任何部位时都非常自然。我们很容易忽视这种技能是多么难以获取，不过我与那位实习眼科医生的经历让我想起了这一点。在上学期间，我花了很长时间来学习如何进出患者的个人空间，而不表现出焦虑、尴尬，或者把这种情绪传递给他们。我必须听他们的胸部、触摸他们的腹部、移动他们的关节、观察他们的眼睛和耳道。起初我觉得很不舒服，但最终，这种临床接触成了每次看病的自然组成部分。

进入个人空间需要明白如何做出应对。作为有就诊经历的患者，你知道会发生什么。有些惯例你已经熟悉了。这就像去听古典音乐会一样。到了音乐会，你要找到自己的座位，安静地坐着，等待表演者上台表演。你不会打开一瓶威士忌，和朋友分食一袋炸鸡翅，然后对后面一排的人讲粗俗的笑话。足球比赛与格拉斯顿伯里音乐节上的规矩是不同的。

这些不言而喻的行为模式是我们从小就学会的。你去看医生时，你知道你可能要做检查，所以在检查的时候你就不会感到惊讶。然而，临床医生进入患者的个人空间就相当于进入患者的房子。事实上，在任何与他人打交道的工作领域，你都不能随意闯入别人的个人空间。你必须得到邀请。你必须表现出尊重。如果每个人在进门前都要脱鞋，那你也应该脱鞋。

优雅和尊重地进入个人空间需要练习。一开始，你可能认为你的要紧事务（比如获取信息，或者给老师留下深刻印象）比患者、同事或顾客的需求更重要。你可能根本不会考虑他们的感受，而把关注点放在自己身上。不过，你会渐渐地把注意力从自己转移到他们身上，把关注点从自己身上移开，转移到你们之间的空间上。在个人空间里工作需要一定的敏感性和「阅读」他人的能力。熟练的专业人士能进入并停留在他人的个人空间，而不会引起不造，甚至不会引起太多注意。在别人的个人空间里感到自在，你也会帮助他人感到舒适。专家让这一点看起来毫不费力，但每个人都知道，如果进入你个人空间的人很笨拙或动机不纯，会给你带来什么感觉。这就好比在你还没有准备点餐的时候，某个服务员朝你逼近，向你唐突地提问；或者是一个同事站在你身后，在你打字时阅读你电脑屏幕上的内容。

发型设计师法布里斯在学徒时期为顾客洗头时学到了这一点。大家最能意识到自己面前的个人空间，因为他们在看向那里。在美发店里，事情却与此不同。为了打理顾客的头发，法布里斯会从侧面或后面接近他们。当然，顾客能从镜子里看见他，但他没有直接面对顾客。人侧面的个人空间警报系统不太敏感，所以从侧面接近更容易与人建立联结。优秀的服务员也知道这一点。他们不会从正面接近食客，而是从侧面接近。他们会一边解读细微的无意识信号 —— 这些信号表明了看不见的边界在哪儿，一边估计和调整自己的距离。这样一来，他们就能进出顾客的个人空间，解读每个个体与群体的关系动力。

许多专家会用一种没有威胁性的初步策略，来接触工作对象，做好工作准备。对于发型设计师来说，这可能是用手指捋一将顾客的头发。裁缝约书亚首先会绕着顾客走一圈，然后解释说他需要靠近一些，来测量裤子或上衣的长度。与我一起工作的手部外科医生萨姆·加利文（Sam Gallivan），每次在诊所里见到患者时都会与他们握手。在通常的握手过程中，她会多握一会儿，并且开始谈话。片刻之后，她就在患者没有意识到人的情况下，评估了患者手指和手腕所有重要关节的活动范围。她还与患者进行了身体接触，为接下来的问诊奠定了基础。

社交技能与专业技能并非总是同步发展的，它们之间的边界也并不明确。法布里斯谈到过一些同事，他们在剪发和发型设计方面才华横溢，但缺乏让顾客再次光临的轻松感。还有些同事擅长人际互动，但他们的专业技能和审美能力却平平无奇。同样地，约书亚也谈到过一些裁缝，他们的社交能力很出色，但设计的西装却很平庸。我们都见过说起话来头头是道却懂得不多的金融顾问，也见过能解决任何问题却不愿看你眼睛的技术人员。要成为专家，这两种能力你都需要。

### 5.5 触摸我的患者

Getting in touch with my patients

Within personal space, much is conveyed through touch. Confidence, assurance and concern, or roughness, indifference and ineptitude; we recognize these in an instant. Yet fluency in the language of touch can't be taken for granted. It has to be attended to, worked at, practised and perfected. In all fields, this is a challenge. As we've seen, touch is proximal and acts in two directions. It's a language you need to learn, but it doesn't have a dictionary.

When I was at medical school, none of my teachers said, ‘Roger, you need to learn how to enter and work within your patients' personal space, and to become fluent in the language of touch.' Nobody said that to Fabrice or Joshua either, and nobody explained it to Jozef when he started working in a team of chefs. We all absorbed these skills without realizing, as a by-product of other work. Those years of doing the bloods, chopping onions, sweeping the floor or measuring inseams helped us to develop the confidence to pass through someone's invisible second skin; to feel comfortable within their personal space and to make them comfortable in return. That took a long time for all of us. But we were aided in our efforts by having a system, a mise en place.

I'm back with Brenda and her newborn baby. It's the middle of the night, and I've almost finished suturing the episiotomy. I've found it stressful, though I've tried not to let that show. I know how important this repair will be for her and I want to do the best I can. I'm also becoming more confident in the two elements we've looked at – taking responsibility for my mise en place and working in someone's personal space. I've been aided on this occasion by experienced colleagues, essential members of the system I'm in. There was the midwife who showed me how to set out my trolley, and the nurse who talked to Brenda while I concentrated on my task.

I tie and cut the final suture, gather up my swabs and instruments, put the needles into a sharps bin, remove the green drapes and peel off my gloves. The midwife's scissor cut was expertly made and I've managed to close the perineal layers in the way I've been taught. Brenda's wound will heal up well. I help her out of the stirrups and make sure she's comfortable. Then I reassure her that it's all over and that everything's fine. ‘Thank you, Doctor,' Brenda says. ‘I hardly felt a thing. But now I'm so tired I'm going to have a sleep.'

I say goodbye and leave her to share her personal space with her new baby, then go back to bed and get some sleep before my pager goes off again. On this occasion, everything went smoothly. But things don't always go according to plan. In the next chapter, we'll look at those scary times when things go wrong.

在个人空间里，许多信息都是通过触摸传递的。信心、可靠与关心，或者粗暴、冷漠与无能。我们在片刻间就能感觉出来。然而，娴熟的触觉语言并不是轻易得来的。这种能力需要你留心、努力练习与完善。在所有领域，这都是一种挑战。正如我们所见，触摸是一种近距离的接触，具有双向作用。这是一门需要学习的语言，但没有关于它的字典。

在我上医学院的时候，没有老师说过：「罗杰，你得学会如何进入患者的个人空间，在那里面工作，还要熟练运用触摸的语言。」没有人对法布里斯和约书亚这么说，也没有人在约瑟夫开始在厨师团队里工作时向他解释过这一点。这些技能是其他工作的副产品，我们都在不知不觉间学会了这些东西。那些年的采血、切洋葱、扫地或量内缝的工作，帮助我们培养出穿过别人看不见的第二层皮肤的信心，也帮助我们培养出能在他人的个人空间里感到自如，同时也让他们感到舒服的信心。我们都花了很长时间才能做到这一点。但是，我们的努力都得到了一个系统、一种「准备工作」的帮助。

回到布伦达和她的新生儿身边。当时已经是深夜，会阴切开术的缝合已接近尾声。我的压力很大，不过我尽量不表现出来。我知道这次修复手术对她来说有多重要，我想尽力做到最好。我对这两个方面也更加自信了：为自己的「准备工作」负责，在别人的个人空间里工作。这一次，我得到了经验丰富的同事的帮助，他们是我所在的系统里的重要成员。助产士教会了我如何布置好手推车里的器械，护士在我专心工作时和布伦达讲话。

我打上结，剪断最后一根缝合线，收拾好我的棉签和器械，把针头放进利器箱里，取下绿色的手术巾，摘下手套。助产士的剪刀切口干净利落，我也成功地按照老师教的方法缝合了会阴层。布伦达的伤口会愈合得很好。我帮她把腿从腿架上放下来，确保她舒服地躺着。然后我向她保证一切都结束了，一切都很顺利。「谢谢你，医生，」布伦达说，「我几乎一点儿感觉都没有。可我现在太累了，我要睡一觉。」

我道了别，让她和刚出生的宝宝共享私人空间，然后回到了自己的床上，打算在呼机再次响起之前睡上一会儿。这一次，一切都很顺利，但事情并非总会按计划发展。在下一章里，我们会看到那些事情出错的可怕情况。

## 0601. 犯错与改正

0601 Getting it wrong and putting it right

One night at Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto, I start operating on Jonas, a young man who has been stabbed in the neck. I haven't been at Bara very long. To say I'm anxious would be an understatement. Neck wounds are notorious. A combination of spasm in an artery's wall and a temporary blood clot often stop the initial bleeding, and at first the damage doesn't seem too serious. This comforting sense of security disappears abruptly when you dislodge the clot and a pulsating fountain of blood hits you in the face. Before you know where you are, torrential bleeding swamps your view. If a major vessel like the carotid artery has been damaged, blood under pressure forces its way into the surrounding tissues, distorting everything. Boundaries between anatomical structures become obliterated and you lose your bearings. But if arteries are bad, veins are worse. Make a hole in one of those – their walls are paper-thin, so it's perilously easy to do – and an ominous whooshing gives you a second's warning that a tidal wave of blood is about to blot everything out. It's one of the most terrifying things that can happen.

With Jonas I'm picking my way through a morass of soggy tissue, trying to locate vital structures. As I probe and snip, I'm about to cut through some dreary-looking connective tissue. Something – I still don't know what – makes me stop and look again. I realize with a lurch that what I was about to divide is actually the internal jugular vein. This crucial vessel drains blood from the brain back to the heart, and cutting through it would be a disaster. A heart-stopping moment in every sense. I freeze, uncertain of what to do next. To gain time, I press hard with a swab and wait for my pulse to settle, thinking how close I just came to causing a catastrophe.

I try to summon my knowledge of neck anatomy. I should know it backwards. But I'm early in my surgical training and I haven't been operating solo for very long. The neck is scary territory at the best of times – even during a planned operation when you can see the tightly packed anatomy you've learned about from textbooks and in the dissecting room. But when someone has been stabbed, any certainty goes out of the window.

一天晚上，在索韦托的巴拉瓜纳医院，我开始给乔纳斯做手术。他的脖子被刺伤了。当时我来巴拉瓜纳医院的时间还不长。说「我感到焦虑」简直是轻描淡写。颈部受伤是出了名的棘手。颈动脉壁痉挛与临时产生的血块结合在一起，通常可以阻止最初的出血，而且起初看来，乔纳斯的伤口并不严重。一旦你移除血块，一阵一阵的血液像喷泉一样溅到你的脸上，这种令人安慰的安全感就突然消失了。在你弄清楚状况之前，如注的血流淹没了你的视野。如果像颈动脉这样的重要血管受损，血液会在血压的作用下进入周围的组织，让一切都变得扭曲起来。解剖结构之间的边界消失了，而你也会迷失方向。如果动脉状况不好，静脉就更糟糕了。要是在静脉上打个洞（静脉壁薄得像纸一样，所以极有这种可能性），一种不祥的嗖嗖声就会提前一秒给你警告：一股血浪马上就要涌出来染红一切。这是最可怕的事情之一。

给乔纳斯做手术，就像在湿软的沼泽里寻找出路，我试图找到重要的组织结构。我一边摸索一边剪，正要剪开一些看起来很可怕的结缔组织。某种原因（我现在依然不知道是什么原因）导致我停下来检查。我突然意识到，我正要剪开的东西其实是颈内静脉。这条重要的血管负责将血液从大脑运回心脏，剪断这条血管将是一场灾难。从任何意义上讲，这都是令人心悸的一刻。我呆住了，不知道接下来该做什么。为了争取时间，我用棉签用力按压，等待我的脉搏稳定下来，心想我差点儿酿成了一场灾难。

我努力回想我关于颈部解剖的知识。我应该倒背如流。但是，我的外科训练才开始不久，独立做手术的时间也不长。即使在理想的情况下，颈部也是个可怕的部位 —— 即使在计划好的手术中，在你能看到如同课本上和解剖室里学过的那些严密的解剖结构的情况下，也是如此。但如果有人被刀子捅了，就不存在任何确定性了。

### 6.1 单飞

Flying solo

Head and neck anatomy is unbelievably complicated; I wasn't alone in finding it confusing. In my first year as a medical student, I went to see our family doctor for something and mentioned I'd just started at medical school. He pulled down a pristine copy of Gray's Anatomy from his bookshelf and handed it to me. ‘Here,' he said, ‘you might as well have this – I won't need it. I never could learn the names of those little buggers in the neck. Still have nightmares about them. Good luck.' Soon, I found out exactly what he meant.

Years later, when I was teaching anatomy to medical students, I became more familiar with those little buggers in the neck. We spent a whole term on the head and neck. At last, I understood the ‘strap muscles' whose names seemed designed to confuse: sternohyoid, sternothyroid, omohyoid, thyrohyoid. I learned how the structures fitted into one another: the great arteries and veins taking blood to and from the brain; the nerves spreading out in all directions; the trachea taking air through the larynx to the lungs; and the treacherous oesophagus with its evil reputation as an unforgiving structure that was difficult to heal. Day after day, I guided groups of students through their dissections. By the end of that year, I had a pretty good idea about anatomy. I passed the primary exam for surgeons and felt smugly confident that those medical-school mists had dispersed. I'd memorized the names of all the little buggers and I knew exactly where to find them. At last, I knew it all. And it hadn't even been that difficult, really.

With Jonas on the operating table, I found out the difference between learning information and having knowledge. Anatomy in a living person is totally different from anatomy in a cadaver. I was way out of my depth, but there was no one to call on. I had to get on with it. I was flying solo and the stakes were real.

In this chapter we'll explore what happens when you're on the cusp between Apprentice and Journeyman. You've spent years on the early parts of the path I outlined in Chapter 1 . Until now, you've been learning to do things in the way they're done by others. You've been wrapped in a protective blanket. The people you work with know you'll make mistakes, because of your inexperience and lack of skill. As an Apprentice, you are at first only too aware of how little you know (the ‘conscious incompetence' I described in Chapter 3 ). Gradually, though, the technical difficulties start to recede. You're no longer having to use your full attention for everything, to concentrate so hard on what you're doing. You become more confident and you start to take things for granted. You are given licence to do more on your own. Eventually, you are on the verge of becoming independent, of moving into the Journeyman phase.

By this point you may think you know more than you actually do. You have become expert within the narrow compass of what your protected surroundings have allowed you to experience. Once those surroundings change, when you're out there on your own, you find you're up against challenges you didn't even know existed. Now you experience a different category of getting it wrong, one with serious consequences for all concerned. This is especially evident when the materials you work with are other people.

You can't help making mistakes – they're an inevitable part of becoming expert. When I started that operation on Jonas's neck I was beginning to take responsibility for my work, to lead operations on my own. But I was still wet behind the ears in terms of trauma surgery. Although I was gaining confidence, I didn't yet know how much I didn't know. All the experts I've worked with have similar stories of stopping just in time before something bad happens, of narrowly avoiding disaster.

Errors of this kind happen when you move from doing component tasks in someone else's workshop to taking responsibility for your work as a whole. That's the stage I'd reached when I was operating on Jonas. When you're at the limits of your competence and experience, but you have to carry on anyway, you're bound to make mistakes. Often, you notice in time and put it right. To improve, you have to expand the borders of your ability, and you'll only do that through work that stretches you. But sometimes bad things happen – work is damaged, people get hurt, your confidence is shattered.

Dealing with error involves interacting with people you may have disappointed in all kinds of ways. Fabrice the hairstylist describes these interactions in terms of psychological skills, as opposed to technical skills with scissors and comb. This chapter is about recognizing and responding when things are going wrong. No matter how many books you read, or how much advice people give you, you have to experience it for yourself. You have to learn to deal with that sick lurch when you realize you're on the verge of disaster. That's what happens when you go solo.

‘Flying solo' is a hackneyed shorthand for doing something on your own. But sometimes it's literal. While I was becoming a surgeon in Soweto, I learned to fly. It was a crazy thing to do but I loved it.

Every day as I drove to and from the hospital, I passed a tiny airfield next to the road. A battered sign said ‘Baragwanath Flying School'. One day, I went in. The flying school headquarters was a single-storey shack. One runway, no control tower, just a couple of tiny single-engine aeroplanes on the tarmac. It turned out that the school ran taster flights, where you could go up with an instructor for an hour to see if you liked it. I went up with Bill. A gruff, grizzled Afrikaner, he had been flying for decades and had seen it all. We took off in a two-seater, with me in the co-pilot's seat with its dual controls. Once we had gained some height, Bill pointed out the hospital below us and the skyline of Johannesburg in the distance. It was magical. Then he allowed me to fly the plane.

Of course, I wasn't really flying it – certainly not in the sense of taking any responsibility. But I was using the stick and the rudder, making the aircraft bank and turn; using my senses and learning about space and about other people. I had a glimpse of the mise en place of the cockpit and the other planes in the sky that we needed to avoid. Back on terra firma, I signed up for lessons on the spot.

The plane was a Cessna 152, one of the smallest you could get. It was like a second-hand car with wings, and its call sign was Kilo Sierra Lima (KSL). Over the next few months I came to know KSL extremely well. To begin with, all I did was ‘circuits and bumps'. Bill and I spent hours taking off and landing, again and again, not stopping after we'd touched down but opening the throttle and taking off for another ‘circuit'. I got to know that circuit by heart – a notional rectangle above the runway, each component with its technical name of crosswind leg, downwind leg, base leg and final approach. Time after time I went through the checklist procedures for taking off, gaining height, adjusting to the weather conditions, landing, then doing it all again. Crosswind landings. Flaps up, flaps down.

One day, after yet another set of take-offs and landings, Bill told me to stop. I thought I must have done something wrong and braced myself for a dressing-down. Instead, he got out of the cockpit and closed his door. ‘I'll be in the school building,' he said. ‘Let me know when you're back.' Before I'd realized quite what was happening, I'd taken off and was looking down at the flying school, this time on my own.

Everything changes when you're up there alone. All those lessons, that theory, those procedures become a blur. It's just you, and there's no Bill making tiny adjustments as you come in to land. But somehow things fell into place, I landed safely and brought KSL to a standstill. This moment occurs in the path of every expert. At a certain point, everybody has to stand on their own two feet.

After that, my confidence started to grow. I went out to the airfield on my own in the early mornings before work. I put in the hours I needed. I practised getting in and out of incipient spins and recovering from stalls. Eventually the day came for my flying test. The examiner put me through my paces. I showed I could take off on a short runway in a crosswind, navigate along a flight path, and make an emergency landing if the engine failed. I proudly received my Private Pilot Licence and couldn't wait to start using it.

Soon after that, I made a blunder that could have killed me and hundreds of others.

头部和颈部的解剖结构复杂到了难以置信的程度，我并不是唯一对此感到困惑的人。在我上医学院的第一年里，我去看我们的家庭医生，提到我刚刚开始上医学院。他从书架上抽出一本崭新的《格氏解剖学》（Gray's Anatomy）递给我。「拿着，」他说，「还是给你吧，我用不上了。我永远也记不住那些脖子里的小东西的名字。我到现在还会做有关它们的噩梦。祝你好运。」

很快，我就完完全全地明白了他的意思。

多年以后，我在给医学生讲授解剖学的时候，我对脖子里的小东西更加熟悉了。我们花了整整一学期的时间在头颈部。最后，我弄懂了那些「带状肌」，这些名称似乎是故意让人混淆的：胸骨舌骨肌、胸骨甲状肌、肩胛舌骨肌、甲状舌骨肌。我了解了这些结构是如何相互配合的：大动脉和大静脉将血液送至和送出大脑，神经向四面八方扩散，气管将空气经由喉部送到肺部，还有难以捉摸的食道 —— 它是出了名的难伺候，一旦受伤很难愈合。我日复一日地指导学生做解剖。到了那年年底，我对解剖学有了相当不错的了解。我通过了外科医生的初级院士考试，沾沾自喜地以为医学院的苦日子终于到头了。我已经记住了所有那些小东西的名字，也知道它们的确切位置。终于，我全都懂了。事实上，这并没有那么困难。

站在乔纳斯的手术台边，我发现了学会信息和拥有知识之间的区别。活人的解剖结构与尸体的截然不同。这件事超出了我的能力范围，但我没有人可以求助。我必须硬着头皮做下去。我已经独当一面了，面临的风险是真真切切的。

在本章中，我们将探讨你在学徒与熟练工的交界处会遇到的事情。你已经花了多年时间在第 1 章概述的早期道路上跋涉。到目前为止，你一直在学习别人做事的方式。你被包裹在一个保护罩里。和你一起工作的人知道你会犯错，因为你缺乏经验和技能。作为一名学徒，一开始你很清楚自己所知甚少（即我在第 3 章中描述过的「有意识的无能」）。不过，技能上的困难会逐渐消退。你不再需要全神贯注地做每件事情，努力把精力集中在你手头的事上。你变得更加自信，开始习惯事情的常态。

你可以独立做更多的事情了。最后，你来到了独立的边缘，准备进入「熟练工」阶段。

这时，你可能认为自己知道的比实际上更多。在受保护的环境所允许的狭窄范围内，你已经成为专家。一旦那些环境发生变化，当你独当一面的时候，你会发现你面对的挑战是自己以前从未意识到的。你会有一种不同的犯错体验，这种错误会给所有相关的人带来严重的后果。如果你的工作对象是其他人，这一点尤其明显。

你无法避免犯错 —— 犯错是成为专家的必经之路。我在给乔纳斯的脖子动手术时，已经开始为自己的工作负责了，独立担任主刀医生。但是，在创伤外科方面，我还很稚嫩。虽然我越来越有信心，但我还不知道我有多少不知道的东西。与我打过交道的所有专家都有类似的经历：在糟糕的事情发生之前及时停下来，侥幸逃过灾难。

当你不再在别人的工坊里负责部分任务，而开始为整体工作负责时，就会犯这样的错误。这就是我在给乔纳斯做手术时所处的阶段。你已经达到了自己能力与经验的极限，却不得不继续推进，你必然会犯错。通常情况下，你会及时发现并纠正错误。为了提高自己，你必须扩大自己的能力范围，而你只能通过挑战自己来做到这一点。有时糟糕的事情会发生 —— 工作搞砸了，有人受伤了，你的信心也受到了打击。

处理错误，需要你和出于各种原因而对你失望的人打交道。发型设计师法布里斯认为这些互动需要心理技能，而不是用剪刀和梳子的专业技能。这一章讲的就是在事情出错时你要如何识别并做出反应。无论你读过多少书，或者别人给了你多少建议，你都必须亲身体验。你必须学会在意识到自己面临灾难时如何应对那种难受的、心中一惊的感觉。这就是你在「单飞」时会遇到的事情。

「单飞」是独立做某件事的简略说法，但有时它就是字面上的意思。我在索韦托学做外科医生的时候，学会了开飞机。这是一件疯狂的事情，但我很喜欢。

每天我开车前往和离开医院的路上，都会经过一座小机场。一块破破烂烂的牌子上写着「巴拉瓜纳飞行学校」。有一天，我进去了。这所飞行学校的总部是一间单层的棚屋。这里只有一条跑道，没有控制塔，还有几架小型单引擎飞机停在停机坪上。原来这里开设了试航课程，你可以跟教练一起飞上一个小时，看看自己是否喜欢。我和比尔一起去了试航。比尔是一个性情粗鲁、头发花白的南非白人，几十年来一直在开飞机，见多识广。我们开的是一架双座飞机，我坐在副驾驶的位置上，也有一套控制系统。我们爬升到一定高度时，比尔指给我看下面的医院和远方约翰内斯堡的轮廓。这种感觉很奇妙。然后他允许我来开飞机。

当然，我不是真的在开飞机 —— 显然我不必承担任何责任。但是我在操作操纵杆和方向舵，让飞机倾斜和转向；我在运用自己的感官，了解空间与他人。我领略了驾驶舱内的「准备工作」，也瞥见了天空中我们需要避开的其他飞机。回到坚实的陆地上后，我立即报名参加了课程。

那架飞机的型号是塞斯纳 152，是你能找到的最小的飞机之一。它就像一辆有机翼的二手车，它的呼号是 KSL，即基洛·谢拉·利马（Kilo Sierra Lima）。在接下来的几个月里，我对 KSL 变得非常了解。一开始，我只能做「绕圈与降落」。

比尔和我花了好几个小时练习起飞和降落，一遍又一遍。我们在着陆后没有停下来，而是打开节气门，起飞做另一次「绕圈」。我对绕圈的线路已经烂熟于心了 —— 跑道上方的一个假想的长方形，每条边都有专门的名称，如二边、三边、四边和五边。

我一次又一次地按步骤起飞、爬升、适应天气状况、降落，然后再做一遍。侧风着陆。打开襟翼，放下襟翼。

有一天，在又一次起飞和降落之后，比尔让我停下来。我想我一定是做错了什么，准备挨一顿骂。然而，他走出驾驶舱，关上了舱门。「我去教学楼里，」他说，「你回来时告诉我一声。」

我还没有意识到发生了什么，就已经起飞了。我俯视着飞行学校，这次我是独自一人。当你在天上独自一人的时候，一切都变了。所有的课程、理论、操作步骤都变得模糊起来。天上只有你自己，在降落时不会有比尔做微小的调整。但不知为何，一切都很顺利，我安全着陆了，让 KSL 稳稳地停了下来。在每个人成为专家的道路上都会有这一时刻。从某个时间点起，每个人都得自力更生。

从那以后，我的信心开始增长。清晨上班前，我会一个人前往机场。我花了足够的时间积累。我练习了进入和改出初始螺旋状态，并从失速中恢复。终于到了我飞行测试的那天。考官考查了各项科目。我展示了侧风短跑道起飞，沿航线飞行，并且在引擎故障的情况下緊急迫降。我自豪地获得了私人飞机驾驶执照，并迫不及待地想使用它。

不久之后，我犯了一个可能会害死自己和几百个其他人的错误。

### 6.2 纠正错误

Recovering from error

Everyone makes errors. Nobody sets out to make them, but that's how life is and that's how we learn. So far in the book we've looked at practising your craft within a setting which protects you and has safeguards against too much harm. Fabrice started by shampooing, and Joshua began with pocket flaps. I didn't leap in by operating on stab wounds to the neck. I started with straightforward clinical procedures, like taking blood. As a medical student and a junior doctor, there were always people I could call on – though in the culture of the time I didn't unless I had no choice. But everyone knew I was learning and they made allowances. If I was really stuck I could call for help, and the only damage would be to my pride.

But there comes a point when you have to take direct responsibility for your work. You fetch up against the consequences of that work, especially when its focus is other people. You are having to make decisions in a world which no longer makes allowances for your mistakes. You chose to go there, and you have to deal with it.

Sometimes you find yourself out of your depth, your usual landmarks erased. Sometimes, as I discovered in that operation on Jonas's stabbed neck, you stop on the edge of disaster. But sometimes you don't stop, and bad things happen.

It's how you learn from your mistakes that counts. That's easy enough to say, but it's difficult to cope with when you damage someone else through your inexperience or inattention. Not all my own mistakes were medical. For one of my more spectacular blunders we'll go back to Baragwanath Flying School, where my first major error was nearly my last.

Soon after I got my pilot's licence, I took off in KSL on a short hop to Rand Airport. Rand was one of several large airports in Johannesburg but I'd never been there before. My flying school was so small it didn't have a control tower, and I wanted to practise flying to somewhere larger. My instructor Bill told me, ‘You can't miss Rand Airport. Just turn left at the silver water tower soon after take-off and you'll see the runway ahead of you.'

I took off, saw the silver water tower and turned left. At first I couldn't spot the airport, so I kept going for a bit longer. Eventually I saw a sizeable runway. Although it was a little to one side of where I was expecting, I radioed Rand Airport tower, got clearance and landed. The runway seemed very long as I was taxiing along it, but it was only when I passed a row of jumbo jets and a sign saying ‘Welcome to Johannesburg International Airport' that I realized I'd landed unannounced at one of the continent's busiest airports instead of the one I was aiming for. Soon after that my radio crackled into life, with a furious voice barking ‘Kilo Sierra Lima, Kilo Sierra Lima, do you read me?'

I parked my little Cessna in front of the tower, then spent the next half hour in a most uncomfortable interview with the air traffic controller and his team. By sheer luck it had been a quiet afternoon, with no passenger aircraft scheduled to take off or land. If I'd come down in the path of an incoming airliner I could have caused a catastrophic crash, killing myself and a planeload of others.

The only reason I wasn't crucified was that the tower crew had relaxed their normal vigilance and hadn't noticed me coming until I'd actually landed. Red faces all round. Although the primary fault was mine, the safety net that should have picked up my mistake early had failed too. So after a severe dressing-down I was allowed to get back into KSL, much chastened, and fly back to Baragwanath airfield.

As soon as I landed, I told Bill what I had done. Bill was not known for his sensitivity and I braced myself for a tirade. But to my astonishment he burst into laughter, took me into a private room, produced a bottle from somewhere, poured us both a glass and started to tell me about the time he wrote off a twin-engine plane by forgetting to put down the undercarriage. More stories followed and I realized that, by making my mistake, I had moved one step nearer the centre of a community of practice. I'd joined the company of pilots who had made errors they didn't normally talk about; people who know that error is inevitable but who only tell you about theirs when you've made one yourself – just like surgeons.

Bill didn't minimize the seriousness of my mistake. It could have been horrendous, and it was sheer luck that I didn't cause a major disaster. But he realized that I needed to use that experience to become a better pilot, not let it make me lose my nerve so I never flew again.

人人都会犯错。没有人愿意犯错，但这就是生活的真相，也是我们学习的方式。到目前为止，我们在本书中讨论的是在一个保护你的环境中练习你的技艺，防止你造成太大的损害。在最开始的时候，法布里斯只需要给客人洗头，而约书亚只用制作袋盖。我也不会一开始就给脖子上的刺伤动手术。我从最简单的临床操作做起，比如采血。在做医学生和实习医生的时候，总有我可以求助的人 —— 不过在当时的环境氛围里，不到万不得已，我是不会求助的。每个人都知道我在学习，他们对我有一定的宽容。如果我真的陷入了困境，我可以求助，唯一受损的只有我的自尊。

但是总有一天，你必须对自己的工作负直接责任。你要直面工作的后果，尤其是在工作的重心是其他人的情况下。你必须在一个不再宽容你犯错的世界里做决定。这是你自己的选择，你必须面对。

有时你会发现自己力不从心，平常熟悉的参照物已不复存在。有时候，就像我在手术台旁面对乔纳斯脖子上的刺伤一样，你也会在酿成大错之前停下来。但有时你停不下来，糟糕的事情就会发生。

重要的是你如何从错误中学习。这说起来很容易，但当你因为经验不足或注意力不集中而伤害到别人时，你就很难应对了。并非我所有的错误都与医学有关。要说起我犯的一个很严重的错误，就得回到巴拉瓜纳飞行学校。在那里，我犯下的第一个严重错误，几乎就成了我这辈子犯的最后一个错误。

我拿到飞机执照后不久，就 KSL 飞往不远的兰德机场。兰德机场是约翰内斯堡的几个大型机场之一，但我从没去过那儿。我的飞行学校很小，连控制塔都没有，所以我想去更大的地方练习飞行。教练比尔告诉我：「兰德机场绝对不容错过。起飞不久后在银色水塔处左转，你就能看到前方的跑道。」

我起飞了，看到了银色水塔就向左转。起初我找不到机场，于是又向前飞了一段。最后我看到了一条相当宽敞的跑道。不过这条跑道有些偏向一侧，和我想的不太一样，我用无线电通知了兰德机场控制塔，得到了许可，然后降落了。跑道似乎很长，我沿着跑道滑行。我经过了一排喷气式飞机，看到一个标志上写着「欢迎来到约翰内斯堡国际机场」，这时我才意识到我未经知会就降落在了这片陆地最繁忙的机场上，而不是我原本的目的地。很快我的无线电响了起来，一个愤怒的声音喊道：

「基洛·谢拉·利马，基洛·谢拉·利马，你能听到吗？」

我把我的小塞斯纳飞机停在了控制塔前，然后花了半个小时与空中交通管制员和他的团队进行了一次非常难堪的访谈。

非常幸运的是，当天下午机场并不繁忙，没有一架客机要起飞或降落。如果我在一架飞机的行进路线上降落，可能就会造成灾难性的事故，害死我自己和对面飞机上的其他人。

我没有受到严惩的唯一原因是，控制塔上的工作人员也放松了警惕，直到我着陆时才注意到我。周围的每个人都气冲冲的。虽然主要责任在我，但本应及早发现我犯错的安全保障措施也失效了。所以，在接受严厉的训斥之后，我更加警醒了，他们允许我回到 KSL，飞回巴拉瓜纳机场。

一下飞机，我就告诉了比尔我所做的事情。照顾别人的感受不是比尔的长项，我准备好接受他喋喋不休的训斥了。可让我惊讶的是，他却哈哈大笑起来，把我带进一间私人房间，不知从哪儿拿出一瓶酒，给我们俩各倒上一杯，讲起了他有一次因为忘记放下起落架而毁掉一架双引擎飞机的故事。然后他又讲了更多的故事，而我意识到，由于犯了错误，我朝着实践社群的中心又迈进了一步。我加入了老练飞行员的行列，他们都犯过一些通常不愿谈论的错误，他们知道错误是不可避免的，但只有在你犯了错误之后才会告诉你他们的错误 —— 就像外科医生一样。

比尔并没有淡化我的错误的严重性。这件事可能会带来可怕的后果，幸运的是我没有酿成大祸。但他知道我需要利用这段经历来成为一名更好的飞行员，而不是让这件事浇灭我的勇气，以至于再也不敢飞行。

### 6.3 剖析错误

Dissecting error

Although technically categorized as a ‘near miss', my error with KSL was way beyond the ‘normal' margin of error that beginners find themselves in. Nothing like it had ever happened at that airport – no aircraft would ever arrive at a large airport like that without making radio contact long before coming into view. Because my mistake was so egregious, it had never occurred to me or anyone else that it might even happen. The control tower team and I were both working within what we were expecting, and the unfamiliar floored us. I was focusing on my procedures for landing, without asking if I was at the right place. It was the aviation equivalent of doing a perfect operation on the wrong patient.

My near misses in surgery were of a different kind. These were caused by finding myself in unfamiliar terrain and not knowing what to do. When I was operating on Jonas, I found it impossible to recognize the usual landmarks. I'd operated on the neck before, but now the neck looked different.

Another night at Bara I was operating on a patient with penetrating chest and abdominal wounds. I didn't even know his name at the time, as he was almost dead from blood loss when he arrived. We had to take him straight to theatre. As I finished dealing with his abdominal injuries, his condition plummeted and I realized I had to go into his chest. The knife that stabbed him must have been a long one as there was bleeding from the great vessels near the heart. I hadn't seen much thoracic surgery, let alone done any, and yet again I was way outside my comfort zone. But there was no alternative, so I carried on.

Thoracic surgery is a specialized field and needs specialized instruments. After opening the chest, I found that blood was hosing from one of the large vessels to the lung. I could see where it was coming from, and I needed to stop it fast if my patient was to survive.

In this kind of emergency you can't take your eye off the site of injury, and your scrub nurse plays a vital role by putting what you need into your hand. On this occasion, the nurse with me hadn't done much thoracic surgery either. I asked for an angled clamp to control the bleeding, held out my hand and felt the instrument's handle hit my palm. I was just about to place it across the fragile vessel when I realized that, instead of the soft vascular clamp I was expecting, she had given me a bronchial clamp. This has murderous spikes in its jaws, designed to grasp the stiff cartilage of the air passages. It would have cut the delicate pulmonary vessels to shreds. To this day, I can feel the pounding of my heart as I realized what a narrow escape my patient and I had both just had.

My near misses in the operating theatre and in the air have similarities and differences. Thinking back to when I arrived unannounced at Johannesburg International Airport, I can identify several classic types of blunder. Landing at the wrong airport was an error through simple inexperience. The weather was fine; there was no obvious problem. I should have known better, but I didn't have the experience to recognize key signals and respond appropriately. I just hadn't learned enough. When I took off from Baragwanath airfield I was using my attentional capacity to fly the plane, talk on the radio and look out for the silver water tower. I didn't have a clear sense of where I was going, and I hadn't been there before. I took the advice of people who were more experienced than I was, people who assumed my knowledge was like theirs. For them, ‘turn left at the silver water tower' told them all they needed to know. But what I needed to know was what to do after turning left. It didn't occur to me that there might be more than one airport in the vicinity. Though I'd studied the aerial charts until I was sick of them while I was swotting for my Private Pilot Licence, I hadn't made the connection.

On top of that, I was anxious. When I did see a runway, I was so relieved that I jumped to the conclusion that it was the right one, even though it wasn't exactly where I expected. Instead of questioning my assumptions, I over-focused on landing the plane. This ties in with Daniel Kahneman's System 1 and System 2 thinking. In my case, I worked according to System 1 – the fast, automatic way – when I should have been using System 2, the painstaking effortful approach which analyses factors systematically.

It is frighteningly easy to make assumptions. In surgical training you spend a long time learning anatomy, mostly from textbooks. This is highly detailed knowledge and it provides a reassuring sense of certainty. But that certainty can be illusory. You think in terms of ‘a gastrectomy' (removing the stomach) – of descriptions you have seen in books and other patients you have been involved with. But you can't know what this patient's stomach will be like until you see it for yourself.

In Chapter 4 I described the need to look, really look, at what's in front of you, rather than seeing what you expect to find. As my experience in the air showed me, when you're feeling vulnerable – uncertain, out of your depth, tired, and all the other things the books don't mention – this is the very time when you need to take note of warning signs and not just plough on. Luckily, that's what I did with Jonas as I was about to divide his internal jugular vein. But sometimes you are forced out of your comfort zone because the circumstances are beyond your control. You find yourself in territory you wouldn't have chosen and you cannot avoid. If you're lucky you can call for help, but often you just have to deal with it.

Error has a bad name, but it's both important and unavoidable. The challenge is not to eliminate it but to minimize the damage it causes. There's a difference between ‘bad error' (those harmful mistakes that should have been avoided) and ‘honourable error' (when you try something and it doesn't work). There's no shame in honourable error. On the contrary, it's how people move forward. Error then becomes something to learn from, something to be experienced, corrected and reshaped, rather than avoided altogether. Nobody sets out to make mistakes, but learning from error is an essential part of becoming expert. It's how you improve. Error and failure are not the same.

虽然严格来讲，这次属于「未遂事故」，但我驾驶 KSL 所犯的错误远远超出了初学者犯错的「正常」范围。那座机场里从没发生过类似的事情 —— 没有一架飞机能直接降落在一座大型机场，而不在进入视线范围前早早地用无线电联络。由于我的错误太严重了，我和其他人都没想过会发生这样的事情。控制塔团队和我都在按计划做事，这种不熟悉的情况让我们措手不及。我只想着降落的步骤，而没有考虑我是否降落在了正确的地点。这就好比在错误的患者身上做了一台完美的手术。

我在手术中的「未遂事故」与此不同。这些「未遂事故」的原因是我发现自己处在陌生的情况里，不知道该做什么。在给乔纳斯做手术时，我无法辨认出熟悉的参照物。我以前做过颈部手术，但现在乔纳斯的脖子看起来完全不同。

在巴拉瓜纳医院的另一个晚上，我在给一个胸部有穿透伤，腹部也有伤口的患者做手术。当时我连他的名字都不知道，因为他到医院时已经因为失血过多而奄奄一息了。我们只好直接把他送进手术室。我刚处理完他腹部的伤口，他的情况就急转直下，我意识到我必须做开胸手术。刺伤他的那把刀一定很长，因为靠近心脏的大血管正在出血。我没见过多少胸外科手术，更别提动手做了，我又一次离开了自己的舒适区。但我别无选择，只能迎难而上。

胸外科是一个专业的领域，做手术需要专门的器械。打开胸腔之后，我发现血液正在从一根连接肺部的大血管里喷涌而出。我能看到出血的位置，如果想要患者活下来，我就需要迅速止血。

在这种紧急情况下，你必须目不转睛地盯着伤处，你的洗手护士则要扮演重要的角色，把你需要的东西放在你的手上。

在当时，与我合作的护士也没有做过多少胸外科手术。我想要一个弯的夹钳来止血，我伸出手去，感到夹钳的手柄拍在了我的手掌上。我正要用夹钳去夹脆弱的血管，这时我才意识到，护士给我的不是我想要的软血管钳，而是支气管钳。这种夹钳的钳口上有尖利的刺，是用来夹呼吸道里较硬的软骨的。它会把脆弱的肺血管夹碎。时至今日，我依然能感觉到我在意识到患者死里逃生、我险些酿成大错时的心跳。

我在手术室内与驾驶飞机时的「未遂事故」既有相似也有不同。回想起我未经知会就降落在约翰内斯堡国际机场时的场景，我能找出几种典型的错误。降落在错误的机场纯粹是由于缺乏经验造成的错误。当时天气很好，没有明显的问题。我应该做得更好，但我没有识别关键信号并做出适当反应的经验。我学得还不够。我从巴拉瓜纳机场起飞时，把全部注意力都放在了驾驶飞机、无线电通话和寻找银色水塔上。我不清楚我要去哪儿，我以前没去过那里。我听取了一些比我更有经验的人的建议，他们以为我的经验与他们相当。对他们来说，只需要知道「到了银色水塔处左转」就足够了，但我需要知道左转之后该做什么。我没有想到附近会有不止一座机场。虽然在备考私人飞机驾驶执照时，我一直在研究航空图，直到不胜其烦，但我没有意识到这一点。

最重要的是，我当时很焦虑。当我看到跑道时，我如释重负，草率地认为我到达了正确的机场，但事实出乎了我的意料。我没有质疑自己的假设，而是过于关注飞机的降落。这种情况与丹尼尔·卡尼曼所说的系统 1 与系统 2 思维有关。在我的例子里，我在按照系统 1（快速的、自动化的方式）工作，但我实际上应该使用系统 2（全面分析各项因素的、勤勉、努力的方式）。

做假设是非常容易的。在外科训练中，你要花很长时间学习解剖学，主要是从课本上学习。这是非常详细的知识，提供了一种令人安心的确定性，但这种确定性可能是虚幻的。你脑子里全是「胃切除术」（切除胃部的手术）这样的术语 —— 你想到的是书中的描述，以及你接触过的其他患者。但如果你不亲自去见识，就不知道眼前这位患者的胃是什么样子。

在第 4 章中，我谈到了「看」，真正的「看见」你眼前的东西，而不是只看到你希望发现的东西。我开飞机的经历告诉我，你感到脆弱的时候 —— 感到不确定、力不从心、疲惫以及所有其他书里没提到的感觉时，正是你需要注意报警信号而不是埋头苦干的时候。幸运的是，我在给乔纳斯做手术时正是这样做的，我差点就切开了他的颈内静脉。有时你会被迫离开自己的舒适区，因为环境是你无法控制的。你会发现自己置身于不愿选择、无法回避的境地。如果你够幸运，就可以向人求助，但通常你只能独立应对。

错误看似很糟糕，但它既重要又不可避免。我们面临的挑战不是消除错误，而是将它造成的损害降到最低。「糟糕的错误」与「可敬的错误」是有区别的。前者是指那些本可以避免的有害错误，而后者是指你尝试了某些事情却失败了。「可敬的错误」并不可耻。相反，这是大家进步的方式。这样一来，错误就变成了需要学习、体验、纠正和重塑的东西，而不是需要彻底避免的东西。没有人以犯错为目标，但从错误中学习是成为专家的必经之路。这是你进步的方式。错误与失败不是一回事。

### 6.4 假设的危险

The danger of making assumptions

At around the time I was landing at the wrong airport, Fabrice the hairstylist was starting with his last client of the day in the salon where he was completing his training. The pressure was on to finish quickly so that the salon could close on time. By now Fabrice had gained a lot of technical skill. He was expert with scissors and comb, with handling different kinds of hair. After years of apprenticeship he hardly had to think about what he was doing, and he could keep up a conversation on autopilot while he worked.

On this occasion, his client was a middle-aged woman with shortish hair. Partway through, he suddenly realized that he'd cut the hair on her crown too short. Hairstylists have a saying, ‘When it's too short, it's too late'; that day, Fabrice had that sinking feeling I'd experienced many times in the operating theatre.

To an outsider, hairstyling seems to be about technique, about shaping and snipping. In fact, the most important part is design. Everyone's hair grows differently and those growth patterns are crucial, especially on the crown. If you get that wrong you'll create something that may look reasonable at first but quickly becomes distorted as the hair grows. It's especially challenging with shorter hair, where even a millimetre can make a huge difference.

Fabrice had made an unforced error and now he had to handle it. Building on the relationship he had developed with this client over previous visits, he was straightforward. ‘I've made it a little shorter than we planned,' he said, ‘and perhaps I misjudged the growth pattern. In two weeks' time it should be fine, but today it will look a bit shorter than you expected. Will you be OK with that?' The client wasn't pleased, but she accepted Fabrice's explanation. The next time she made an appointment she even insisted on being styled by him again.

Fabrice made that mistake through overconfidence. Relying on the techniques he was beginning to master, he overlooked the need to check and recheck whether he was doing the right thing. Later, he discovered that all stylists make errors of this kind, even when they are extremely experienced. Fabrice had become part of a community of stylists who had made errors. Even the most famous are not immune. The fashion designer Mary Quant once described having her hair cut by the iconic stylist Vidal Sassoon in the 1960s. ‘One night,' Quant recalled, ‘[he] was cutting my hair to promote his new five-point geometric bob, in the presence of various Press photographers. Spurred on by the vast audience, he went whap! – and cut my ear. Just the fat bit – and nothing bleeds more.'

Joshua the tailor made mistakes at this stage of his career too. When he'd just finished his second apprenticeship and was starting to work as a qualified tailor, he deliberately sought out challenging customers in order to gain experience. One of these was a man who suffered a physical disability and had an unusual body shape. He and Joshua decided on a design for his suit, then Joshua began a series of fittings. By the third fitting he discovered that things were getting worse, not better.

Joshua was skilled in making suits for average-looking people, but he didn't yet have the experience to deal with outliers. He realized that he'd never be able to make the successful suit he had in mind by tinkering with what he'd created so far. His fundamental design, based on a man of more usual proportions, was an error. Bravely, he decided to scrap what he'd done, go back to the beginning and start again from scratch. He was able to use what he'd learned from that false start to come up with a different design. In the end, the suit was a success, and the customer was delighted. But Joshua had to recognize when his situation needed a radical rethink rather than fiddling. He'd had to write off everything he had done so far – the materials, the work of the making tailors, his time and his customer's time – and that took guts. But his priority was to do the best work possible, and he could only do that by starting again. So Joshua moved out of the frame he had been working in – the approaches he'd been taught and the assumptions he'd grown used to – and set up a different one. This is difficult to do, but it's an essential part of improving. That ability to change frames is a marker of becoming expert.

I experienced something similar after I'd been a GP for several years. One of my patients came to see me because she was tired. Bethany was in her forties, with a family and a busy career. There was nothing specific in her history apart from some indigestion. I arranged a blood test which confirmed that she was anaemic, so the next step was to find out why. I had a niggling worry that there might be something more serious going on, as I'd known Bethany for years and she didn't look quite right. So, because of the indigestion, I referred her to a gastroenterologist. He arranged various tests including an endoscopy (passing a flexible tube into the stomach and another into the rectum), and all the results came back normal. He reassured Bethany that nothing was wrong. But a few months later she saw me again because her tiredness was getting worse.

Although the hospital consultant had given her the green light, I realized that was only from his perspective as a specialist. When he said there was nothing wrong, he meant nothing wrong with her digestive system – not that there was nothing wrong at all. As a GP, my job was to step back and think whether we'd been asking the right questions. Maybe her problem was not with her digestive system but another part of her body altogether.

In the end, it turned out that Bethany had an early cancer of the uterus. Luckily, we caught it in time and she was fine, but I could easily have missed it. It is surprisingly easy to start down a path from the initial framing of a problem and stay within that set of assumptions. I had to learn to stop, rewind and think again – to check whether I was treating the right problem.

I'm sure we've all made errors through assumption, treating a symptom rather than its cause. When a light goes out in the house, your immediate response is to change the bulb. But when that bulb blows too, you have to look for a different explanation. It happened with the battered old Morris Minor van I used to drive as a student. One day it coughed and died by the side of the road. The petrol gauge said ‘Full', so I knew that couldn't be the problem. I called the roadside rescue service and the first thing the mechanic did was pour in some petrol from a can. The car started without a murmur and I felt like a complete idiot. It turned out that my petrol gauge was faulty and had stuck on ‘Full'.

就在我降落在错误机场的时候，发型设计师法布里斯在他学艺的美发店里，正准备给当天的最后一位客人服务。他感到有些压力，因为要尽快完工，这样美发店才能按时关门。此时法布里斯已经掌握了许多专业技能。他擅长使用剪刀和梳子，擅长处理不同类型的头发。经历了多年的学徒生涯，他几乎不用思考自己在做什么，可以在工作的同时与人自如地交谈。

这一次，他的客人是一位短发的中年妇女。剪到一半，他突然发现他把客人头顶上的头发剪得太短了。发型设计师常说：「剪得太短，为时已晚。」那天，法布里斯有了一种我在手术室里体验过多次的沉重感。

在外行人看来，发型设计好像是关乎技术的，关乎造型与修剪。事实上，最重要的部分是设计。每个人的头发都长得不一样，这种生长的模式是至关重要的，尤其是头顶的头发。如果你不顺应这种规律，就会剪出一些看起来很合理的发型，但很快就会随着头发的生长而变形。对于较短的发型来说，这一点尤其具有挑战性，即使一毫米的偏差也能产生巨大的影响。法布里斯出现了失误，现在他必须处理这个错误。他之前与这位客人建立了一定的关系，于是他直言不讳。「我剪得比预计的短了些，」他说，「可能我看错了头发的生长模式。两周后应该就没问题了，但今天头发会看起来比您预想的要短一些。您可以接受吗？」客人不太满意，但她接受了法布里斯的解释。下次预约时，她甚至坚持要法布里斯来给她剪发。

法布里斯犯这种错误的原因是过度自信。由于过度依赖自己逐渐掌握的各项技能，他忘记了应该反复检查自己做得是否正确。后来他发现，所有发型设计师都会犯这种错误，即使经验非常丰富的人也不例外。法布里斯成了犯过错误的发型设计师社群中的一员。即使最著名的发型设计师也不能幸免。时装设计师玛丽·奎恩特（Mary Quant）曾讲过著名发型设计师维达·沙宣（Vidal Sassoon）在 20 世纪 60 年代给自己剪发的经历。「一天晚上，」奎恩特回忆道，「他当着各路摄影记者的面给我剪发，宣传他新设计的‘五点几何波波头'。在大批观众的刺激下，他大刀阔斧地剪了下来 —— 剪到了我的耳朵。剪到了肉最多的那部分，我从没流过这么多血。」

裁缝约书亚在职业生涯的这个阶段也犯过错误。当时他刚刚结束自己的第二次学徒生涯，成为一名有资质的裁缝。他故意寻找有挑战性的顾客，以积累经验。其中一位顾客是残疾人，他的体型很不寻常。他和约书亚决定了西装的款式，然后开始试穿。在第三次试穿时，约书亚发觉衣服变得更不合身了，而不是更合身。

约书亚擅长为普通人制作西装，但还没有与这类身材不同寻常的人工作的经验。他意识到，他不可能把现在这件西装修改成他想象中的样子。他的设计是以更常见的身材比例为基础的，这是一个错误。他勇敢地决定放弃目前所做的一切，重新开始。他利用他从失败中学到的东西，做出了一个不同的设计。最后，他成功了，顾客很高兴。但是，要做到这一点，约书亚必须认识到自己的处境需要彻底转变思路，而不是小修小补。他必须放弃当时所做的一切，包括材料、制作裁缝的工作、他和顾客的时间，而这需要勇气。不过他的首要任务是把工作尽可能做好，而他只有重新开始才能达到这个目标。于是约书亚跳出了他工作中的窠臼 —— 他学到的方法与习惯的假设，采用了另一种思路。这很难做到，但这也是进步的重要组成部分。

这种改变思路的能力是成为专家的标志。

做了几年全科医生后，我也有了类似的经历。有一位名叫贝萨妮的患者前来找我，因为她感觉很累。她当时 40 多岁，需要照顾家庭，为事业奔忙。除了消化不良，她的病史里没有什么具体问题。我安排了一次验血，结果表明她有贫血，所以下一步就是找出原因。我有点儿担心她可能会有更严重的问题。我认识贝萨妮很多年了，她看起来有些不对劲。由于她消化不良，我把她转诊给了肠胃科医生。肠胃科医生安排了各项检查，包括内窥镜检查（把一根软管伸入胃中，另一根伸入直肠），结果都是正常的。他向贝萨妮保证一切正常。但几个月后，贝萨妮又来见我，因为她越来越累了。

虽然医院的肠胃科顾问医师说她没有问题，但我意识到，这只是因为他是从专科医生的角度来看待问题的。他说贝萨妮没有问题，他的意思其实是她的消化系统没有问题 —— 并不是说她完全没有问题。作为全科医生，我的工作是后退一步，思考我们是否提出了正确的问题。也许她的问题不在于消化系统，而完全在于身体的其他部分。

最后，事实证明贝萨妮患有早期子宫癌。幸运的是，我们发现得很及时，她也恢复了健康，但我当时很可能会忽视这个问题。我们非常容易从问题的初始思路出发，并一直坚持那套假设。我必须学会停下来、后退、重新思考 —— 检查我是否在治疗正确的问题。

我相信我们都曾坚持过错误的假设，治疗患者的症状而非找出导致症状的原因。房子里的灯熄灭时，你的第一反应是换灯泡。但是如果你换的灯泡也坏了，那你就得寻找其他的解释了。我在学生时代开的那辆破旧的莫里斯小型面包车也出现过这样的问题。有一天，这辆车嘎吱一声，在路边抛锚了。燃油表上显示「满」，所以我知道那不是问题的原因。我给道路救援机构打了电话，维修师傅做的第一件事就是用一个罐子往油箱里倒了一些汽油。汽车立即发动了，我觉得自己像个十足的傻瓜。原来是我的燃油表有问题，卡在了「满」的位置上。

### 6.5 思路的错误

Mistaking the frame

If you make a textbook landing at the wrong airport or perfectly execute an unsuitable hairstyle, your error is not a failure of technique. It's a failure to perceive the bigger picture. Becoming expert means you have to combine knowledge and skill with an understanding of the whole context. You have to be vigilant for what is happening around the edges of your situation, not just at the centre.

By this stage, you're on the verge of becoming a Journeyman, of working independently. Error has different consequences and implications from when you were an Apprentice. Errors now may affect the work itself, your colleagues, or others such as patients or passengers. And for every full-blown error there will be lots of near misses. Some of these will be blameworthy, others not. But part of becoming expert is developing resilience, carrying on without either trivializing errors or allowing them to destroy you. As Samuel Beckett tersely put it: ‘Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.'

This requires self-awareness and insight. Back in the world of medicine, Renée Fox – in her 1957 book Training for Uncertainty – identifies three types of uncertainty. ‘The first results from incomplete or imperfect mastery of available knowledge,' she writes. ‘The second depends upon limitations in current medical knowledge … The third source of uncertainty derives from the first two. This consists of difficulty in distinguishing between personal ignorance or ineptitude and the limitations of present medical knowledge.' While Fox was focused on medicine, this holds true in all fields of expertise: it's hard to know what you don't know.

Often it's not because people don't know enough that they make errors, but because for some reason they do the wrong thing. No matter how many times someone tells you to save your project on the computer, sooner or later you don't bother and a day's work is lost. However often your boss warns you not to over-tighten a nut on an engine you're working on, one day you go too far and shear it off. This kind of error is how you develop an embodied understanding of the material world and what it feels like to interact with it. This is how you learn to recognize limits, to know when materials or people are on the verge of collapse. It's only by shearing off a nut that you stock your internal library with ‘tight' and ‘over-tight'. It's a horrible feeling, but it happens to us all.

It happened to me when I was building my harpsichord. By that time, it was over ten years since my debacle at Johannesburg Airport and I was back in the UK. After six months, the end was in sight. I'd finished the basic assembly, put the keyboard into position and shaped the hundreds of jacks for the strings. I was on to the ‘voicing', scraping and shaping the plectra to give the instrument its touch and tone.

The art of voicing is to shave each plectrum with a scalpel so that its volume and tone matches the other notes. Once you've learned to use the scalpel without slicing your thumb off, you work on each plectrum in turn. This is a challenge. Take off too little and the sound is harsh and aggressive. Take off too much and it becomes barely audible. A fraction further and the plectrum snaps. The process gets more difficult as you go on, because the heavier bass strings need firmer plectra than the lightweight treble ones. Voicing harpsichord plectra is working with thin materials on the verge of collapse. Like Duncan Hooson and his pottery vases, the line between too little and too much is very fine.

Finally, after months of work, my harpsichord was finished. Every note worked, the voicing sounded reasonable and I couldn't wait to play it. But first I had to get it out of the tiny bedroom where I'd built it, allowing my youngest daughter to return. When it was in a larger room, I discovered to my horror that I could hardly hear it. The sound was completely lost: I had shaved all the plectra too far. In what I later learned was a classic beginner's blunder, I had voiced it for the room where I was making it, not the room where it would be played. In the words of Fabrice and the hairstylists, when it's too short, it's too late. You can't put it back if you remove too much. All you can do is start again. I had to remove every one of those two hundred plectra and go through the whole painful process again. I was furious with myself.

Here were several problems. I'd never built a harpsichord before, so I had no idea of the stages which lay ahead of me or what it should sound like. I was building the instrument in isolation, away from anybody who could help, so I wasn't part of a community of practice. I was trying to interpret instructions written by somebody who was already expert and knew what the final outcome should be. Such instructions assume prior knowledge, which in my case I did not have. And because I'd never played a harpsichord, I didn't really know what mine should sound like or how it should feel. I had few coordinates when plotting my path through making that instrument, and no clear idea of where I was heading.

如果你在错误的机场完成了一次教科书般的降落，或者完美地剪出了一个不合适的发型，那么你的错误并不是技术上的失败，而是未能看清大局的失败。成为专家意味着你必须将知识和技能与对整体情境的理解结合起来。你必须对周边发生的事情保持清醒的认识，而不是仅仅关注问题的核心。

在这个阶段，你即将成为独立工作的熟练工。在做学徒的时候，你犯错的后果和影响与此时不同。现在的错误可能会影响工作本身、你的同事或他人，比如患者或乘客。你每犯一个严重的错误之前，都会经历许多次「未遂事故」。一些「未遂事故」是应受责备的，还有些则不是。但是，成为专家还需要你培养抗逆力，坚持前行，同时不要轻视错误，也不要让错误打垮你。萨缪尔·贝克特（Samuel Beckett）简洁明了地指出：「尝试过，失败过，都无妨。再尝试，再失败，纵使失败也是进步。」

这需要自我意识与洞察力。回到医学界，勒妮·福克斯 （Renée Fox）在她 1957 年出版的《不确定性训练》（Training forUncertainty）中提出了三种不确定性。「第一种不确定性源于对发现有知识的掌握不完全、不完美，」她写道，「第二种不确定性取决于当前医学知识的局限性…… 不确定性的第三种来源，是前两种不确定性的结果。这种不确定性包含了如何分辨个人的无知、无能与现有医学知识局限性的难题。」虽然福克斯讨论的重点是医学，但这个道理适用于所有专业领域：你很难知道自己不知道什么。

通常情况下，大家犯错并不是因为他们知道得不够多，而是因为他们出于某种原因做了错误的事情。不管别人多少次告诉你要在电脑上保存自己的工作项目，但迟早你会把这种忠告抛诸脑后，一天的劳动就此付诸东流。不管你的老板多少次警告你不要把引擎上的螺母拧得太紧，但总有一天你会用力过度，把螺母拧坏。你需要靠这种错误来发展对于物质世界的具身理解，并了解与之互动的感觉。你需要靠这种方式了解工作中的极限，知道何时工作对象或他人会濒临崩溃。只有通过拧坏螺母，你才能在内部感觉库中存储「紧」和「太紧」的感觉。这是一种可怕的感受，但我们人人都会体会到。

我在制作羽管键琴时就遇到过这样的事情。那时候，距我在约翰内斯堡机场犯错已有十多年之久了，我已经回到了英国。开始制作的六个月后，我似乎又面临了世界末日。我已经完成了基本的组装，装好了琴键，做好了几百个安装琴弦的顶杆。现在我要开始「定音」了，刮制弦拨，为羽管键琴赋予触感与音色。定音的诀窍在于用小刀削刮每根弦拨，使其音量与音色与其他琴键相匹配。一旦你学会了使用小刀而不把拇指切掉，你就能依次加工每个弦拨了。这是一项挑战。刮得太少，琴音就会尖锐刺耳。刮得太多，琴音就几乎听不到了。再多刮一点，弦拨就会断成两截。这个过程会变得越来越困难，因为比起较轻的高音弦，较重的低音弦需要的弦拨更结实。为羽管键琴的弦拨定音，就是在崩溃的边缘处理脆弱的工作对象。就像邓肯·胡森制作陶瓷花瓶一样，「太少」和「太多」之间的界限非经过几个月的努力，我的羽管键琴终于要完成了。每个琴常微妙。

键都能正常工作，听起来定音做得不错，我已经迫不及待地想要弹奏了。但首先我得把琴从制作它的小卧室里搬出来，把卧室还给小女儿。移到大一些的房间里时，我惊恐地发现，我几乎听不到羽管键琴的声音。声音似乎完全消失了：我把所有弦拨刮得太多了。后来我了解到，这是一个典型的初学者错误，我是为制作羽管键琴的房间给琴定的音，却没有为演奏它的房间定音。借用法布里斯和其他发型设计师的话来说，「刮得太短，为时已晚」。如果你刮掉的部分太多，就不能再拼回去了。

你只能重新开始。我必须将那 200 个弦拨一个一个地取下来，再经历一次这个痛苦的过程。我很生自己的气。

这里有几个问题。我以前从没制作过羽管键琴，所以我不知道我要经历哪些阶段，也不知道它应该发出什么样的声音。我是在孤立的环境里制作这台乐器的，没有任何可以帮助我的人，所以我不是实践社群中的一员。我在试着解读一个已经是专家的人写的说明书，他知道最终结果应该是什么样的。这样的说明书假定我有先前的相关知识，但我没有。因为我从没弹过羽管键琴，所以我并不真正知道我的琴应该发出什么声音，也不知道它弹起来应该有什么感觉。我在制作这台乐器时，并没有多少参照点，也不清楚我的目标。

### 6.6 集体错误与同谋

Collective error and collusion

My error in voicing the harpsichord was mine alone, caused by my inexperience and an inability to understand the bigger picture. But unlike mistakes in an individual's workshop, errors in surgery are seldom caused by one person alone. Sometimes they happen by default, by inaction or by a collective reluctance to intervene. Sometimes they are difficult to explain afterwards.

I experienced this at first hand during one of my hospital attachments – a cardiac surgery unit where the atmosphere was toxic. For some reason, the consultants seemed to be at war with one another. As a registrar (a surgeon in training), I felt the brunt of this hostility. After heart surgery, patients go to the intensive care unit (ICU) to recover. At any time, the ICU would contain patients for each of the consultants I worked for. One of my jobs was to make sure these patients were stable, and to adjust the intravenous drugs that supported their hearts after the operation. Every four hours there would be an ICU ward round. The consultant surgeons would take it in turns to lead the round and give instructions. Each countermanded the orders of the one before, for no good reason that I could see except to impose their authority. It was a horrible place to work.

Part of my job involved assisting at open heart operations, where patients with aortic or mitral valve disease would be put onto a cardiopulmonary bypass (heart–lung machine), so that their heart could be stopped, the faulty valve cut out and an artificial one put in. Although the operation was routine and generally safe, it was important to minimize how long the patient remained on bypass, as it could lead to brain damage and other complications.

Replacement valves at that time consisted of a silastic ball within a metal cage. As the heart contracts, the ball moves forward into the cage and allows the blood to flow. As the heart relaxes, the ball falls back and blocks the flow. The cage was surrounded by a fabric ring, which allowed the new valve to be securely sewn in with a watertight join.

One day, I was the second assistant in a valve replacement performed by a senior consultant. The first assistant was an experienced registrar who was specializing in cardiac surgery, and the rest of the team (scrub nurse, runners, pump technician and many others) had done this procedure countless times. I'd only ever seen a couple of valve replacements.

Once the patient was on bypass and the heart had been stopped, the consultant swiftly excised the diseased valve. Then he began the painstaking process of sewing in the new one. As usual, he started by inserting a circle of long sutures, each taking a firm bite through the residual rim of the diseased valve before passing through the fabric ring of the replacement. He would slide the new valve down these threads until it was snugly seated in the heart, then tie the sutures.

While this was happening, I got an uncomfortable feeling. I tried to visualize what this new valve would look like once it was in the heart, thinking which way the silastic ball would move in its cage. It didn't seem right and I couldn't imagine how the blood would flow through it in the proper direction. I almost wondered if I should say something, but it seemed unimaginable that this highly experienced surgeon could put in a valve the wrong way round. Anyway, surely the other (also highly experienced) members of the team would shout if there was a problem. So I said nothing. I carried on holding my retractor while the surgeon slid the valve into position and tied all the sutures. His first assistant cut each of the excess threads, leaving a tiny knot.

Suddenly the surgeon realized what had happened. All the usual theatre noises stopped and there was a profound silence. First, very quietly, he said, ‘Fuck.' Then: ‘Sister, I'll need to remove the valve and put it in again.' Everyone knew how serious this was, as the additional time would take the patient into the danger zone for being on bypass. Nobody said a word as he cut all the stitches, removed the valve and went through the whole process a second time. Afterwards, I never heard anybody allude to it. It was as if it had never happened. Luckily, the patient was fine, but it was a mistake which could have had devastating consequences.

Thinking back over that experience, I can understand it from the surgeon's perspective. One cause of error is the narrowing of attention that comes with stressful, high-stakes work. Experts depend on the ability to focus on what they are doing and push away distractions. By zooming in on the work at hand, they give it their undivided attention. But this risks over-focusing on one part of the picture, blunting their awareness of what's happening all around. It is easy to imagine becoming so absorbed in a task like putting in a heart valve that wider questions about whether it's the right way round might become lost. You could become preoccupied by the challenges of sewing brittle tissue, adjusting suture tension to ensure a leak-proof fit, and completing the task with swift efficiency. As I learned the hard way in Johannesburg in my little Cessna, and again when voicing my harpsichord back in the UK, it's all too easy to lose sight of the big picture when you're struggling with the details.

The bigger question is about that surgical team. To this day I cannot understand why nobody said anything. Many people must have known – the first assistant certainly, the scrub nurse too, and most likely others in the room. Probably, it was a combination of an unwillingness to challenge authority, a fear of ridicule by talking out of turn, and a potentially lethal dash of Schadenfreude within a workplace that was based on competition between ambitious professionals rather than collaboration for the benefit of patients. Even I'd had an inkling but was too afraid to speak up. At that stage I was a peripheral participant in a community of practice whose ways I hadn't become familiar with, and I allowed myself to collude in a shared silence.

Patient safety is a major issue worldwide. Medicine and surgery have learned a lot from aviation, especially in terms of authority within the cockpit. This problem of collusive silence is well known in hierarchical systems. Responding to a series of catastrophic accidents over many years, often caused by communication failure, aviation has empowered everyone to have a voice and to feel comfortable in stating the obvious. Current airline practice expects every member of the team to speak out if they notice anything amiss – and they do. I often thought about my experience with the heart valve in the years that followed, as evidence mounted that medical errors are seldom the fault of one person. I kept wondering why I hadn't spoken up.

The enormous body of literature on error shows that few disasters are caused by individual incompetence, inattention or sheer bad luck. But case after case also demonstrates how individuals are blamed for wider issues within organizations and systems. This continues to happen with medical errors, and high-profile examples such as the paediatrician Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba, under whose care a child died, have exposed fault lines in the way that medical and other professions deal with harm. Experts such as James Reason, Don Berwick, Charles Vincent and Atul Gawande have explored the assumptions we make, the actions we take and the difficulties we have in acknowledging and learning from error. Their insights fit with research from safety-critical industries such as aviation, offshore oil drilling and nuclear power.

James Reason is well known for his ‘Swiss cheese' model of error. He has pointed out that weaknesses in a system are like holes in a slice of Emmental. If several slices line up, they allow an error to pass through and cause disaster. That's what happened when I landed unannounced in KSL at Johannesburg airport: I flew along the lined-up holes in the Swiss cheese. I was inexperienced, the control tower team were inattentive, the system's level of alertness was low. By good fortune, there wasn't an airliner coming through those same holes in the cheese towards me. But it was a close shave. I hope that the control tower team learned as much as I did.

浅花我在给羽管键琴定音时的错误是我自己一个人的责任，因为我缺乏经验，无法从全局来考虑问题。但是，与个人工坊里的错误不同，手术中的错误很少是由一个人造成的。有时这些错误是由于默认、不作为的态度或大家不愿意干预而造成的。这些错误有时在事后很难解释。

我在医院实习时对这一点有过亲身的体会。当时我所在的心外科的氛围很糟糕。由于某种原因，顾问医师似乎在相互争斗。作为一名住院医生（正在受训的外科医生），我能感受到这种敌意的冲击。在心脏手术后，患者会被送入重症监护室休养。不论何时，我的每位顾问医师都有患者在重症监护室里。我的任务之一，就是确保这些患者病情稳定，并调整在术后支持他们心脏的静脉药物。每隔四小时就会有一次查房。外科顾问医师会轮流带领我们查房，做出指示。每位顾问医师都会撤销上一位医师发出的指令，除了强调自己的权威，我看不出他们这样做有什么理由。那是个可怕的工作环境。

我的部分工作任务是协助心内直视手术。在手术中，医生会给患有主动脉瓣或二尖瓣疾病的患者接上体外循环机（人工心肺机），这样患者的心脏就可以停止跳动，医生就可以切除有缺陷的瓣膜，植入人工瓣膜。虽然这种手术很常规，而且一般来说是安全的，但重要的是要尽量减少患者停留在体外循环机上的时间，因为这可能会导致脑损伤和其他并发症。

当时的替换瓣膜是一个装在金属笼架内的硅橡胶球。当心脏收缩时，硅橡胶球会向前移动，让血液流通。心脏舒张时，球会回到原来的位置，阻断血流。笼架周围有一个缝环，缝环使得新瓣膜能够牢固地缝合，缝合处不会渗出液体。

有一天，我担任由一位资深顾问医师主刀的瓣膜置换手术的第二助手。第一助手是一位经验丰富的心外科住院医生，团队的其他成员（洗手护士、巡回护士、血泵技术员以及许多其他人）都做过无数次这样的手术了。我只观摩过几次瓣膜置换患者一接上体外循环机，心脏一停止跳动，顾问医师就迅手术。

速切除了病变的瓣膜。然后，他就开始了缝合新瓣膜的艰苦过程。与往常一样，他开始了缝合。要缝上长长的一圈，每一针都要结结实实地穿过病变瓣膜残留的边缘，然后再穿过替换瓣膜的缝环。他让新瓣膜顺着这些缝合线滑落下去，直到瓣膜牢牢地固定在心脏上，然后打结。

在这个过程中，我产生了一种不舒服的感觉。我试着想象这个新瓣膜在心脏里是什么样子，硅橡胶球会在笼架里如何移动。似乎有些不对劲，我无法想象血液如何沿着正确的方向流过瓣膜。我有些犹豫自己是否应该说些什么，但似乎更难想象的是，这个经验丰富的外科医生会把瓣膜的方向装反。不管怎样，如果真的出了错，团队里的其他成员（经验也都非常丰富）肯定会喊出声来的。于是我什么都没说。我继续握着牵开器，外科医生将瓣膜放到合适的位置，然后给所有的缝合线打结。

他的第一助手把多余的线头剪掉，留下小结。突然主刀的外科医生意识到发生了什么。手术室里平常的噪声突然都不见了，只有一片寂静。他先是小声地骂了一句，

然后他说：「护士，我得把瓣膜取出来再放进去。」每个人都知道这有多严重，因为患者在体外循环机上，更长的时间会带来危险。他剪开所有缝合线，取出瓣膜，又做了一遍整个过程。没有人说一句话。此后，我没有听任何人提起过这件事。就好像这件事从没有发生过一样。幸运的是，患者没事，但这是一个可能会导致灾难性后果的错误。

站在外科医生的角度，回想起那段经历，我可以表示理解。犯错的一个原因是压力大、风险高的工作会使人的注意力范围变得狭窄。专家很依赖专注于手头工作、排除干扰的能力。通过专注于手头的工作，他们全身心地投入其中。但是，这可能会让他们过度关注事情的某一部分，使他们意识不到事情的所有其他方面。我们很容易想象，如果你全神贯注于一项任务，比如放置心脏瓣膜，那你就可能忽视更宏观的问题，比如放置的方向是否正确。你可能会全神贯注于缝合脆弱的组织、调整缝合的松紧以保证密封性、快速高效地完成任务等多项挑战。在约翰内斯堡的塞斯纳小飞机上，以及在英国给羽管键琴定音时，我学到了这一惨痛的教训：如果你纠结于细节，就很容易忽视大局。

问题更大的是那个手术团队。至今我仍然不明白，为什么没有人指出错误。很多人肯定知道 —— 第一助手肯定知道，洗手护士也知道，房间里的其他人很可能都知道。或许，这是因为大家不愿挑战权威、害怕因为说错话而遭人嘲笑，以及一种可能置人于死地的幸灾乐祸 —— 在这种工作场所里，雄心勃勃的专业人士只顾互相竞争，而不肯为了患者的利益相互合作。就连我也隐约察觉出了问题，但不敢说出来。在当时，我是实践社群的边缘人，我不熟悉他们的做事方式，我任由自己成为患者安全是一个世界范围内的大问题。内科和外科已经从这种共同沉默的同谋。

航空领域学到了许多东西，尤其是在驾驶舱内的权威方面。这种共谋的沉默在等级森严的系统中是众所周知的。多年来，由于经历了一系列灾难性事故（往往是由沟通不畅造成的），航空公司让每个人都拥有了发言权，能够自由地指出显而易见的问题。航空公司目前的做法是，一旦发现问题，团队中的每一个成员都要直言不讳 —— 他们也的确做到了这一点。在后来的许多年里，我经常想起那次心脏瓣膜置换手术的经历，因为越来越多的证据表明，医疗事故很少是一个人的过错。我一直在想我为什么没有说出来。

大量关于「错误」的文献表明，严重的错误很少是由个人的无能、疏忽或坏运气造成的；但一个接一个的案例也表明，个体会因为组织和系统内更广泛的问题而遭受指责。在医疗事故中，这种情况仍在不断发生。像儿科医生哈迪扎·巴瓦－加尔巴（Hadiza Bawa-Garba）这样著名的案例（一名儿童在其护理下死亡）暴露了医疗和其他行业处理伤害事故方面的隐忧。

詹姆斯·里森（James Reason）、唐·贝里克（Don Berwick）、查尔斯·文森特（Charles Vincent）与阿图尔·加万德（Atul Gawande）等专家研究了人们做出的假设、采取的行动，以及在承认错误、从错误中学习时遇到的困难。他们的见解与航空、海上石油钻探、核能等高度注重行业安全的领域的研究一致。

詹姆斯·里森以他的「瑞士奶酪」错误模型而闻名。他指出，系统中的弱点就像多孔奶酪片上的孔一样。如果几片奶酪连在一起，它们的孔就会允许错误畅通无阻，造成灾难。这就是我驾驶 KSL 在约翰内斯堡机场意外降落时发生的事情：我沿着瑞士奶酪上的一排孔飞了过去。我缺乏经验，而控制塔团队也不专心，机场管制系统的警惕性也很低。幸运的是，没有别的飞机沿着奶酪上相同的孔朝我飞来。这只是侥幸。我希望控制塔团队能像我一样学到很多东西。

### 6.7 专家与错误

Experts and error

So what is the relationship between error and learning? Error can have a devastating effect on you and your work, even if nobody gets killed or injured. When you make a mistake, it's easy to believe that you have failed as a person and allow it to shatter your self-belief. Somehow you have to distinguish between the consequences of error for your work and its impact upon you. How you navigate this determines whether you frame error as a constructive process, by which you mature and progress, or a destructive one which demolishes your confidence. Musicians and managing directors alike will talk about preparation, performance and recovery as resilience: the ability to survive when things go wrong and to make something positive of the experience. Yet despite its power to teach us, error in many settings remains a dirty word.

Sometimes mistakes happen through ignorance, inattention or hubris. If that's the case, you need to acknowledge those unappealing aspects of yourself and head off repetitions. (I certainly never landed a plane at the wrong airport again.) At other times, error is just a painful part of becoming expert. Of course, the consequences of error depend on your field of expertise. There is an old truism that nobody dies if you play a wrong note on the concert platform, whereas if you're performing a surgical operation or flying an aeroplane, error can literally be fatal. That's true when you focus on those who experience the error – the audience, patients or passengers. But the effect of error can be devastating for those making it too. If playing a wrong note early in a pianist's career leads to debilitating stage fright, they can get stuck in their path to becoming expert. It is only if you can learn from error and build up resilience that you can progress to the later stages.

Back in the Bara operating theatre with Jonas, I wait for my heart to stop pounding. I have to put aside the nightmare of what could have happened if I'd snipped that grey squidgy structure that turned out to be his internal jugular vein. I'd been working with too much speed and I'd made assumptions. Fighting down a sense of panic, I force myself to be systematic, to take things slowly and examine every structure I encounter. Gradually, the knowledge from textbooks and the dissecting room reasserts itself and I start to make sense of the landscape of Jonas's injured neck, and all those little buggers I'd spent so long memorizing. I recognize some familiar structures and get back on track. I realize that the operation may be difficult but it's not beyond the boundaries of my skill. I may be butting up against my limits, but as long as I'm strict with myself and maintain focus, I can do it.

Eventually I find where the blood is coming from. I control the bleeding with vascular clamps and close the hole with tiny stitches. I take the clamps off and breathe a sigh of relief when the operative field stays dry. Finally, I'm able to close the wound and send Jonas to the recovery bay. Every time I see Jonas on the ward after that, I think what a narrow escape we both had. I'm relieved he's getting better but I have a queasy feeling that my inexperience put me a hair's breadth from making a bad situation infinitely worse. But that comes with the territory of flying solo.

So, error is something that happens to us all. But there is a distinction between the errors we make through inexperience, the ones we make through sloppiness or inattention, and those ‘honourable errors' that come from trying things out and finding they don't work. If you are going to improve, you have to venture out from the safety of the workshop or studio into the real world, and that involves getting things wrong. Now the errors you make have consequences, both for you and for other people. Part of becoming expert is developing resilience, finding ways of coping that neither minimize the impact of your actions nor damage your confidence beyond repair.

You are now poised at the threshold between the sheltered world of the Apprentice and the harsher milieu of the independent practitioner, the Journeyman. We've already seen some of the bad things that can happen, the near misses and narrow squeaks. The next chapters explore the internal shifts that have to take place as you push yourself out there and develop the individuality that defines the expert you are going to become. At the time it seems like magic. And, in a sense, it is.

那么，错误与学习之间有什么关系？即使没有人员伤亡，错误也可能对你和你的工作产生毁灭性的影响。在犯错时，你很容易相信自己是个失败的人，允许错误击碎你的自我信念。你必须设法区分错误对工作造成的后果，以及它对你产生的影响。如何处理这一问题，将决定你是把错误看作使你成熟和进步的建设性过程，还是摧毁你信心的破坏性过程。无论是音乐家还是总经理，他们都会谈论准备、表现与恢复（抗逆力）：在出错后坚持下来，并从这种经历中取得积极结果的能力。然而，尽管错误能给我们经验教训，但在许多情况下，它依然是一个令人讨厌的词。

有时错误的发生是因为无知、疏忽或傲慢。如果是这样的话，你需要承认自己那些不够好的方面，以免重蹈覆辙（我再也没有把飞机降落在错误的机场了）。还有些时候，错误只是成为专家的痛苦部分。当然，错误的后果取决于你的专业领域。有一句老话说得很好，如果你在音乐会的舞台上弹错了音，没有人会死，但如果你在做手术或开飞机时犯了错，就可能要人命。

想想那些受错误影响的人，如观众、患者或乘客，这句话说得没错。但是对于那些犯错的人来说，错误的影响可能同样是毁灭性的。如果钢琴家在职业生涯早期弹错音符而导致怯场，这种错误就可能阻碍他们成为专家。只有从错误中吸取经验教训，培养抗逆力，你才能进入更高级的阶段。

回到在巴拉瓜纳医院给乔纳斯做手术的时候。我在等待心跳恢复平静。如果我剪断了那条滑腻的灰色组织 —— 他的颈内静脉，那会发生什么？我必须把这个可怕的想法放在一边。我的动作太快了，我做了一些假设。我强压内心的恐慌，迫使自己放慢速度，有条不紊地检查我看到的每一个组织。渐渐地，从教科书与解剖室里得来的知识显得越来越有道理了，我开始看清乔纳斯受伤的脖子里的组织结构了，也看到了所有那些我花了很长时间才记下来的小东西。我认出了一些熟悉的组织，回到了正轨上。我知道手术可能很难，但没有超出我的能力范围。我可能要使出浑身解数，但只要我严格要求自己，保持专注，我就能做到。

最后我找到了出血的位置。我用血管钳控制住出血，用细线缝合伤口。当手术区不再被血液浸湿的时候，我取下血管钳，松了一口气。终于，我缝合了伤口，把乔纳斯送去康复病房。

从那以后，每次我在病房里看见乔纳斯，都会想起我们俩死里逃生的经历。他的病情正在好转，我松了一口气，但我有一种不舒服的感觉；因为我缺乏经验，差一点就让糟糕的情况变得不可挽回。但是，这就是独当一面必然会遇到的事情。

我们每个人都会犯错。但是，我们因缺乏经验、马虎或疏忽而犯的错误，与那些因为尝试而失败的「可敬错误」是有区别的。如果你想进步，就必须冒险离开工坊或工作室里的安全地带，进入现实世界，这就必然会导致犯错。你在这时犯的错误会对你和其他人产生影响。成为专家的一部分，就是培养抗逆力，你要想办法既不为自己行为的影响开脱，又不让自己的信心受到无法挽回的打击。

你现在处在学徒受保护的环境与独立工作者（熟练工）的严苛环境之间的门槛上。我们已经看到，有些糟糕的事情可能会发生，也可能会有未遂事故与险情。在接下来的章节里，我们将探索你必须做出的内在转变。你要鞭策自己走上世界的舞台，发展个性。这种个性定义了你将要成为的专家。在那时，这一切就像变魔术一样。从某种意义上讲，的确如此。
