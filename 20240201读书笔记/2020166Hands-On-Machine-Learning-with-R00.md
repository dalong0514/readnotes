### 0101. 主题卡——数据清洗之填补缺失数据

Most Machine Learning algorithms cannot work with missing features, so let’s create a few functions to take care of them. You noticed earlier that the `total_bedrooms` attribute has some missing values, so let’s fix this. You have three options:

• Get rid of the corresponding districts.

• Get rid of the whole attribute.

• Set the values to some value (zero, the mean, the median, etc.).

You can accomplish these easily using DataFrame’s `dropna()`, `drop()`, and `fillna()` methods:

```py
# option 1
housing.dropna(subset=["total_bedrooms"])
# option 2
housing.drop("total_bedrooms", axis=1)
# option 3
median = housing["total_bedrooms"].median() 
housing["total_bedrooms"].fillna(median, inplace=True)
```

If you choose option 3, you should compute the median value on the training set, and use it to fill the missing values in the training set, but also don’t forget to save the median value that you have computed. You will need it later to replace missing values in the test set when you want to evaluate your system, and also once the system goes live to replace missing values in new data.

Scikit-Learn provides a handy class to take care of missing values: SimpleImputer. Here is how to use it. First, you need to create a SimpleImputer instance, specifying that you want to replace each attribute’s missing values with the median of that attribute:

```py
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy="median")
```

Since the median can only be computed on numerical attributes, we need to create a copy of the data without the text attribute `ocean_proximity`:

```py
housing_num = housing.drop("ocean_proximity", axis=1)
```

Now you can fit the imputer instance to the training data using the `fit()` method:

```py
imputer.fit(housing_num)
```

The imputer has simply computed the median of each attribute and stored the result in its `statistics_` instance variable. Only the `total_bedrooms` attribute had missing values, but we cannot be sure that there won’t be any missing values in new data after the system goes live, so it is safer to apply the imputer to all the numerical attributes:

```py
>>> imputer.statistics_ 
array([ -118.51 , 34.26 , 29. , 2119.5 , 433. , 1164. , 408. , 3.5409])
>>> housing_num.median().values 
array([ -118.51 , 34.26 , 29. , 2119.5 , 433. , 1164. , 408. , 3.5409])
```

Now you can use this “trained” imputer to transform the training set by replacing missing values by the learned medians:

```py
X = imputer.transform(housing_num)
```

The result is a plain NumPy array containing the transformed features. If you want to put it back into a Pandas DataFrame, it’s simple:

```py
housing_tr = pd.DataFrame(X, columns=housing_num.columns)
```

### 0102. 主题卡——数据清洗之归一化标准化

One of the most important transformations you need to apply to your data is feature scaling. With few exceptions, Machine Learning algorithms don’t perform well when the input numerical attributes have very different scales. This is the case for the housing data: the total number of rooms ranges from about 6 to 39,320, while the median incomes only range from 0 to 15. Note that scaling the target values is generally not required.

There are two common ways to get all attributes to have the same scale: min-max scaling and standardization.

Min-max scaling (many people call this normalization) is quite simple: values are shifted and rescaled so that they end up ranging from 0 to 1. We do this by subtracting the min value and dividing by the max minus the min. Scikit-Learn provides a transformer called MinMaxScaler for this. It has a `feature_range` hyperparameter that lets you change the range if you don’t want 0–1 for some reason.

Standardization is quite different: first it subtracts the mean value (so standardized values always have a zero mean), and then it divides by the standard deviation so that the resulting distribution has unit variance. Unlike min-max scaling, standardization does not bound values to a specific range, which may be a problem for some algorithms (e.g., neural networks often expect an input value ranging from 0 to 1). However, standardization is much less affected by outliers. For example, suppose a district had a median income equal to 100 (by mistake). Min-max scaling would then crush all the other values from 0–15 down to 0–0.15, whereas standardization would not be much affected. Scikit-Learn provides a transformer called StandardScaler for standardization.

As with all the transformations, it is important to fit the scalers to the training data only, not to the full dataset (including the test set). Only then can you use them to transform the training set and the test set (and new data).

### 0201. 术语卡——Machine Learning

Machine Learning is the science (and art) of programming computers so they can learn from data. Here is a slightly more general definition:

[Machine Learning is the] field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

—Arthur Samuel, 1959

And a more engineering-oriented one:

A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

—Tom Mitchell, 1997

For example, your spam filter is a Machine Learning program that can learn to flag spam given examples of spam emails (e.g., flagged by users) and examples of regular (nonspam, also called “ham”) emails. The examples that the system uses to learn are called the training set. Each training example is called a training instance (or sample). In this case, the task T is to flag spam for new emails, the experience E is the training data, and the performance measure P needs to be defined; for example, you can use the ratio of correctly classified emails. This particular performance measure is called accuracy and it is often used in classification tasks. If you just download a copy of Wikipedia, your computer has a lot more data, but it is not suddenly better at any task. Thus, it is not Machine Learning.

### 0202. 术语卡—— No Free Lunch Theorem

A model is a simplified version of the observations. The simplifications are meant to discard the superfluous details that are unlikely to generalize to new instances. However, to decide what data to discard and what data to keep, you must make assumptions. For example, a linear model makes the assumption that the data is fundamentally linear and that the distance between the instances and the straight line is just noise, which can safely be ignored.

In a famous 1996 paper, [11] David Wolpert demonstrated that if you make absolutely no assumption about the data, then there is no reason to prefer one model over any other. This is called the No Free Lunch (NFL) theorem. For some datasets the best model is a linear model, while for other datasets it is a neural network. There is no model that is a priori guaranteed to work better (hence the name of the theorem). The only way to know for sure which model is best is to evaluate them all. Since this is not possible, in practice you make some reasonable assumptions about the data and you evaluate only a few reasonable models. For example, for simple tasks you may evaluate linear models with various levels of regularization, and for a complex problem you may evaluate various neural networks.

### 01. The Machine Learning Tsunami

In 2006, Geoffrey Hinton et al. published a paper [1] showing how to train a deep neural network capable of recognizing handwritten digits with state-of-the-art precision (>98%). They branded this technique “Deep Learning.” Training a deep neural net was widely considered impossible at the time, [2] and most researchers had abandoned the idea since the 1990s. This paper revived the interest of the scientific community and before long many new papers demonstrated that Deep Learning was not only possible, but capable of mind-blowing achievements that no other Machine Learning (ML) technique could hope to match (with the help of tremendous computing power and great amounts of data). This enthusiasm soon extended to many other areas of Machine Learning.

Fast-forward 10 years and Machine Learning has conquered the industry: it is now at the heart of much of the magic in today’s high-tech products, ranking your web search results, powering your smartphone’s speech recognition, recommending videos, and beating the world champion at the game of Go. Before you know it, it will be driving your car.

### 02. Machine Learning in Your Projects

So naturally you are excited about Machine Learning and you would love to join the party! Perhaps you would like to give your homemade robot a brain of its own? Make it recognize faces? Or learn to walk around?

Or maybe your company has tons of data (user logs, financial data, production data, machine sensor data, hotline stats, HR reports, etc.), and more than likely you could unearth some hidden gems if you just knew where to look; for example: 1) Segment customers and find the best marketing strategy for each group. 2) Recommend products for each client based on what similar clients bought. 3) Detect which transactions are likely to be fraudulent. 4) Forecast next year’s revenue. 5) And more.

Whatever the reason, you have decided to learn Machine Learning and implement it in your projects. Great idea!

### 03. Objective and Approach

This book assumes that you know close to nothing about Machine Learning. Its goal is to give you the concepts, the intuitions, and the tools you need to actually implement programs capable of learning from data. We will cover a large number of techniques, from the simplest and most commonly used (such as linear regression) to some of the Deep Learning techniques that regularly win competitions.

Rather than implementing our own toy versions of each algorithm, we will be using actual production-ready Python frameworks:

1 Scikit-Learn is very easy to use, yet it implements many Machine Learning algorithms efficiently, so it makes for a great entry point to learn Machine Learning.

2 TensorFlow is a more complex library for distributed numerical computation. It makes it possible to train and run very large neural networks efficiently by distributing the computations across potentially hundreds of multi-GPU servers. TensorFlow was created at Google and supports many of their large-scale Machine Learning applications. It was open sourced in November 2015.

3 Keras is a high level Deep Learning API that makes it very simple to train and run neural networks. It can run on top of either TensorFlow, Theano or Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (formerly known as CNTK). TensorFlow comes with its own implementation of this API, called tf.keras, which provides support for some advanced TensorFlow features (e.g., to efficiently load data).

The book favors a hands-on approach, growing an intuitive understanding of Machine Learning through concrete working examples and just a little bit of theory. While you can read this book without picking up your laptop, we highly recommend you experiment with the code examples available online as Jupyter notebooks at [ageron/handson-ml2: A series of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2).

1-2『上面的 git 仓库里有详细的使用说明，目前已经下载仓库放在根目录下的「MachienLearning」文件夹。（2020-11-11）』

### 04. Prerequisites

This book assumes that you have some Python programming experience and that you are familiar with Python’s main scientific libraries, in particular NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. Also, if you care about what’s under the hood you should have a reasonable understanding of college-level math as well (calculus, linear algebra, probabilities, and statistics).

If you don’t know Python yet, http://learnpython.org/ is a great place to start. The official tutorial on python.org is also quite good. If you have never used Jupyter, Chapter 2 will guide you through installation and the basics: it is a great tool to have in your toolbox. If you are not familiar with Python’s scientific libraries, the provided Jupyter notebooks include a few tutorials. There is also a quick math tutorial for linear algebra.

1『哈哈，目前这些先决条件自己基本都满足。（2020-11-11）』

### 05. Roadmap

This book is organized in two parts. Part I, The Fundamentals of Machine Learning, covers the following topics:

1 What is Machine Learning? What problems does it try to solve? What are the main categories and fundamental concepts of Machine Learning systems?

2 The main steps in a typical Machine Learning project.

3 Learning by fitting a model to data.

4 Optimizing a cost function.

5 Handling, cleaning, and preparing data.

6 Selecting and engineering features.

7 Selecting a model and tuning hyperparameters using cross-validation.

8 The main challenges of Machine Learning, in particular underfitting and overfitting (the bias/variance tradeoff).

9 Reducing the dimensionality of the training data to fight the curse of dimensionality.

10 Other unsupervised learning techniques, including clustering, density estimation and anomaly detection.

11 The most common learning algorithms: Linear and Polynomial Regression, Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Ensemble methods.

Part II, Neural Networks and Deep Learning, covers the following topics:

1 What are neural nets? What are they good for?

2 Building and training neural nets using TensorFlow and Keras.

3 The most important neural net architectures: feedforward neural nets, convolutional nets, recurrent nets, long short-term memory (LSTM) nets, autoencoders and generative adversarial networks (GANs).

4 Techniques for training deep neural nets.

5 Scaling neural networks for large datasets.

6 Learning strategies with Reinforcement Learning.

7 Handling uncertainty with Bayesian Deep Learning.

The first part is based mostly on Scikit-Learn while the second part uses TensorFlow and Keras.

Don’t jump into deep waters too hastily: while Deep Learning is no doubt one of the most exciting areas in Machine Learning, you should master the fundamentals first. Moreover, most problems can be solved quite well using simpler techniques such as Random Forests and Ensemble methods (discussed in Part I). Deep Learning is best suited for complex problems such as image recognition, speech recognition, or natural language processing, provided you have enough data, computing power, and patience.

### 06. Other Resources

Many resources are available to learn about Machine Learning. Andrew Ng’s ML course on Coursera and Geoffrey Hinton’s course on neural networks and Deep Learning are amazing, although they both require a significant time investment (think months).

There are also many interesting websites about Machine Learning, including of course Scikit-Learn’s exceptional User Guide. You may also enjoy Dataquest, which provides very nice interactive tutorials, and ML blogs such as those listed on Quora. Finally, the Deep Learning website has a good list of resources to learn more.

Of course there are also many other introductory books about Machine Learning, in particular:

1 Joel Grus, Data Science from Scratch (O’Reilly). This book presents the fundamentals of Machine Learning, and implements some of the main algorithms in pure Python (from scratch, as the name suggests).

2 Stephen Marsland, Machine Learning: An Algorithmic Perspective (Chapman and Hall). This book is a great introduction to Machine Learning, covering a wide range of topics in depth, with code examples in Python (also from scratch, but using NumPy).

3 Sebastian Raschka, Python Machine Learning (Packt Publishing). Also a great introduction to Machine Learning, this book leverages Python open source libraries (Pylearn 2 and Theano).

3 François Chollet, Deep Learning with Python (Manning). A very practical book that covers a large range of topics in a clear and concise way, as you might expect from the author of the excellent Keras library. It favors code examples over mathematical theory.

4 Yaser S. Abu-Mostafa, Malik Magdon-Ismail, and Hsuan-Tien Lin, Learning from Data (AMLBook). A rather theoretical approach to ML, this book provides deep insights, in particular on the bias/variance tradeoff (see Chapter 4).

5 Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig, Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, 3rd Edition (Pearson). This is a great (and huge) book covering an incredible amount of topics, including Machine Learning. It helps put ML into perspective.

Finally, a great way to learn is to join ML competition websites such as Kaggle.com this will allow you to practice your skills on real-world problems, with help and insights from some of the best ML professionals out there.
