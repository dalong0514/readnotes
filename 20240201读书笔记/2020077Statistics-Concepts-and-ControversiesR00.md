### 0101. 主题卡 —— 随机无处不在（Variation is everywhere）

If a thermometer under your tongue reads higher than 98.6°F, do you have a fever? Maybe not. People vary in their「normal」temperature. Your own temperature also varies — it is lower around 6 A.M. and higher around 6 P.M. The government announces that the unemployment rate rose a tenth of a percent last month and that new home starts fell by 3%. The stock market promptly jumps (or sinks). Stocks are jumpier than is sensible. The government data come from samples that give good estimates but not the exact truth. Another run of the same samples would give slightly different answers. And economic facts jump around anyway, due to weather, strikes, holidays, and all sorts of other reasons.

Many people join the stock market in overreacting to minor changes in data that are really nothing but background noise. Here is Arthur Nielsen, head of the country’s largest market research firm, describing his experience:

Too many business people assign equal validity to all numbers printed on paper. They accept numbers as representing Truth and find it difficult to work with the concept of probability. They do not see a number as a kind of shorthand for a range that describes our actual knowledge of the underlying condition.

Variation is everywhere. Individuals vary; repeated measurements on the same individual vary; almost everything varies over time. Ignore the pundits who try to explain the deep reasons behind each day’s stock market moves, or who condemn a team’s ability and character after a game decided by a last-second shot that did or didn’t go in.

变异性无所不在

如果你的舌下温度超过 37 摄氏度，是不是就代表你在发烧呢？也许不是，每个人的「正常」体温都存在差异。你自己的体温在一天当中也会有变化，早上 6 点时稍高，下午 6 点时稍低。美国政府宣布上个月的失业率上升 0.1 个百分点，而新屋开工率下降 3 个百分点，导致股市波动。股市波动常常是不理性的。政府的数据是根据那些给出乐观预测的样本得出的，是好的估计，但不是百分之百的事实。同样的调查再做一遍，结果会有一些差别。和经济有关的因素原本就会上下波动，影响它的因素包括气候、罢工事件、节假日以及各式各样的其他原因。

很多人会像股市一样，对数据的一些微小变化做出过度反应，而事实上这些并不是实质性变化，根本微不足道。以下是全美最大的市场研究公司的领导人阿瑟·尼尔森的经验之谈：

太多商界人士对白纸黑字印出来的数字都深信不疑。他们认为数字就代表「事实」，让他们用「概率」的视角来看事情有点儿困难。他们不了解，数字只是一种简化的表示方法，它描述了一个范围，这个范围表明我们在现有情况下对某个问题的实际了解有多少。

1『尼尔森的话太精辟了。数字只是一种简化的表示方法，只能描述事实的一个范围，而这个范围只是表明了我们在现有的信息下，对某个问题实际了解的程度。随机性无处不在，做一张主题卡片。回复：此时此刻再看，还是很震撼，数字只是一种简化的表示方法。（2021-02-10）』——已完成

变异性无所不在。个体之间有差别，对同一个个体多测量几次，结果也会不一样，并且几乎每件事都会随着时间的变化而变化。至于一些所谓的专家对每天股市变化背后的深入原因分析，或者对一场其实是最后一秒才定输赢的球赛，却硬要归咎于输球球队的能力或战术，你尽可以对这些嗤之以鼻。

As far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality they are not certain, and as far as they are certain they do not refer to reality. —— ALBERT EINSTEIN

Because variation is everywhere, statistical conclusions are not certain. Most women who reach middle age have regular mammograms to detect breast cancer. Do mammograms really reduce the risk of dying of breast cancer? Statistical studies of high quality find that mammograms reduce the risk of death in women aged 50 to 64 years by 26%. That’s an average over all women in the age group. Because variation is everywhere, the results are different for different women. Some women who have mammograms every year die of breast cancer, and some who never have mammograms live to 100 and die when they crash their motorcycles.

What the summary study actually said was「mammography reduces the risk of dying of breast cancer by 26 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 17 to 34 percent).」That 26% is, in Arthur Nielsen’s words,「shorthand for a range that describes our actual knowledge of the underlying condition.」The range is 17% to 34%, and we are 95% confident that the truth lies in that range. We’re pretty sure, in other words, but not certain. Once you get beyond news reports, you can look for phrases like「95% confident」and「statistically significant」that tell us that a study did produce findings that, while not certain, are pretty sure.

数学定律不能百分之百地应用于现实生活，能百分之百地用数学定律来描述的就不是现实生活。—— 阿尔伯特·爱因斯坦

1『爱因斯坦这句话其实很有深意的，目前的理解：数学是完全抽象的逻辑世界，是柏拉图式的世界，可以说数据世界是绝对的，关键是数学定理可以在现实世界里对应于一个个应用，这本身就是奇怪，根本毫无理由的。所以这里爱因斯坦说数据定理不能百分百应用于生活，能大部分应用于生活，我们已经很庆幸了，数学它没有义务跟我们现实生活一一对应。（2020-11-21）』

因为变化无所不在，所以统计结论并不是绝对的。大部分中年妇女会定期做乳腺 X 线检查，以便能及早发现乳腺癌。但是，乳腺 X 线检查真的可以降低女性死于乳腺癌的风险吗？高质量的统计研究发现，对于 50-64 岁的妇女来说，乳腺 X 线检查可以减少 26% 的死亡率。但这个数字是该年龄阶段妇女的一个平均数字。因为总是存在着个体差异，所以对于不同的妇女来说，结果可能大不相同。有些每年做乳腺 X 线检查的妇女最后却死于乳腺癌，也有一辈子没做过这种检查的妇女却活到了 100 岁，最终死于车祸。

该报告事实上说的是，「乳腺 X 线检查可以将乳腺癌死亡率减少 26%（置信度为 95%，置信区间为 17-34%）」。而根据尼尔森的观点，26% 这个数字是「某个范围的简化说法，这个范围描述了我们对现时情况的实际了解程度」。在这个案例当中，这个范围是 17-34%，而且我们对它有 95% 的把握。也就是说，我们相当有把握，但不是百分之百确定。当你阅读新闻报道时，可以找找看有没有诸如「95% 的置信度」或「有统计学显著性」等字眼，如果有，就代表这个研究结果虽不能说百分之百确定，但有很大的把握。

### 0102. 主题卡 —— 统计思维的四个组件

What Lies Ahead in This Book. This isn’t a book about the tools of statistics. It is a book about statistical ideas and their impact on everyday life, public policy, and many different fields of study. You will learn some tools, of course. Life will be easier if you have in hand a calculator with built-in statistical functions. Specifically, you need a calculator that will find means, standard deviations, and correlations. Look for a calculator that claims to do「two-variable statistics」or mentions「correlation.」If you have access to a computer with statistical software, so much the better. On the other hand, you need little formal mathematics. If you can read and use simple equations, you are in good shape. Be warned, however, that you will be asked to think. Thinking exercises the mind more deeply than following mathematical recipes. Statistics: Concepts and Controversies presents statistical ideas in four parts:

1『数据分布的 3 个关键参数出来了：平均值、方差和相关性（拟合度）。（2020-11-21）』

1 Data production describes methods for producing data that can give clear answers to specific questions. Where the data come from really is important — basic concepts about how to select samples and design experiments are the most influential ideas in statistics.

2 Data analysis concerns methods and strategies for exploring, organizing, and describing data using graphs and numerical summaries. You can learn to look at data intelligently even with quite simple tools.

3 Probability is the language we use to describe chance, variation, and risk. Because variation is everywhere, probabilistic thinking helps separate reality from background noise.

4 Statistical inference moves beyond the data in hand to draw conclusions about some wider universe, taking into account that variation is everywhere and that conclusions are uncertain.

Ultimately, data are used to draw conclusions or make decisions. The process of reasoning from data consists of several steps that yield a case for the validity of the final conclusion. Each part of this book discusses issues that affect the quality of the steps in this process. It is easy to focus on mastering the details in each chapter and lose track of how these details contribute to the overall argument. To help you see how the individual chapters fit into the overall argument, we end each chapter with a section that we call Link It, which briefly describes how the contents of the chapter fit into the overall reasoning process. You will find this section within the Statistics in Summary subsection.

Statistical ideas and tools emerged only slowly from the struggle to work with data. Two centuries ago, astronomers and surveyors faced the problem of combining many observations that, despite the greatest care, did not exactly match. Their efforts to deal with variation in their data produced some of the first statistical tools. As the social sciences emerged in the nineteenth century, old statistical ideas were transformed and new ones were invented to describe the variation in individuals and societies. The study of heredity and of variable populations in biology brought more advances. The first half of the twentieth century gave birth to statistical designs for producing data and to statistical inference based on probability. By midcentury, it was clear that a new discipline had been born. As all fields of study place more emphasis on data and increasingly recognize that variability in data is unavoidable, statistics has become a central intellectual method. Every educated person should be acquainted with statistical reasoning. Reading this book will enable you to make that acquaintance.

统计学与你

这不是一本关于统计工具的书，本书写的是统计学的观点及其对日常生活、公共政策和其他不同研究领域的影响。当然，你将会从本书中学到一些统计工具。如果你手上有一台内置了统计功能的计算器，你的生活将会容易很多，特别是这台计算器可以计算平均值、标准差和相关系数。找一台可以做「双变量统计」或「相关性分析」的计算器，如果你的电脑上有统计软件，就更好了。另一方面，你需要懂一点儿数学。如果你理解并会使用一些简单的方程式，就再好不过了。不过要记住，我们要求你学会思考，思考对于大脑的训练要远胜过数学公式。本书将从 4 个方面展现统计学思维方式：

1、数据生产，讨论了数据产生的方法，可以对特定问题给出解决方案。数据来自何处至关重要，关于如何选择样本和设计实验的基本概念，是统计学中最有影响力的内容。

2、数据分析，关注的是收集、组织，以及用图表、数字描述数据的方法和策略。你可以学会使用非常简单的工具聪明地分析数据。

3、概率，是我们用来描述机会、变化和风险的语言。由于变化无处不在，概率思维有助于将现实与背景噪声区分开。

4、统计推断，是指通过我们手中掌握的数据得出结论，考虑到变化无处不在，结论是不确定的。

1-2『看到译者翻译的「变化」，脑子里用「随机」来替代。这里统计思维的四个组件：数据产生、数据分析、概率和统计推断，这四个部分也是本书的骨架，做一张主题卡片。（2021-02-11）』——已完成

最终数据会被用于得出结论或做出决定。本书的各个部分讨论了影响这一过程各个步骤的质量问题。读者很容易把注意力放在每章的细节上，而忽略了这些细节背后的整体图景。为了帮助你避免这种见树不见林的问题，看清楚每章与整体图景的关系，我们在每章结尾处简短地说明这一章在整体图景中的位置。你可以在每章的小结中看到这部分内容。

统计思维和工具在人们处理数据的过程中逐步显现。两个世纪前，天文学家和勘测员面对的问题是，即便把许多观察结果非常小心地拼凑起来，仍然发现它们无法很好地吻合。他们努力处理数据的变化，因而产生了最初的一些工具。当社会科学在 19 世纪出现时，旧的统计思维发生了转变，新思维被发现，用于描述个体和社会的变化。对遗传和生物学总体变量的研究推进了统计学的发展。20 世纪前半叶诞生了建立在概率之上的用于生成数据和进行统计推断的统计设计。直到 20 世纪中期，人们才清楚地看到了一门新学科的诞生。由于所有研究领域都更加注重数据，而且越来越明显地意识到数据变化是无法避免的，统计学已经成为核心知识。每个受过教育的人都应该了解统计推断，阅读本书，能够让你掌握这方面的知识。

### 0103. 主题卡 —— 数据的两个来源

In reasoning from data to a conclusion, we start with the data. Where the data come from is the first step in the argument. The nature and validity of the conclusion are affected by this first step. Two sources of data are observational studies and experiments. Observational studies are best suited for a conclusion that involves describing some group or situation without disturbing the scene we observe. Sample surveys are a type of observational study in which we draw conclusions about a population by observing only a part of the population (the sample). Experiments are best suited for a conclusion that involves determining if a treatment causes a change in a response.

2『数据的两个来源：观察研究和试验，做一张主题卡片，需要后续不断补充信息。（2021-02-11）』——已完成

In the next several chapters, we discuss these sources of data in more detail. We will see what makes for a good observational study and for a good experiment. And we will see how a bad observational study or experiment undermines the validity of the conclusions we wish to make.

在依靠数据信息推导出结论的过程中，我们面临的第一个问题就是数据来自何处。统计研究结论的本质和有效性都取决于这一点。数据来自两个渠道：观察研究和实验。观察研究适合在无干扰的情况下描述某个群体或状况并得出结论。抽样调查是一种观察研究，我们通过观察总体的一部分（样本），得出有关总体的结论。实验适用于判断一种处理是否会产生不同的反应。在后面几章，我们将更深入地讨论数据的来源。我们将会看到怎样进行良好的观察研究和实验，我们还会看到糟糕的观察研究或实验是如何破坏我们想要获得的结论的有效性的。

## To the Teacher

### 01. Statistics as a Liberal Discipline

Statistics: Concepts and Controversies (SCC) is a book on statistics as a liberal discipline, that is, as part of the general education of「nonmathematical」students. The book grew out of one of the author’s experiences in developing and teaching a course for freshmen and sophomores from Purdue University’s School of Liberal Arts. We are pleased that other teachers have found SCC useful for unusually diverse audiences, extending as far as students of philosophy and medicine. This tenth edition is a revision of the text, with several new features. It retains, however, the goals of the original: to present statistics not as a technical tool but as part of the intellectual culture that educated people share.

这是一本写给文科类学生的统计学教科书，也就是说，它是非数学专业学生通识教育的一部分。本书的内容，以本书作者之一在普渡大学文学院为一、二年级学生授课的经验为基础发展而来。我们很高兴地发现，其他教师也认为本书对于各类学生都有用处，甚至对哲学和药学专业的学生也是如此。本书第 8 版修订了文字，也增加了新的内容，但是目标仍和原版相同：不是把统计学当作技术工具展示给大家，而是作为受过教育的人应有的知识素养。

### 02. Statistics among the liberal arts

Statistics has a widespread reputation as the least liberal of subjects. When statistics is praised, it is most often for its usefulness. Health professionals need statistics to read accounts of medical research; managers need statistics because efficient crunching of numbers will find its way to the bottom line; citizens need statistics to understand opinion polls and government statistics such as the unemployment rate and the Consumer Price Index. Because data and chance are omnipresent, as our propaganda line goes, everyone will find statistics useful, and perhaps even profitable.

This is true. We would even argue that for most students, the conceptual and verbal approach in SCC is better preparation for future encounters with statistical studies than the usual methods-oriented introduction. The joint curriculum committee of the American Statistical Association and the Mathematical Association of America recommends that any first course in statistics「emphasize the elements of statistical thinking」and feature「more data and concepts, fewer recipes and derivations.」SCC does this, with the flavor appropriate to a liberal education: more concepts, more thinking, only simple data, fewer recipes, and no formal derivations. 

There is, however, another justification for learning about statistical ideas: statistics belongs among the liberal arts. A liberal education emphasizes fundamental intellectual skills, that is, general methods of inquiry that apply in a wide variety of settings. The traditional liberal arts present such methods: literary and historical studies, the political and social analysis of human societies, the probing of nature by experimental science, the power of abstraction and deduction in mathematics. The case that statistics belongs among the liberal arts rests on the fact that reasoning from uncertain empirical data is a similarly general intellectual method. Data and chance, the topics of this book, are pervasive aspects of our experience. Though we employ the tools of mathematics to work with data and chance, the mathematics implements ideas that are not strictly mathematical. In fact, psychologists argue convincingly that mastering formal mathematics does little to improve our ability to reason effectively about data and chance in everyday life.

SCC is shaped, as far as the limitations of the authors and the intended readers allow, by the view that statistics is an independent and fundamental intellectual method. The focus is on statistical thinking, on what others might call quantitative literacy or numeracy.

统计学是人文科学的一部分

作为最不「文科」的学科，统计学的这一名声已被广泛传播，要是有人说它的好话，多半是在说它的用处。医疗保健领域的专业人员必须拥有统计学知识，才能阅读医学研究报告；经理人也要懂统计学，因为需要对大量的数字进行统计分析，才能看得出所以然。普通老百姓只有了解统计学，才能看懂民意调查结果和政府发布的统计数据，例如失业率和居民消费价格指数（CPI）。因为数据和机会无处不在，所以本书的宣传语可以这样写：每个人都用得上的统计学，读者可以从中获利多多。

这些都是事实。我甚至可以说，对于大多数学生来说，本书的通俗讲法要比一般教科书采用的以介绍方法为主的方式更能够为他们将来的统计学研究打好基础。美国统计协会和美国数学协会的联合课程委员会，就建议任何统计学入门课程都应该「强调如何进行统计思考」，而且要体现出「更多的数据和概念，少一点儿公式和推导过程」。本书就是这样做的，其风格贴近文科教育：更多的概念、更多的思考、简单的数据、很少的公式，而且没有正式的推导过程。

应该掌握统计学的另一个理由是：统计学实际上属于人文学科。人文教育强调基本的知识技能，也就是适用于各种领域的通用分析方法。传统人文学科展示了这样的方法：文学和历史研究，政治和人类社会的社会分析，认识大自然的实验科学，数学中的抽象和演绎。之所以将统计学归入人文学科，是基于这样一个事实，即用不确定的经验数据推导得出结论，也是一种通用的思考方法。这本书的两个主题 —— 数据和机会，普遍存在于我们的日常经验中。尽管我们使用数学工具来处理数据和机会问题，但这些工具并不是纯数学的。实际上，心理学家提出了令人信服的观点，认为精通正规的数学方法对于提高我们对数据和机会进行有效推理的能力，并没有多大帮助。本书在作者能力和读者可接受的范围内，突出了统计学是一种独立且基本的思考方法的观点。本书的重点在于统计思维，也有人称之为量化或数据分析。

### 03. The nature of this book

There are books on statistical theory and books on statistical methods. This is neither. It is a book on statistical ideas and statistical reasoning and on their relevance to public policy and to the human sciences from medicine to sociology. We have included many elementary graphical and numerical techniques to give flesh to the ideas and muscle to the reasoning. Students learn to think about data by working with data. We have not, however, allowed technique to dominate concepts. Our intention is to teach verbally rather than algebraically, to invite discussion and even argument rather than mere computation, though some computation remains essential. The coverage is considerably broader than one might traditionally cover in a one-term course, as the table of contents reveals. In the spirit of general education, we have preferred breadth to detail.

Despite its informal nature, SCC is a textbook. It is organized for systematic study and has abundant exercises, many of which ask students to offer a discussion or make a judgment. Even those admirable individuals who seek pleasure in uncompelled reading should look at the exercises as well as the text. Teachers should be aware that the book is more serious than its low mathematical level suggests. The emphasis on ideas and reasoning asks more of the reader than many recipe-laden methods texts.

本书的性质

统计学的书，有些专谈理论，有些专讲方法，而本书不谈这些。本书讲的是统计思维和统计推断，统计学与公共政策，以及包括从药学到社会学在内的人文科学的关系。我加入了许多基础的图表和数据分析技术，以使思想更生动，推理更有力。学生通过处理数据，可以学到怎样去思考数据。但是，我们没有让技巧超越概念成为主角，我们的意图是用文字而不是代数来教学，我们鼓励讨论甚至争辩，而不是只教授如何计算。当然，有些计算仍然是必要的。本书涵盖的内容要比传统的学期课程更丰富，从通识教育的精神出发，宁可涵盖更广泛也不愿过于追求细节。

虽然本书的风格并不那么正统，但仍然是一本教材。本书内容的编排是为了让学生们系统地学习，而且提供了很多练习，其中有不少需要学生们进行讨论或做出判断。即便那些喜欢从轻松阅读中获得快感的读者，也应该在读完正文后再做做练习。也请教师留意，尽管本书只用到了很简单的数学，但并不是一本轻松的教材。将重点放在观念和推理上，对于读者的要求反而要比通篇都是公式的教科书更高。

### 04. New in this edition

This new version of a classic text fits the current teaching environment while continuing to present statistics to「nonmathematical」readers as an aid to clear thinking in personal and professional life. The following new features and enhancements build on SCC’s strong pedagogical foundation:

Chapter Goals. Each chapter now opens with a brief list of learning goals to prepare the student for what lies ahead. At the end of each chapter, we list Chapter Achievements, which reinforce these main concepts the student has now mastered.

Multiple Variables. The revised Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education (GAISE) report encourages introductory classes to expose students to multiple variable thinking. As a result, we decided to include a short subsection in Chapter 14 that gives students some insight into how relationships between several variables can be investigated graphically.

Examples and exercises. Over one-third of the examples and exercises are revised to reflect current data and a variety of topics. They cover a wide range of application areas, adding interest and relevance for students. New example and exercise topics include Brexit; determining the mood of the nation; digital media use and ADHD; Android vs. iOS; psychology and the 2016 U.S. election; New Year’s Eve in Times Square; one-bedroom apartment rents; political views of college students; three-point shooting; and graduation plans.

Case Studies. Beginning each chapter, Case Studies engage students in real-life scenarios related to the chapter concepts. The Case Study is also used as an opportunity to introduce the chapter’s learning objectives (in nontechnical language) as the tools that students are given to assist in their evaluation of the study. A Case Study Evaluated section at the end of each chapter revisits the chapter opening Case Study with follow-up questions, asking students to evaluate what they have learned from the chapter and to apply their knowledge to the Case Study. At least half the case studies have been updated or changed to include more-relevant topics. New topics include a discussion of estimating crowd size (Chapter 9), how the number of Starbucks in a town is related to home prices (Chapter 15), use of social media (Chapter 21), and political party affiliation and beliefs about freedom of speech (Chapter 24).

Design. The lively and contemporary design integrates colorful figures, vibrant photos, and a dynamic layout to engage students and enhance their understanding of text material.

What’s the Verdict? This new feature describes an interesting scenario followed by a series of questions that challenge students to apply what they have just learned to evaluate some real issue. In some ways, students will mimic the sort of discussion that occurs in many of the chapter examples. These are placed at the ends of selected chapters, but icons appear in the body of a chapter indicating those questions that students are now equipped to answer. An ongoing「What’s the Verdict?」issue might appear in several places within a given chapter and even span several different chapters. Real statistical examples involve multiple concepts in SCC, and as students learn new concepts, these questions can help them come to a fuller understanding of how to assess real examples.

In addition to the new tenth edition enhancements, SCC has retained the successful pedagogical features from previous editions:

Statistical Controversies. These boxed features explore controversial topics and relate them to the chapter material. There is follow-up discussion and a proposed resolution to each of these topics found online at [Statistics: Concepts and Controversies, 10th Edition | Macmillan Learning for Instructors](https://www.macmillanlearning.com/college/us/product/Statistics-Concepts-and-Controversies/p/1319109020), in the Resolving the Controversy section.

Now It’s Your Turn exercises. These appear after a worked example, allowing students to test their understanding. Full solutions to these exercises are provided in the back of the text.

Macmillan Learning Online Resources. At the end of each chapter, we provide a list of resources available from Macmillan Learning that provide additional support for understanding topics in the chapter.

Chapter summaries. The「Statistics in Summary」sections at the end of each chapter now consist of two sections. The first is a bulleted summary of the material presented in the chapter. The second section, titled「Link It,」relates the chapter content to material in previous and upcoming chapters. The goal of this format is to help students understand how individual chapters relate to each other and to the overall practice of statistics.

Check the Basics exercises. Each chapter ends with a series of straight forward multiple-choice problems that test students’ understanding of basic concepts. If students have difficulty with these problems, we recommend they review the basic concepts in the chapter before tackling the chapter exercises.

In the News exercises. From popular news media outlets, these exercises use current events and cite recent data sources.

Applets. An applet icon signals where related, interactive statistical applets can be found on the book’s website.

Exploring the Web exercises. These exercises direct students to investigate topics on the Web and think critically about statistical data and concepts. Available on the text’s website (www.macmillanlearning.com/scc10e).

Technology output screenshots. Most statistical analyses rely heavily on statistical software. In this book, we specifically discuss the use of JMP 12 in some parts. Other software for conducting statistical analysis includes CrunchIt!®, Minitab, SPSS (an IBM Company),1 R, and a TI-83/-84 calculator. As specialized statistical packages, JMP, Minitab, and SPSS are the most popular software choices both in industry and in colleges and schools of business. As an all-purpose spreadsheet program, Excel provides a limited set of statistical analysis options in comparison. However, given its pervasiveness and wide acceptance in industry and the computer world at large, we believe it is important to give Excel proper attention. It should be noted that for users who want more statistical capabilities but want to work in an Excel environment, there are a number of commercially available add-on packages (if you have JMP, for instance, it can be invoked from within Excel). TI-83/-84 calculators are generally sufficient for an introductory course, although most statistical analysis is beyond the capabilities of even the best calculator, so those seeking to continue their learning of statistics should consider learning one of the specialized statistical packages.

1『准备直接用 Python 的统计用的包，哈哈。（2020-11-21）』

Even though basic guidance for JMP is provided in parts of this book, it should be emphasized that SCC is not bound to any program. Computer output from statistical packages is very similar, so you can feel quite comfortable using any one of these packages.

1 SPSS was acquired by IBM in October 2009.

### 05. Tutorial-Style Formative Assessment

### 06. Adaptive Assessment Focused on Fundamental Concepts

Learningcurve. LearningCurve’s adaptive quizzing encourages students to learn through practice. Through gamified elements, students are challenged to gain points by submitting correct answers to meet or exceed an instructor-determined score. Faculty and students are then provided detailed analytics on their performance via their own personal study plan with pathways to additional learning tools and insights. This tool focuses on getting students prepared for their upcoming class.

### 07. Analytics

Instructors can also evaluate an aggregate view of their class’s performance on a problem (item) through our「Item Analysis」tab. They can quickly see what percentage of students got this question correct, incorrect, or unanswered through the progress bar at the top. They can also see all of the student responses rolled up; giving them immediate insight into what their students’ most common misconceptions are on this problem.

了解统计学

### 01. Making Sense of Statistics

Statistics is about data. Data are numbers, but they are not「just numbers.」Data are numbers with a context. The number 10.5, for example, carries no information by itself. But if we hear that a friend’s new baby weighed 10.5 pounds at birth, we congratulate her on the healthy size of the child. The context engages our background knowledge and allows us to make judgments. We know that a baby weighing 10.5 pounds is quite large, and that a human baby is unlikely to weigh 10.5 ounces or 10.5 kilograms. The context makes the number informative.

Statistics uses data to gain insight and to draw conclusions. The tools are graphs and calculations, but the tools are guided by ways of thinking that amount to educated common sense. Let’s begin our study of statistics with a rapid and informal guide to coping with data and statistical studies in the news media and in the heat of political and social controversy. We will examine the examples introduced in this prelude in more detail later.

统计学是关于数据的学问。数据就是数字，但又不仅仅是「数字」，数据是有上下文联系的数字。比如，数字 10.5 本身没任何意义，但是，假如我们听说一位朋友刚出生的孩子体重为 10.5 磅 [1]，那么我们会恭喜她生了一个健康的宝宝。结合数字的上下文联系和个人知识，就可以做出判断。我们知道，体重 10.5 磅的新生儿个头相当大，而新生儿的体重不太会是 10.5 盎司 [2] 或 10.5 千克。因此，上下文联系可以使数字含义明确。

统计学通过数据获取真知灼见并且得出结论，所用的工具是图表和计算。但是，这些工具要在符合常识的思考方式下使用。让我们先快速地了解一下新闻媒体、热门政治和社会争议的数据和统计研究方面的丰富成果，迈出学习统计学旅程的第一步。在后文中，我们将对序言里列举的案例展开更为详细的研究。

### 02. Data beats anecdotes

Belief is no substitute for arithmetic. —— HENRY SPENCER

An anecdote is a striking story that sticks in our minds exactly because it is striking. Anecdotes humanize an issue, so news reports usually start (and often stop) with anecdotes. But anecdotes are weak ground for making up your mind — they are often misleading exactly because they are striking. Always ask if a claim is backed by data, not just by an appealing personal story.

Does living near power lines cause leukemia in children? The National Cancer Institute spent 5 years and `$5` million gathering data on the question. Result: no connection between leukemia and exposure to magnetic fields of the kind produced by power lines. The editorial that accompanied the study report in the New England Journal of Medicine thundered,「It is time to stop wasting our research resources」on the question.

Now compare the impact of a television news report of a 5-year, `$5` million investigation with that of a televised interview with an articulate mother whose child has leukemia and who happens to live near a power line. In the public mind, the anecdote wins every time. Be skeptical. Data are more reliable than anecdotes because they systematically describe an overall picture rather than focus on a few incidents.

We are tempted to add,「Data beat self-proclaimed experts.」The idea of balance held by much of the news industry is to present a quick statement by an「expert」on either side. We never learn that one expert expresses the consensus of an entire field of science and the other is a quack with a special-interest axe to grind. As a result of the media’s taste for conflict, the public now thinks that for every expert, there is an equal and opposite expert. If you really care about an issue, try to find out what the data say and how good the data are. Many issues do remain unsettled, but many others are unsettled only in the minds of people who don’t care about evidence. You can start by looking at the credentials of the「experts」and at whether the studies they cite have appeared in journals that require careful outside review before they publish a claim.

数据胜过逸闻

信仰不能取代算术。—— 亨利·斯宾塞

一则逸闻就是一个引人入胜的故事，它之所以能够深入人心，就在于其内容能打动人。逸闻可以让事情人性化，所以新闻报道通常以逸闻开头（和结尾）。但是逸闻无法用作决策的依据，正是因其内容生动，所以也常常误导我们。我们判断一个说法可信与否的依据，是它是否有数据支持，而不是它是否来自一个动人的故事。

住得离高压电缆太近，是否会导致儿童患上白血病？美国国家癌症研究所花了 5 年时间和 500 万美元，来收集有关这个问题的数据。结果发现，在白血病和暴露在高压电缆产生的电磁场之间没有任何相关性。和这篇研究报告同时发表在《新英格兰医学期刊》上的社评大声疾呼，是时候不要在这个问题上「再浪费我们的研究资源了」。

比较一下两则报道产生的影响：一则是有关历时 5 年、花费 500 万美元的调查研究的电视新闻报道，另一则是对一位能说会道的母亲的电视采访，她患有白血病的孩子恰好住在高压电缆附近。在公众心目中，几乎每次都是逸闻胜出。但事实上，我们应该心存疑问，因为数据要比逸闻更可靠，数据可以系统地描绘出整体图景，而不是聚焦于个别事件。

我还打算补充一句，「数据胜过自封的专家。」新闻行业通常所秉持的所谓公正的立场，就是各找一名正反方「专家」发表简短的评论。我们永远无法知道是否其中一方代表的是整个学科的共识，而另一方则是蝇营狗苟于某些特殊利益的骗子。媒体这种处理冲突的做法使现在的公众认为，对应每一位专家，都有一个持相反观点的专家。如果你真的关注某个话题，就应该尝试从数据中找出结论，还要判断数据的质量是否良好。很多问题确实还未得到解决，但也有很多问题，只在那些不重视证据的人的头脑中才悬而未决。你至少可以了解一下这些「专家」的背景，还有他们引用的研究结果是否曾刊载于那些文章必须先通过外部评审之后才能发表的严谨期刊上。

### 03. Where the data come from is important

Figures won’t lie but liars will figure. —— CHARLES GROSVENOR

Data are numbers, and numbers always seem solid. Some are and some are not. Where the data come from is the single most important fact about any statistical study. When Ann Landers asked readers of her advice column whether they would have chosen to have children again and 70% of those who replied shouted「No,」readers should have just amused themselves with Ann’s excerpts from tear-stained letters describing what beasts the writers’ children are. Ann Landers was in the entertainment business. Her invitation attracted parents who regretted having their children. Most parents don’t regret having children. We know this because opinion polls have asked large numbers of parents, chosen at random to avoid attracting one opinion or another. Opinion polls have their problems, as we will see, but they beat just asking upset people to write in their views.

Even the most reputable publications have not been immune to bad data. The Journal of the American Medical Association once printed an article claiming that pumping refrigerated liquid through tubes in the stomach relieves ulcers. The patients did respond, but only because patients often respond to any treatment given with the authority of a trusted doctor. That is, placebos (dummy treatments) work. When a skeptic finally tried a properly controlled study in which some patients got the tube and some got a placebo, the placebo actually did a bit better.「No comparison, no conclusion」is a good starting point for judging medical studies. We would be skeptical about the ongoing interest in「natural remedies,」for example. Few of these have passed a comparative trial to show that they are more than just placebos sold in bottles bearing pretty pictures of plants.

数据来源非常重要

数字不会说谎，但说谎的人会算计。—— 查尔斯·格罗夫纳

数据是数字，而数字总显得非常可信。其实有的数字是这样，有的却并非如此。任何统计研究中最重要的事，就是数据的来源。专栏作者安·兰德斯问她的读者，如果可以重新来过，是否还会生孩子？回答的人中有 70% 坚定地说「不要」。但是，你对于兰德斯从泪迹斑斑的信中，引述读者哭诉他们的孩子如何像野兽一样的话语，大可一笑置之。因为兰德斯从事的是娱乐业，她邀请读者回答这个问题时，回应最热烈的应该是那些后悔生孩子的父母。大部分的父母并不后悔生小孩。我们知道这个事实，是因为曾经有人对许多父母做过调查，而且为了规避偏见，受访的父母是随机抽取的。民意调查当然也不是没有瑕疵 —— 这点我们后面会谈到 —— 但它仍比邀请有一肚子不满的人来回答问题要好得多。

1『所以数据源的抽取非常关键，不能用「带偏见」的数据。（2021-02-10）』

即使是信誉卓著的期刊，也不一定能对坏数据免疫。《美国医学会杂志》刊登过一篇文章，声称用管子将冷却的液体输送进胃里，可以缓解溃疡症状。这种治疗对病人的确有效果，但那只是因为病人通常会信服医生的权威性。也就是说，安慰剂（placebo，虚拟治疗）发生了作用。后来终于有人产生了质疑，做了有控制组的比较研究 —— 有些病人接受了这项治疗，有些只使用了安慰剂 —— 结果表明安慰剂组（控制组）的「表现」更好。「没有比较，就没有结论」，这是判断医学研究好坏的一个很好的依据。比如，我对于最近突然流行的「自然疗法」就心存怀疑。在这些疗法当中，极少会通过比较实验来证明它们不只是装在贴着漂亮植物图片的瓶子里售卖的安慰剂。

### 04. Beware the lurking variable

I have enough money to last me the rest of my life, unless I buy something. —— JACKIE MASON

You read that crime is higher in counties with gambling casinos. A college teacher says that students who took a course online did better than the students in the classroom. Government reports emphasize that well-educated people earn a lot more than people with less education. Don’t jump to conclusions. Ask first,「What is there that they didn’t tell me that might explain this?」

Crime is higher in counties with casinos, but it is also higher in urban counties and in poor counties. What kind of counties are casinos in? Did these counties have high crime rates before the casino arrived? The online students did better, but they were older and better prepared than the in-class students. No wonder they did better. Well-educated people do earn a lot. But educated people have (on the average) parents with more education and more money than the parents of poorly educated people have. They grew up in nicer places and went to better schools. These advantages help them get more education and would help them earn more even without that education.

All these studies report a connection between two variables and invite us to conclude that one of these variables influences the other.「Casinos increase crime」and「Stay in school if you want to be rich」are the messages we hear. Perhaps these messages are true. But perhaps much of the connection is explained by other variables lurking in the background, such as the nature of counties that accept casinos and the advantages that highly educated people were born with. Good statistical studies look at lots of background variables. This is tricky, but you can at least find out if it was done.

小心潜在变量

我的钱足够我这辈子花了，只要我不买东西。—— 杰基·梅森

有报道说，在美国，设有赌场的县犯罪率较高。有位大学教师说，在线上课的学生比在教室里上课的学生表现好。政府报告强调，受过良好教育的民众比受教育少的民众赚钱多。最好不要太快下结论，而要先问一句：「有没有什么是他们没告诉我的，却可以用来解释这些事？」

1『确实，一定要有这个意识，有没有我们漏掉的信息，就如同飞机弹孔的例子，回来的飞机不等于全部的飞机，那些引擎上中弹的飞机挂了，没飞回来。（2020-11-21）』

有赌场的县的确犯罪率较高，但是在城市或是较穷的县，犯罪率也比较高。什么样的县会开设赌场呢？这些县是否在开设赌场之前，犯罪率就已经很高了呢？在线上课的学生学得比较好，但是和在教室里上课的学生比起来，前者的年龄比较大，底子也比较好，因此他们表现好很正常。受教育程度高的人的确赚钱多，但受教育多的人和受教育少的人相比，平均来说前者的父母受的教育也较多，也比较有钱。而且，前者在更好的环境中长大，上更好的学校。这些有利条件让他们接受到更多的教育，即使他们不接受这么多教育，这些有利条件也可能会帮他们赚到很多钱。

以上这些案例，都涉及两个变量之间的相关性，并且引导我们得出结论，即其中一个变量影响了另一个变量。「赌场会增加犯罪率」和「想变富有就要多读点儿书」，是它们传达的信息。这些信息有可能是正确的，但我们看到的相关性，大部分说不定还可以由隐藏在背景中的一些变量来解释，比如开设赌场的县的本质，以及受教育程度高的人生来就具备的有利条件。好的统计研究会考虑许多的背景变量，这当然需要技巧，不过你至少可以找一找，看它们有没有这样做。

### 05. Variation is everywhere

When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir? —— JOHN MAYNARD KEYNES

If a thermometer under your tongue reads higher than 98.6°F, do you have a fever? Maybe not. People vary in their「normal」temperature. Your own temperature also varies — it is lower around 6 A.M. and higher around 6 P.M. The government announces that the unemployment rate rose a tenth of a percent last month and that new home starts fell by 3%. The stock market promptly jumps (or sinks). Stocks are jumpier than is sensible. The government data come from samples that give good estimates but not the exact truth. Another run of the same samples would give slightly different answers. And economic facts jump around anyway, due to weather, strikes, holidays, and all sorts of other reasons.

Many people join the stock market in overreacting to minor changes in data that are really nothing but background noise. Here is Arthur Nielsen, head of the country’s largest market research firm, describing his experience:

Too many business people assign equal validity to all numbers printed on paper. They accept numbers as representing Truth and find it difficult to work with the concept of probability. They do not see a number as a kind of shorthand for a range that describes our actual knowledge of the underlying condition.

Variation is everywhere. Individuals vary; repeated measurements on the same individual vary; almost everything varies over time. Ignore the pundits who try to explain the deep reasons behind each day’s stock market moves, or who condemn a team’s ability and character after a game decided by a last-second shot that did or didn’t go in.

变异性无所不在

1『其实应该翻译为「随机无处不在」。（2021-02-11）』

当事实改变时，我就改变主意。您呢？—— 约翰·梅纳德·凯恩斯

如果你的舌下温度超过 37 摄氏度，是不是就代表你在发烧呢？也许不是，每个人的「正常」体温都存在差异。你自己的体温在一天当中也会有变化，早上 6 点时稍高，下午 6 点时稍低。美国政府宣布上个月的失业率上升 0.1 个百分点，而新屋开工率下降 3 个百分点，导致股市波动。股市波动常常是不理性的。政府的数据是根据那些给出乐观预测的样本得出的，是好的估计，但不是百分之百的事实。同样的调查再做一遍，结果会有一些差别。和经济有关的因素原本就会上下波动，影响它的因素包括气候、罢工事件、节假日以及各式各样的其他原因。

很多人会像股市一样，对数据的一些微小变化做出过度反应，而事实上这些并不是实质性变化，根本微不足道。以下是全美最大的市场研究公司的领导人阿瑟·尼尔森的经验之谈：

太多商界人士对白纸黑字印出来的数字都深信不疑。他们认为数字就代表「事实」，让他们用「概率」的视角来看事情有点儿困难。他们不了解，数字只是一种简化的表示方法，它描述了一个范围，这个范围表明我们在现有情况下对某个问题的实际了解有多少。

1『尼尔森的话太精辟了。数字只是一种简化的表示方法，只能描述事实的一个范围，而这个范围只是表明了我们在现有的信息下，对某个问题实际了解的程度。随机性无处不在，做一张主题卡片。回复：此时此刻再看，还是很震撼，数字只是一种简化的表示方法。（2021-02-10）』——已完成

变异性无所不在。个体之间有差别，对同一个个体多测量几次，结果也会不一样，并且几乎每件事都会随着时间的变化而变化。至于一些所谓的专家对每天股市变化背后的深入原因分析，或者对一场其实是最后一秒才定输赢的球赛，却硬要归咎于输球球队的能力或战术，你尽可以对这些嗤之以鼻。

### 06. Conclusions are not certain

As far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality they are not certain, and as far as they are certain they do not refer to reality. —— ALBERT EINSTEIN

Because variation is everywhere, statistical conclusions are not certain. Most women who reach middle age have regular mammograms to detect breast cancer. Do mammograms really reduce the risk of dying of breast cancer? Statistical studies of high quality find that mammograms reduce the risk of death in women aged 50 to 64 years by 26%. That’s an average over all women in the age group. Because variation is everywhere, the results are different for different women. Some women who have mammograms every year die of breast cancer, and some who never have mammograms live to 100 and die when they crash their motorcycles.

What the summary study actually said was「mammography reduces the risk of dying of breast cancer by 26 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 17 to 34 percent).」That 26% is, in Arthur Nielsen’s words,「shorthand for a range that describes our actual knowledge of the underlying condition.」The range is 17% to 34%, and we are 95% confident that the truth lies in that range. We’re pretty sure, in other words, but not certain. Once you get beyond news reports, you can look for phrases like「95% confident」and「statistically significant」that tell us that a study did produce findings that, while not certain, are pretty sure.

统计结论不是百分之百确定的

数学定律不能百分之百地应用于现实生活，能百分之百地用数学定律来描述的就不是现实生活。—— 阿尔伯特·爱因斯坦

1『爱因斯坦这句话其实很有深意的，目前的理解：数学是完全抽象的逻辑世界，是柏拉图式的世界，可以说数据世界是绝对的，关键是数学定理可以在现实世界里对应于一个个应用，这本身就是奇怪，根本毫无理由的。所以这里爱因斯坦说数据定理不能百分百应用于生活，能大部分应用于生活，我们已经很庆幸了，数学它没有义务跟我们现实生活一一对应。（2020-11-21）』

因为变化无所不在，所以统计结论并不是绝对的。大部分中年妇女会定期做乳腺 X 线检查，以便能及早发现乳腺癌。但是，乳腺 X 线检查真的可以降低女性死于乳腺癌的风险吗？高质量的统计研究发现，对于 50-64 岁的妇女来说，乳腺 X 线检查可以减少 26% 的死亡率。但这个数字是该年龄阶段妇女的一个平均数字。因为总是存在着个体差异，所以对于不同的妇女来说，结果可能大不相同。有些每年做乳腺 X 线检查的妇女最后却死于乳腺癌，也有一辈子没做过这种检查的妇女却活到了 100 岁，最终死于车祸。

该报告事实上说的是，「乳腺 X 线检查可以将乳腺癌死亡率减少 26%（置信度为 95%，置信区间为 17-34%）」。而根据尼尔森的观点，26% 这个数字是「某个范围的简化说法，这个范围描述了我们对现时情况的实际了解程度」。在这个案例当中，这个范围是 17-34%，而且我们对它有 95% 的把握。也就是说，我们相当有把握，但不是百分之百确定。当你阅读新闻报道时，可以找找看有没有诸如「95% 的置信度」或「有统计学显著性」等字眼，如果有，就代表这个研究结果虽不能说百分之百确定，但有很大的把握。

1-2『上面的信息补充进主题卡片「Variatioan is everywhere」，其实到现在「置信度」的概念还是没弄明白。（2021-02-11）』

### 07. Data reflect social values

It’s easy to lie with statistics. But it is easier to lie without them. —— FREDERICK MOSTELLER

Good data do beat anecdotes. Data are more objective than anecdotes or loud arguments about what might happen. Statistics certainly lies on the factual, scientific, rational side of public discourse. Statistical studies deserve more weight than most other evidence about controversial issues. There is, however, no such thing as perfect objectivity. Statistics shares a social context that influences what we decide to measure and how we measure it.

Suicide rates, for example, vary greatly among nations. It appears that much of the difference in the reported rates is due to social attitudes rather than to actual differences in suicide rates. Counts of suicides come from death certificates. The officials who complete the certificates (details vary depending on the state or nation) can choose to look more or less closely at, for example, drownings and falls that lack witnesses. Where suicide is stigmatized, deaths are more often reported as accidents. Countries that are predominantly Catholic have lower reported suicide rates than others, for example. Japanese culture has a tradition of honorable suicide as a response to shame. This tradition leads to better reporting of suicide in Japan because it reduces the stigma attached to suicide. In other nations, changes in social values may lead to higher suicide counts. It is becoming more common to view depression as a medical problem rather than a weakness of character and suicide as a tragic end to the illness rather than a moral flaw. Families and doctors then become more willing to report suicide as the cause of death.

Social values influence data on matters less sensitive than suicide. The percentage of people who are unemployed in the United States is measured each month by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, using a large and very professionally chosen sample of people across the country. But what does it mean to be「unemployed」? It means that you don’t have a job even though you want a job and have actively looked for work in the last four weeks. If you went four weeks without seeking work, you are not unemployed; you are「out of the labor force.」This definition of unemployment reflects the value we attach to working. A different definition might give a very different unemployment rate.

Our point is not that you should mistrust the unemployment rate. The definition of「unemployment」has been stable over time, so that we can see trends. The definition is reasonably consistent across nations, so that we can make international comparisons. The data are produced by professionals free of political interference. The unemployment rate is important and useful information. Our point is that not everything important can be reduced to numbers and that reducing things to numbers is done by people influenced by many pressures, conscious and unconscious.

数据可反映社会价值

要用统计数据骗人很容易。但如果不用统计数据，骗人就更容易了。—— 弗里德里克·莫斯特勒

好的数据确实胜过逸闻。比起逸闻和大声争论未来会发生什么，数据要客观得多。和其他的公开论述相比，统计数据建立在事实的基础上，而且比较科学和理性。对于存在争议的话题，统计数据应该比其他大部分证据受到更多的重视。不过，世界上没有百分之百客观这回事。社会环境会影响我们关于度量什么以及如何度量的决策，从而影响到统计数据。

以自杀率为例，它在不同国家之间有很大的差别。各国公布的自杀率之所以存在差别，似乎大部分要归因于社会观念，而不是因为自杀率真的有差别。自杀人数是根据死亡证明书计算的。填写死亡证明书（证明书上的细节在不同的国家或不同的州之间有所不同）的官员，对于诸如没有目击证人的溺死或摔死事件，可以决定其是否算作自杀。在视自杀为耻辱的地方，就有较多的自杀被报告为意外死亡。比如，在大部分人信奉天主教的国家，其公布的自杀率就比其他国家低。在日本文化中，有遇到羞辱时就光荣自杀的传统，这种传统使人们不太将自杀视为耻辱，因此日本的自杀事件被报道的比例较高。在有些国家，因为社会价值观的改变，使得自杀事件的数量在增加。一个越来越普遍的看法是，抑郁症应该被视为生理上的疾病，而不是人性的弱点，自杀是这种疾病的悲剧性结局，而不是道德瑕疵。因此，死者家属和医生愿意把自杀列为死者的死因。

在不像自杀那么敏感的问题上，社会价值观依然可能会影响统计数据。美国的失业率是每个月由美国劳工部劳工统计局用一个很大而且很专业的全国性样本计算出来的。但是，「失业」的定义是什么呢？它指的是，虽然你想工作却没有工作，而且过去两周在积极找工作。如果你过去两周没在找工作，你就不算失业人员，而只是「非劳动人口」。这样去定义失业率，反映了我们加诸工作的价值观。如果换一种定义，我们可能就会得到不一样的失业率数字。

1『印象中，失业率的数据上，特朗普就玩过这种文字游戏。（2020-11-21）』

我的意思并不是叫你不要相信失业率数字。失业率的定义已经使用了好一段时间，在各个国家之间，这个定义也大致吻合，所以我们可以在国家间做比较。失业率是由不受政治干扰的专业人士计算出来的，是重要且有用的信息。我要强调的是，并不是每件重要的事都可以用数字表示。此外把事情简化为数字的人，会受到各种压力的影响，不管有意的还是无意的。

### 08. Statistics and You

What Lies Ahead in This Book. This isn’t a book about the tools of statistics. It is a book about statistical ideas and their impact on everyday life, public policy, and many different fields of study. You will learn some tools, of course. Life will be easier if you have in hand a calculator with built-in statistical functions. Specifically, you need a calculator that will find means, standard deviations, and correlations. Look for a calculator that claims to do「two-variable statistics」or mentions「correlation.」If you have access to a computer with statistical software, so much the better. On the other hand, you need little formal mathematics. If you can read and use simple equations, you are in good shape. Be warned, however, that you will be asked to think. Thinking exercises the mind more deeply than following mathematical recipes. Statistics: Concepts and Controversies presents statistical ideas in four parts:

1『数据分布的 3 个关键参数出来了：平均值、方差和相关性（拟合度）。（2020-11-21）』

1 Data production describes methods for producing data that can give clear answers to specific questions. Where the data come from really is important — basic concepts about how to select samples and design experiments are the most influential ideas in statistics.

2 Data analysis concerns methods and strategies for exploring, organizing, and describing data using graphs and numerical summaries. You can learn to look at data intelligently even with quite simple tools.

3 Probability is the language we use to describe chance, variation, and risk. Because variation is everywhere, probabilistic thinking helps separate reality from background noise.

4 Statistical inference moves beyond the data in hand to draw conclusions about some wider universe, taking into account that variation is everywhere and that conclusions are uncertain.

Ultimately, data are used to draw conclusions or make decisions. The process of reasoning from data consists of several steps that yield a case for the validity of the final conclusion. Each part of this book discusses issues that affect the quality of the steps in this process. It is easy to focus on mastering the details in each chapter and lose track of how these details contribute to the overall argument. To help you see how the individual chapters fit into the overall argument, we end each chapter with a section that we call Link It, which briefly describes how the contents of the chapter fit into the overall reasoning process. You will find this section within the Statistics in Summary subsection.

Statistical ideas and tools emerged only slowly from the struggle to work with data. Two centuries ago, astronomers and surveyors faced the problem of combining many observations that, despite the greatest care, did not exactly match. Their efforts to deal with variation in their data produced some of the first statistical tools. As the social sciences emerged in the nineteenth century, old statistical ideas were transformed and new ones were invented to describe the variation in individuals and societies. The study of heredity and of variable populations in biology brought more advances. The first half of the twentieth century gave birth to statistical designs for producing data and to statistical inference based on probability. By midcentury, it was clear that a new discipline had been born. As all fields of study place more emphasis on data and increasingly recognize that variability in data is unavoidable, statistics has become a central intellectual method. Every educated person should be acquainted with statistical reasoning. Reading this book will enable you to make that acquaintance.

统计学与你

这不是一本关于统计工具的书，本书写的是统计学的观点及其对日常生活、公共政策和其他不同研究领域的影响。当然，你将会从本书中学到一些统计工具。如果你手上有一台内置了统计功能的计算器，你的生活将会容易很多，特别是这台计算器可以计算平均值、标准差和相关系数。找一台可以做「双变量统计」或「相关性分析」的计算器，如果你的电脑上有统计软件，就更好了。另一方面，你需要懂一点儿数学。如果你理解并会使用一些简单的方程式，就再好不过了。不过要记住，我们要求你学会思考，思考对于大脑的训练要远胜过数学公式。本书将从 4 个方面展现统计学思维方式：

1、数据生产，讨论了数据产生的方法，可以对特定问题给出解决方案。数据来自何处至关重要，关于如何选择样本和设计实验的基本概念，是统计学中最有影响力的内容。

2、数据分析，关注的是收集、组织，以及用图表、数字描述数据的方法和策略。你可以学会使用非常简单的工具聪明地分析数据。

3、概率，是我们用来描述机会、变化和风险的语言。由于变化无处不在，概率思维有助于将现实与背景噪声区分开。

4、统计推断，是指通过我们手中掌握的数据得出结论，考虑到变化无处不在，结论是不确定的。

1-2『看到译者翻译的「变化」，脑子里用「随机」来替代。这里统计思维的四个方式：数据产生、数据分析、概率和统计推断，这四个部分也是本书的骨架，做一张主题卡片。（2021-02-11）』——已完成

最终数据会被用于得出结论或做出决定。本书的各个部分讨论了影响这一过程各个步骤的质量问题。读者很容易把注意力放在每章的细节上，而忽略了这些细节背后的整体图景。为了帮助你避免这种见树不见林的问题，看清楚每章与整体图景的关系，我们在每章结尾处简短地说明这一章在整体图景中的位置。你可以在每章的小结中看到这部分内容。

统计思维和工具在人们处理数据的过程中逐步显现。两个世纪前，天文学家和勘测员面对的问题是，即便把许多观察结果非常小心地拼凑起来，仍然发现它们无法很好地吻合。他们努力处理数据的变化，因而产生了最初的一些工具。当社会科学在 19 世纪出现时，旧的统计思维发生了转变，新思维被发现，用于描述个体和社会的变化。对遗传和生物学总体变量的研究推进了统计学的发展。20 世纪前半叶诞生了建立在概率之上的用于生成数据和进行统计推断的统计设计。直到 20 世纪中期，人们才清楚地看到了一门新学科的诞生。由于所有研究领域都更加注重数据，而且越来越明显地意识到数据变化是无法避免的，统计学已经成为核心知识。每个受过教育的人都应该了解统计推断，阅读本书，能够让你掌握这方面的知识。
