TWO The Museum

「Tufted Titmouse, including Black-crested Titmouse」

(Parus bicolor)

Titmice are social birds and, especially in winter, join with small mixed flocks of chickadees, nuthatches, kinglets, creepers, and the smaller woodpeckers. Although a frequent visitor at feeders, it is not as tame or confiding as the chickadees. It often clings to the bark of trees and turns upside down to pick spiders and insects from the underside of a twig or leaf. The「Black-crested Titmouse」of Texas was until recently considered a separate species.

VOICE: Its commonest call, sung year-round and carrying a considerable distance, is a whistled series of four to eight notes sounding like Peter-Peter repeated over and over.

「Northern Shrike」

(Lanius excubitor)

Unusual among songbirds, shrikes prey on small birds and rodents, catching them with the bill and sometimes impaling them on thorns or barbed wire for storage. Like other northern birds that depend on rodent populations, the Northern Shrike movements are cyclical, becoming more abundant in the South when northern rodent populations are low. At times they hunt from an open perch, where they sit motionless until prey appears; at other times they hover in the air ready to pounce on anything that moves.

Field Guide to North American Birds, Eastern Region

A field guide, in its stand on truth, presentation, scene, cast, thought, and language, fits the classic stand on the elements of style perfectly. Its implied model is one person presenting observations to another, who is in a position to verify them by direct observation.

The reader is not in a library doing research, but in the field looking and listening. Since the field guide assumes a scene in which the reader is in the field, it cannot be written in a style that requires study or rereading. It strives to be brief and efficient. It seeks to present the birds it describes specifically and precisely enough for the reader to recognize them.

The writing in a good field guide is certainly the product of deliberation and revision but sounds like ideal spontaneous speech, as if an accomplished companion in the field wanted to tell you something. There is a symmetry between writer and reader: although the writer knows more about the subject than the reader, the reader would know exactly what the writer knows had he seen what the writer has seen in the past. And the guide's purpose is to put the reader in a position to achieve that parity.

The writer needs nothing from the reader. The writer's purpose is purely the presentation of truth. Neither writer nor reader has a job to do. The writer writes and the reader reads not for the sake of some external task — solving a problem, making money, winning a case, getting a rebate, selling insurance, fixing a machine — but rather for the sake of the subject — in this case, the birds — and for the sake of being united in recognizing the truth of this subject. The writer takes the pose of full knowledge, since nothing could be more irksome to someone in the field than a passage clotted with hedges about the writer's impotence.

The entries in the Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Birds, Eastern Region, come as close to classic style in its pure form as anything we have found. In classic style, the model is one person talking to another to present something they both can perceive. A field guide does not perfectly coincide with that model since it is writing, not speech, and the two people are not literally together, but otherwise it fits the classic model closely. Field guides are particularly remarkable for their unfailing refusal to draw attention to their prose. A phrase such as「not as tame or confiding」in the presentation of the tufted titmouse or a sentence like「Unusual among songbirds, shrikes prey on small birds and rodents, catching them with the bill and sometimes impaling them on thorns or barbed wire for storage」in the presentation of the northern shrike is a masterpiece of expression, but refuses to acknowledge that it is anything other than the one inevitable way to present the subject. The prose suggests the same clarity and inevitability as the complex and wonderful but unambiguous and uncontrived presence of the species it describes. There is no more suggestion of deliberation or effort in writing about the tufted titmouse or the northern shrike than there is in seeing one. Writing is assimilated to seeing. There is no more struggle in writing than there is in seeing.

The passages in the Audubon Field Guide assume without hesitation that of course the reader is interested in birds. All details are presented at an equal level of importance. The entire passage is in close focus. The entry for the hairy woodpecker notes that it destroys insects such as wood-boring beetles,「which it extracts from holes with its barbed tongue. Like other woodpeckers, it hammers on a dead limb as part of its courtship ceremony and to proclaim its territory.」The speaker shows not the slightest diffidence or embarrassment about reporting that the call note of the hairy woodpecker「is a sharp, distinctive peek,」or that the western meadowlark and the eastern meadowlark「are so similar that it was not until 1844 that Audubon noticed the difference and named the western bird neglecta because it had been overlooked for so long.」The writer takes the stand that he is simply presenting truth and is being neither cute nor partisan when he reports that「The song of the Western Meadowlark is often heard on Hollywood sound tracks even when the movie setting is far from the bird's range.」There is nothing self-conscious in his matching of language to thought, so there is no hint of fear or shyness in the way he puts his vocabulary to work in descriptions, such as the following account of the western meadowlark's call:「rich, flute-like jumble of gurgling notes, usually descending the scale; very different from the Eastern Meadowlark's series of simple, plaintive whistles.」The speaker never overshoots or undershoots, but always hits his mark. The tone is as it must be. There is nothing for the writer to be defensive about.

「Dragoon Tie」

In the late 16th century, a European mounted soldier who fought as a light cavalryman on attack and as a dismounted infantryman on defense was called a「dragoon.」The term was derived from his weapon, a type of carbine or short musket called the「dragoon.」In the early wars of Frederick II the Great of Prussia in the 18th century,「dragoon」referred to the medium cavalry. The light cavalry of the British army, for the most part, was called「light dragoon」in the 18th and 19th centuries. The term and function disappeared, as did the cavalry, in the 20th century.

The dragoon image used on our exclusive silk twill tie is taken from a design on a 17th-century pewter cap ornament in the Military History exhibit in the National Museum of American History.

— The text of a small card presenting the dragoon tie in the gift shop of the National Museum of American History, 1991

An actual scene is unclassic when the writer wants or needs something from the reader. The classic writer never explicitly argues for the reader's agreement, never overtly solicits a reader's vote or ostensibly engages in salesmanship at any level. He does not write to convince his reader of anything or to lead his reader to any action; he does not write for any practical purpose at all. He is simply presenting an interesting truth. It may be that certain judgments or actions must fall out as a natural consequence of this truth, but in such cases, truth alone is sufficient to ensure the judgment or the action.

Writers in professional or business worlds who want something from readers normally use practical style. Technical manuals, sales pitches, political arguments, undergraduate essays, computer instructions, op-ed pieces, and the great range of prose that attempts to get our attention so it can push us and pull us is typically written in at least an attempt at practical style.

There are reasons for this. When someone wants something from us, we are not necessarily disposed to listen, and certainly not disposed to listen to every detail. Practical style is designed to allow skimming and to excuse the reader as much as possible from having to make an effort. If the writer knows that the reader is plowing through hundreds of similar documents, is weary and perhaps even bored, is skimming the writing and for reasons of either incapacity or disposition simply cannot be made to pay attention to the details of the writing, practical style is almost a necessity.

Yet classic style can be extraordinarily effective in cases where the actual scene conflicts with the model scene of classic style. Classic style is a general style of presentation and can present absolutely anything. Adopting the model scene of classic style can have the effect of distracting the reader from the actual scene by suggesting the much more pleasant and distinguished model scene assumed by classic style. This substitution, all alone, can accomplish the writer's actual purposes at one stroke. In the model scene of classic style, someone is simply presenting truth spontaneously, succinctly, and informally. If this model scene can hide the actual scene — which involves some potential conflict of interest between writer and reader, or some reason the reader might not care to give her full attention voluntarily, or some effort by the writer to apply pressure to the reader, or indeed anything other than full disinterested participation by writer and reader in the truth of what is being presented — then the writer has accomplished his goals not by achieving them but rather by assuming a scene in which they are already achieved.

The most persuasive of all rhetorical stances is to write as if one is not trying to persuade at all but simply presenting truth. The most seductive of all rhetorical stances is to write as if of course the reader is interested in what is being presented, as if the issue could never possibly arise. In general, the best rhetorical stance, if one can get away with it, is to speak as if no rhetorical purposes are involved. Properly adopted, this stance accomplishes at the outset the actual rhetorical goals: the reader is interested and persuaded without ever stopping to realize that any effort has been made to interest or persuade her. This rhetorical strategy can be remarkably effective in situations where practical style or oratorical style is more common. It is also much more pleasant than the labor of practical or oratorical style. It flatters the reader by making her an equal, and relaxes the reader by making her part of a disinterested conversation about something really interesting.

Classic style judiciously used to mask practical goals can bring distinction to its subject, its writer, and its reader. The reader plowing through one hundred memos written in practical style may welcome being addressed in classic style, which adopts the stance that reading it is not part of anybody's actual job, but rather something that the reader is interested in and would have no reason to resist.

The exhibit presenting the Smithsonian dragoon tie is an example of classic style used to sell something, but it has one glaring flaw that shows the difference between classic style and practical advertising style. The phrase「our exclusive」is wrong on two counts. First, the classic writer speaks for himself. He does not acknowledge that he is speaking as the mouthpiece of an institution. Instead, he is having a conversation with an equal. Second, the word「exclusive,」although it technically means that the tie can be bought only from the Smithsonian, comes from the lexicon of sales, and calls up immediately in full force the model scene in which a seller is trying to sell something to a customer.

However, if the phrase「our exclusive」were simply replaced with the word「this,」the result would be a passage in classic style. It pretends to be speech. Its purpose is to present an interesting truth. It takes the pose of full knowledge. Someone is simply telling you something interesting about what you are looking at. Everything is in close focus. It assumes a symmetry between writer and reader. Although skillfully written, it refuses to draw attention to the prose. A phrase like「as did the cavalry,」which is an extremely felicitous and understated way of presenting the historical situation in a brief and unforgettable parenthesis, is used as if it came to the writer without deliberation. Of course the reader is interested in the tie, its details, the image on the tie, the materials out of which it is made, the history surrounding it. It follows naturally that the reader might want to have this tie. That the writer is actually trying to get the reader to do something as vulgar as buy the tie is never allowed to surface.

A single revision, substituting「this」for「our exclusive,」turns this passage into classic style.「This」and「our exclusive」are both instances of what syntacticians call「determiner phrases.」The substitution changes nothing at the「phrase-grammatical」or「text-grammatical」level but changes the style, demonstrating that classic style cannot be defined, or distinguished from other styles, by listing its「phrase-grammatical」or「text-grammatical」features. Consequently, a writer cannot be taught classic style by being taught to follow certain patterns of「phrase grammar」or「text grammar.」That is why this book is not an instruction manual in such grammatical procedures. Rather, it is a presentation of the concept of style, the elements of style, and the classic stand on the elements of style. The reader who considers the classic stand will come to see, for himself and through the demonstrations of this museum, that some surface features may derive in certain cases from the classic stand on the elements of style. But these surface features do not constitute the style.

Known locally as Acadiana and more widely as Cajun country, this isolated, dank area is dominated by descendants of French refugees and freed slaves.

Hemorrhoids are actually varicose veins in the rectum.

— First sentence of an anonymous brochure in a medical clinic, 1992

We include this exhibit to suggest the ease with which classic style can be used to present anything. Because classic style is a style of distinction and was used by its seventeenth-century French masters usually for aristocratic concerns, it might mistakenly be thought of as somehow reserved for aristocratic subjects. Quite the contrary. The first exhibit is a front-page report about a current event, the landing of Hurricane Andrew on the Louisiana Gulf Coast. The writer takes the pose of full knowledge and assumes that of course the reader is interested in the subject. All details are in close focus:「Known locally as Acadiana.」

The second exhibit is the opening sentence of an anonymous brochure about everyday medical problems. The writer writes as if his subject must manifestly be important to the reader, as if he is talking about the mystery of the Holy Ghost or the irregular evolution of great wine.「Actually」presupposes that the reader is of course already interested in this subject.

Reflexive principles are sought by analyzing a problem or a subject into a whole sufficiently homogeneous and independent to permit solution of the problem or statement of the subject.

— Richard McKeon,「Philosophy and Method」

Perception has some basic patterns. In one of the most fundamental, we orient to a stimulus and then inspect its finer details. The eye is structured to serve this pattern: our peripheral vision is not very sharp, but it allows us to pick out what we want to pay attention to; we then orient our heads so as to bring the stimulus into the central area of the retina, or fovea, which is a more sensitive receptor, suited to inspecting fine details.

This perceptual pattern is basic not only to all our senses but also to our understanding of abstract concepts. We think of conceptual inspection as structured by it: we pick out a concept, orient to it, then inspect its finer details. This is why we routinely say things like,「Let us now turn our attention to the bond market,」or「He would have seen what was going on if he had bothered to look around.」

Since classic style presents a subject to its reader, it is not surprising that it has an affinity for basic patterns of perception and inspection. Often, the classic writer will view her task as getting the reader to pick out a particular abstract subject, orient to it, and then pay attention to its finer details. It is not uncommon for a classic passage or sentence to mirror this pattern at the grammatical level. When a classic passage gives us a title — The Tufted Titmouse, The Northern Shrike, The Dragoon Tie — followed by text, we can understand it immediately through this image schema: the title lets us pick something out and orient to it; the text will present the fine points.

The first two sentences in this exhibit are structured by this basic image schema of presentation. Conceptually, each wishes to present a subject — the ancients or physics — and then to make a fine observation about that subject. Grammatically, each sentence first refers to the subject and then makes a predication specific to that subject.

The use of this image schema will not ensure a classic style. Suppose these sentences were,「The ancients wished to acquire glory」and「Physics has a history of trying to explain reality.」Both of these sentences orient the reader to a subject and then try to pick out a detail. Both take a pose of full knowledge and avoid distracting hedges. Both have as their model scene one person talking to another. Both are patterned on voice rather than writing. And so on. But they are deficient as classic prose, because classic predication involves fine conceptual distinctions, articulated in a precise vocabulary.

Classic presentation lives and dies by fine conceptual distinctions. The distinctions drawn in our first two exhibits, by Michael Murrin and Richard Feynman, appear to have been carefully chosen. Both convey the impression that to be able to make these fine choices and careful conceptual distinctions, the writer must have acquired a vast wealth of knowledge. They do not draw attention to the learning of the writer, and they do not assume that the reader would have failed to see these truths if he had the writer's experience, but they do convey the impression that these presentations can only be made after a great deal of personal experience, although only the appropriate truth, not the experience, is presented.

The first two sentences of this exhibit risk trying to state the essence of something immensely complicated. Each needs its refined observation. Lacking it, they would be no different from such sentences as「In the ancient world, everybody believed the gods decided everything,」or「Sex has a way of making you feel good」: texts that express shallow knowledge or repeat clichés without authority.

The third selection, from Richard McKeon, is disorienting even though, using conventional stylistic checklists, it is not easy to see why. Manuals of usage usually discourage the passive voice, but putting this sentence into active voice will not make it easier to read. McKeon, the model for the Chairman in Robert Pirsig's Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, often wrote prose that, like Jeremy Bentham's, had to be solved rather than read. Some people thought the quality of his writing helped to create his reputation — narrowly based but tenaciously held — for profundity. When a philosopher is difficult to read, some readers ascribe the difficulty of his literary style to the difficulty of the subject. They expect to encounter thoughts inaccessible to ordinary thinkers in language inaccessible to ordinary readers. Feynman thought he could make quantum mechanics accessible to general audiences; McKeon could make The Hound of the Baskervilles as inaccessible as quantum mechanics. But whatever readers may think about the quality of his thought, reading a few pages of McKeon generally leaves them feeling as if they have been caught in a whirlpool. The reason for this feeling of vertigo is that McKeon was one of those rare writers whose sentences do not respect normal patterns of human perception. This one seems to invite us to understand it through the normal perceptual and conceptual pattern of orientation to a clear subject and then investigation of its fine details, but the reader who tries to understand it in this fashion will find that the subject of presentation never seems to settle down. The sentence seems to ask for repeated orientation with no inspection of detail, giving it a peculiarly confusing circular figure.

Marquette had solemnly contracted, on the feast of the Immaculate Conception, that if the Virgin would permit him to discover the great river, he would name it Conception, in her honor. He kept his word. In that day, all explorers travelled with an outfit of priests. De Soto had twenty-four with him. La Salle had several, also. The expeditions were often out of meat, and scant of clothes, but they always had the furniture and other requisites for the mass; they were always prepared, as one of the quaint chroniclers of the time phrased it, to「explain hell to the salvages.」

When I was a boy, there was but one permanent ambition among my comrades in our village on the west bank of the Mississippi River. That was, to be a steamboatman. We had transient ambitions of other sorts, but they were only transient. When a circus came and went, it left us all burning to become clowns; the first negro minstral show that came to our section left us all suffering to try that kind of life; now and then we had a hope that if we lived and were good, God would permit us to be pirates. These ambitions faded out, each in its turn; but the ambition to be a steamboatman always remained.

— Mark Twain, Life on the Mississippi

Classic prose is a window to its subject. This subject is never displaced by the writer. When the subject is a tufted titmouse, a dragoon tie, Hurricane Andrew, physics, the ancients, or anything that could not possibly be mistaken for the writer, the distinction is simple. When the subject is an event in which the writer has had a part, the distinction is subtler. This distinction is standard in classic literary journalism, in which the writer often reports a scene he experienced: presenting his own role may be part of presenting the scene. When A. J. Liebling writes about learning to eat in Between Meals, he does so from the experiences of a young American university student sampling Paris restaurants instead of going to class. When Twain writes about life on the Mississippi, he does so from the experiences of a boy raised on the Mississippi who imagined becoming a pilot on the Mississippi and who in fact became a pilot on the Mississippi.

Twain the boy and Twain the cub pilot are part of the subject; they are not displaced by Twain the writer. We do not start reading a book that purports to present life on the Mississippi and soon find ourselves mired in a discussion of the psychological turmoil undergone by the writer as he tries to recollect his youth before the Civil War.

When a classic writer presents his own experience, it is neither private nor merely personal. The experiences Twain presents are not private: had you been there, you would have seen what he saw, and his purpose is to put you in a position to see exactly that. It is only accidental that you cannot now visit antebellum Hannibal, Missouri to see for yourself. Similarly, these experiences are not merely personal. You are expected to recognize the truth of childhood ambition he presents and to confirm it from your own experience, or from other people's reports.

In this way, Twain the writer and Twain the possessor of entirely personal experiences are never allowed to displace the subject — life on the Mississippi. Twain the boy and Twain the steamboatman are part of that subject and are presented as such.

Twain was a deeply opinionated man, and in some of his books he argues with an unclassic interest or aggression, but Life on the Mississippi is a work of classic disinterest and disguised assertion. The writer takes the pose that life on the Mississippi is interesting and it occurs to him to tell you about it, spontaneously. He writes as if there is nothing to argue about, only truth that the reader will of course recognize once put in a position to see it. In the wicked little history about explorers and priests, Twain passes off his assertions as mere observations. At his best, Twain is a complete master of such disguise, as in the following passage, which actually argues that those who send an invading army cannot understand at a distance what it is like to be invaded. Twain neither asserts nor doubts his central thesis. He simply presents the manifest differences in outlook between Northerners and Southerners:

In the North one hears the war mentioned, in social conversation, once a month; sometimes as often as once a week; but as a distinct subject for talk, it has long ago been relieved of duty. There are sufficient reasons for this. Given a dinner company of six gentlemen today, it can easily happen that four of them — and possibly five — were not in the field at all. So the chances are four to two, or five to one, that the war will at no time during the evening become the topic of conversation; and the chances are still greater that if it become the topic it will remain so but a little while. If you add six ladies to the company, you have added six people who saw so little of the dread realities of the war that they ran out of talk concerning them years ago, and now would soon weary of the war topic if you brought it up.

The case is very different in the South. There, every man you meet was in the war; and every lady you meet saw the war. The war is the great chief topic of conversation. The interest in it is vivid and constant; the interest in other topics is fleeting. Mention of the war will wake up a dull company and set their tongues going, when nearly any other topic would fail. In the South, the war is what A.D. is elsewhere: they date from it. All day long you hear things「placed」as having happened since the waw; or du'in' the waw; or befo' the waw; or right aftah the waw. It shows how intimately every individual was visited, in his own person, by that tremendous episode. It gives the inexperienced stranger a better idea of what a vast and comprehensive calamity invasion is than he can ever get by reading books at the fireside.

A portrait now in the possession of the descendants of the Kiry clan shows Terukatsu sitting cross-legged on a tiger skin, fully clad in armor with a European breastplate, black-braided shoulder plates, taces and fur boots. His helmet is surmounted by enormous, sweeping horns, like a water buffalo's. He holds a tasseled baton of command in his right hand; his left hand is spread so wide on his thigh that the thumb reaches the scabbard of his sword. If he were not wearing armor, one could get some idea of his physique; dressed as he is, only the face is visible. It is not uncommon to see likenesses of heroes from the Period of Civil Wars clad in full armor, and Terukatsu's is very similar to those of Honda Heihachir and Sakakibara Yasumasa that so often appear in history books. They all give an impression of great dignity and severity, but at the same time there is an uncomfortable stiffness and formality in the way they square their shoulders.

— Junichir Tanizaki, The Secret History of the Lord of

Musashi, translated by Anthony H. Chambers

The classic writer is distinguished by the fineness and accuracy of his sight. Often this sight is literally visual — as when Tanizaki picks out the detail of the left hand in the portrait of Terukatsu. Classic style extends the domain of sight to include all things that are perceptible through the senses or through reason. Tanizaki moves seamlessly from observing the visual details of the helmet, breastplate, and tasseled baton of command to observing the invisible: dignity, severity, formality, and uncomfortable stiffness; conventionally heroic posture; and the cultural and historical frame. We cannot see heroism, cultural moments, or severity in the same way we can see a hand, but classic writers assume that we see them in the same way. The truth Tanizaki recognizes and presents is conceived as public: anyone not blind looking at the painting can see the hand and its unusual distension, once it is pointed out. Similarly, anyone not mentally blind can see the cultural frame, the heroism, the stiffness, and the severity, once they are pointed out. Truth is self-evident; the classic writer need only present it accurately for the reader to recognize and verify it.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

— Thomas Jefferson, Declaration of Independence

Ceux qui ont le raisonnement le plus fort, et qui digèrent le mieux leurs pensées, afin de les rendre claires et intelligibles, peuvent toujours le mieux persuader ce qu'ils proposent, encore qu'ils ne parlassent que bas-breton, et qu'ils n'eussent jamais appris de rhétorique.

[Those who have the best reasoning power, and who order their thoughts best in order to make them clear and intelligible, can always argue most persuasively for what they propose, even if they speak nothing but low Breton and have never learned rhetoric.]

— René Descartes, Discours de la méthode

Truth is pure, eternal, not contingent. Jefferson's sentence hangs there like a star. It is true that his sentence is a response to a particular occasion, but he chooses to meet that occasion with something that does not depend upon occasion. What he expresses is grounded in something that was always there and that will always abide: we are endowed with it by the Creator. It is bedrock, not the result of a process. It is not achieved. It is unalienable and so cannot change.

According to Descartes, truth is not only eternal and independent of any occasion, but also potentially available to anyone — there is no principle of exclusion from knowing truth; there is only natural defect, the mental equivalent of being born blind. Being persuasive does not depend upon special techniques available only to an elite, such as the literate, the educated, the urban, the wealthy, the French. Jefferson agrees that truth is democratic. That is why he can view these truths as「self-evident,」able to be seen by all. A Breton farmer who never went to school and cannot even speak French can be more persuasive than a Parisian professor of rhetoric if his thinking is in better order.

Both sentences express a global optimism. Truth will triumph ultimately and for the most part locally. This optimism is typical of American classic style, as an American cultural attitude.

En montrant la vérité, on la fait croire.

[To present truth is to have it believed.]

— Blaise Pascal, Pensées

Truth can never be told so as to be understood, and not be believ'd.

— William Blake, The Marriage of Heaven and Hell

Pascal, like Jefferson and Descartes, implies that truth is universally accessible: to see it is to recognize it. Who is it that is made to believe truth in Pascal's sentence? The answer is anybody to whom it has been shown, anybody at all, provided that person has a full human endowment. As in Jefferson and Descartes, the perception of truth is independent of social status, education, wealth, or any other qualification. It is not exclusive. What are the local occasions upon which truth can be shown so as to be perceived? What are the particular circumstances under which it can be shown so as to be perceived? The answer is any occasion at all and under any circumstances whatsoever: truth and its perception are not contingent.

The perception of truth is immediately and completely convincing. A trick can be seen with your own eyes and still not be believed. You can see some things that you are convinced cannot possibly be true, a mirage in the desert, for example. There are many things one can see while still being suspicious of sham. But truth is not like this. To see it is to know that it is truth.

To show truth is automatically to persuade. Truth carries its own sufficient force. In this way, truth is inhuman: it is absolutely self-sufficient; it cuts through all human deficiencies; it needs no help from human beings. All it needs to be perceived is an unadulterated human presentation. As in Jefferson, truth is self-evident once shown.

Truth is perfect. It can gain nothing by being perceived. It is therefore disinterested. It has no motive for deception. It cannot present itself falsely because it does not present itself at all. Self-presentation is for human beings. Human beings are not completely visible; we come with packaging. The package is always shaped by human contingencies, temporary interests, and personal desires, and is therefore suspicious. But truth has no package. Any package given to it is false.

What underlies Pascal's statement is the notion that appropriate prose or appropriate presentation is a window: one can see right through it to truth. It is possible to get the presentation wrong, so that truth is not shown, and therefore people do not see it. The window can be warped or dirty or smoked or blocked and thus be a kind of false package. This is a failure of presentation, not a failure of truth. Truth is never deficient in force or power.

Truth cannot fail any test. It can only be misperceived and mishandled. But nothing is lethal to it. It is immortal. It survives any attempt to deface it. The instruments of perception can be perverted, as can the means of presentation, but truth cannot be perverted or even touched by such corruption. It is independent of human purpose. No one can be so perverse as not to recognize truth once it is shown, though anyone can refuse to look at it or refuse to present it.

It requires discipline, but anyone can present truth, and it often is presented. When it is presented, its effect is complete.

Blake's sentence seems a good deal like Pascal's. Stylistically, it introduces a small unexpected sophistication: truth can never be told so as to be understood and not be believed. A plain style version of this sentence is「Truth can never be told and not be believed.」

Blake's sentence introduces a refinement, a qualification, a meditation on the plain version. It introduces a pivotal conceptual refinement in simple words, transporting the assertion to a level of sophistication that the plain style shuns. Such an introduction of simply expressed conceptual refinement is characteristically classic, so Blake's sentence looks classic.

It is not. In fact, it is stylistically ambiguous. The case is complex and unresolvable. Upon consideration, Blake's sentence can be seen to wobble, but the channel between writer and reader is incomplete; the reader cannot even be sure that Blake meant it to wobble. Ostensibly, it seems to present truth as eternal, knowable, not contingent, of no particular occasion. But if we look closely, it might appear to express something quite different. It never says that it is possible to tell truth so that it can be understood at all. Such a view undercuts the classic premise. Blake's sentence makes the premise contingent upon a precondition that might or might not be fulfilled. The sentence is unclassic not because it contradicts the classic view about truth, but rather because what it presents is fluid. It can alternate between the classic and an unclassic view. What is unresolved in this fashion cannot be classic.

Blake's sentence is like a Necker cube: it contains two different figures, and we can watch it shift back and forth under inspection. It is not eternal. It is not stable. It cannot be stabilized. It looks classic, but that appearance is deceptive.

Il faut exprimer le vrai pour écrire naturellement, fortement, délicatement.

[It is necessary to express what is true in order to write naturally, powerfully, sensitively.]

— Jean de La Bruyère, Les Caractères

En vérité [le roi] est admirable et mériterait bien d'avoir d'autres historiens que deux poètes: vous savez aussi bien que moi ce qu'on dit en disant des poètes: il n'en aurait nul besoin. Il ne faudrait ni fable, ni fiction pour le mettre au-dessus des autres; il ne faudrait qu'un style droit, pur, et net. . . .

[The truth is that {the king} is admirable and would certainly merit having historians other than two poets. You know as well as I do what we mean in saying poets. He would have no need of them whatever; it would require no invention, no fiction to place him above the others; it would require only a pure style, clean and straightforward. . . .]

— Madame de Sévigné, letter to Bussy-Rabutin, 18 March 1678

These two passages, by two of the founders of French classic style, are complementary expressions of the prototypical classic stand on truth, which, in this tradition, is more compelling than any invention and is the natural object of unobstructed human intelligence. Invention requires artifice. Truth, which carries its own conviction, can dispense with sophisticated rhetorical or poetic artifice; it needs only to be presented clearly. Human intelligence recognizes truth naturally. Artifice misleads — that is its purpose. It does so by blunting the natural human sensitivity to truth, and in doing so weakens our natural capacity to perceive what is true.

Truth, then, is natural, powerful, and sensitive; the language that presents it best draws no attention to itself. When we talk about someone's personal style, or the style of someone's prose, we often refer to conspicuous attributes. When La Bruyère talks about writing「naturally,」he is thinking about a style that is anonymous in the way nature is anonymous. The format of a modern book is more natural in this sense than a codex, because, when open, a book is bilaterally symmetrical, as is the human body. A duodecimo book「fits」the hands, and while the modern book is a style of setting out a written text, it is so「natural, powerful, sensitive」that only a textual bibliographer, a binder, or an archivist is likely to be aware of it as a style of presenting a written text.

Classic style is like the form of a book; it can be noticed, but it is not conspicuous. It fits truth the way a book fits the hand. If we can imagine a machine or an extraterrestrial, with no knowledge of the human body, trying to design a format for presenting written prose to human readers, we have an image of La Bruyère's concept of the writer trying to be natural, powerful, and sensitive in the absence of truth. The mechanical or extraterrestial design will be no more natural, powerful, or sensitive to a human reader than a duodecimo volume would be to an intelligent creature with the body of an oyster.

Madame de Sévigné, one of the supreme French masters of classic style, had an exceptional literary education. She read Latin and Italian in addition to French and admired many styles of writing. She loved the allegorical epics of Tasso and Ariosto, as well as the classic prose of Pascal, La Rochefoucauld, Retz, and her close friend Madame de Lafayette. But poetry, in her view, is not a good model for the portrayal of the real virtues of a real king, because poetry「improves」the truth. In seventeenth-century French usage, poésie meant「invented story」as opposed to「true story」: its distinguishing characteristics were artificial ornament and exceptional invention. She therefore deplores the fact that Louis XIV has no one to record his victories except two poets who acted as historiographers royal in 1678 when he took Ghent, even though one of them was Racine and the other was Boileau. Madame de Sévigné is not rejecting figural forms of thought and language — metaphor, metonymy, simile, narrative, symbol, various forms of condensing and crystallizing — which are generally indispensable in thought and language and have a central role in classic style when they serve the presentation of truth. She is rejecting rather their use as embellishment, adornment, and artifice meant to「improve」truth. For Madame de Sévigné, poetic ornaments are appropriate for talking about Roland or other heroes of epic and romance, but contemporary reality needs nothing more than a pure, clean, straightforward style. Any ornament would just distract attention from truth, which needs no help, just an unimpeded view.

Three days after the first allied landing in France, I was in the wardroom of an LCIL (Landing Craft, Infantry, Large) that was bobbing in the lee of the French cruiser Montcalm off the Normandy coast. The word「large」in landing-craft designation is purely relative; the wardroom of the one I was on is seven by seven feet and contains two officers' bunks and a table with four places at it. She carries a complement of four officers, but since one of them must always be on watch there is room for a guest at the wardroom table, which is how I fitted in. The Montcalm was loosing salvos, each of which rocked our ship; she was firing at a German pocket of resistance a couple of miles from the shoreline. The suave voice of a B.B.C. announcer came over the wardroom radio:「Next in our series of impressions from the front will be a recording of an artillery barrage.」The French ship loosed off again, drowning out the recording. It was this same announcer, I think — I'm not sure, because all B.B.C. announcers sound alike — who said, a little while later,「We are now in a position to say the landings came off with surprising ease.

The Air Force and the big guns of the Navy smashed coastal defenses, and the Army occupied them.」Lieutenant Henry Rigg, United States Coast Guard Reserve, the skipper of our landing craft, looked at Long, her engineering officer, and they both began to laugh. Kavanaugh, the ship's communication officer, said,「Now what do you think of that?」I called briefly upon God. Aboard the LCIL, D Day hadn't seemed like that to us. There is nothing like a broadcasting studio in London to give a chap perspective.

— A. J. Liebling,「Cross-Channel Trip」

Although I have used the testimony of Elyot's letters and writings to document his encounter with the resurgent Scripturalism of the 1530s and 1540s, the context in which he worked was clearly energized by cultural and historical currents that encompassed considerably more than the issues of doctrine, religious practices, and ecclesiastical sovereignty dividing Protestants from Catholics, exacerbated as these issues were. Elyot himself identified the challenges which he faced and met with his literary enterprise as questions about his commitment to the king's and Cromwell's reforming measures or to the「savor」of「holy scripture.」Yet the successful popularizing and secularizing measures which Elyot took in jointly pursuing his course as a vernacular writer and bypassing religious issues are, I think, to be construed as evidence running with rather than against the momentum of a larger ideological movement — in the first place because popularizing and secularizing were real options for Elyot, and in the second place because he was able to make them work. Given our present state of knowledge, even as advanced by Elizabeth Eisenstein's study of the printing press as an agent of cultural change, we are constrained to deal symptomatically and speculatively for the most part with the complex of energizing developments — in which printing, humanism, and the Reformation figured prominently with social and economic changes — that ushered in the modern era of the book.

— Janel Mueller, The Native Tongue and the Word: Developments in English Prose Style, 1380–1580

The passage from A. J. Liebling follows his account of the Allied invasion of Normandy on 6 June 1944 as he experienced it from an infantry landing craft. The style is recognizably classic. Its model is conversation, its occasion is informal, its tone is relaxed, confident, and unhedged, and it takes the pose that it is presentational rather than argumentative. It actually makes many strong assertions, concerning what D-Day was really like, the nature of institutional reporting, and the reliability of interchangeable mouthpieces who speak from something other than local knowledge and according to the agenda of their institutions. But these assertions are disguised as mere presentations of what would have been evident to anyone present on the little craft.

The passage supplies the accidental information that a reader cannot be expected to have: what「large」means in measuring an infantry landing craft, the number of the crew, the way Liebling was accommodated on board. But there is no gratuitous display of arcane military knowledge unnecessary to the narrative. Nothing is merely the product of the observer; nothing depends on being able to share the writer's personal construal of the evidence; everything depends on being able to share the writer's position.

The anecdote is a reporter's reflection on reporting and rests on a contrast between a description without authority and an experience that Liebling can stand behind. Just as the real artillery salvo drowns out the recording of one on the radio, so Liebling's experience, which he shares with the officers on board the landing craft, drowns out the account of the Normandy invasion as related from a radio studio in London. The force of the anecdote depends upon the position of the writer; the details are marshaled to put the reader in the same position, so he can see for himself what the writer relates.

As befits conversation, the sentences follow one another in a sequence that seems natural and inevitable, but this is a very efficient narrative. On reflection, it is a miniature masterpiece of construction. The complete narrative is a figural argument for Liebling's view of news reporting as set against the B.B.C's. It contains within it, perfectly positioned, a miniature version of the same figural argument — the drowning out of the B.B.C's canned account by the real thing. The global figure of the passage and the local figure of the salvos mirror each other like macrocosm and microcosm. Both figures work by giving the reader a highly imagistic narrative from which he will certainly draw the obvious point. Yet the entire passage sounds spontaneous and conversational. The writer has done all the work invisibly, and the prose does not draw attention to itself or to the writer's work.

Classic style used in this way is not in the least restricted to eyewitness reporting. The passage from Dodd we treated in「The Reader is Competent」works in just this way. It includes a wealth of facts and scholarly machinery, but it presents them as accidental information that merely needs to be supplied to the reader in a sufficiently clear fashion: the reader will then make, with Dodd, the inevitable observations. Dodd's passage, like Liebling's, sounds conversational, confident, unhedged. This appearance of confidence comes largely from the way the writer introduces facts and citations with perfect clarity: neither the facts nor their relations to each other are fuzzy. The way the components stand together is fully formed: the writer knows exactly the relationships he means to present.

Janel Mueller's passage on Sir Thomas Elyot appears in her book on late medieval and renaissance English prose style. The passage is unclassic, not principally for local reasons — the side issues that bury in obscurity the figure structuring the passage, for example — but in its conception of scene, cast, and subject. It is a summary of evidence, but assertive and defensive rather than disinterested. The writer presses for agreement while defending from objection and attack, as if the scene and cast were adversarial, not conversational. If the writer obscures what she has to say as she goes along, it serves a strategic purpose: in the end there will be no clear interpretation to which the reader might respond. This style is best suited to juridical scenes and casts, where winning is everything; it is normally incompatible with the obligations of scholarship. The confusion of scene in Mueller induces an obvious strain, resulting in a conflicted form in which bits of scholarly evidence, vague in themselves, are imprecisely connected to each other, and sometimes not connected at all:「Given our present state of knowledge, even as advanced by Elizabeth Eisenstein's study of the printing press as an agent of cultural change . . .」Scholarly asides are scattered at random, offering the decor of erudition without the justification of scholarly argument.

Liebling, who writes about what you can see and hear, and Dodd, who writes about the most abstract concerns of textual editing and historical interpretation, both write as if the subject they are presenting has a clear existence independent of the writer or the writing. Mueller, on the other hand, writes as if her subjects depend upon the writer for their very existence: Elyot's encounter with「the resurgent Scripturalism of the 1530s and 1540s,」「the context in which he worked,」the nature of the「cultural and historical currents」that「energized」that context. That may be why the word「clearly」in the phrase「the context in which he worked was clearly energized by cultural and historical currents that encompassed considerably more than the issues of doctrine, religious practices, and ecclesiastical sovereignty dividing Protestants from Catholics, exacerbated as these issues were」rings false. Clearly? To whom? Could it be clear to just anyone who reads Elyot's「letters and writings」? Could it be clear to Elyot himself? Apparently not. For the author appears to be disagreeing with Elyot's claims. What he did should be construed, she says, in a certain way, namely「as evidence running with rather than against the momentum of a larger ideological movement.」And it should be construed this way, she claims, tautologically, because it is precisely what he did. The「evidence」she offers is「presented」as dependent upon her「point of view,」and the particular view of the evidence that gives it force is not described in a way that would allow the reader to adopt the writer's perspective. Only the conclusions from that perspective are offered, in a manner so obscure as to place them beyond challenge.

Even though there is an ostensible presentation of evidence in the passage on Elyot, the evidence depends entirely upon the writer's disposition. A skillful practitioner in this style can deflect questions about the validity of such evidence, but in this case, there is a marked strain in trying to establish with precision relationships among abstractions that are themselves shapeless and indefinite. In consequence, the whole passage betrays an understandable anxiety that even the writer might lose sight of her own subject. She must reassure herself that what she is talking about is real, that it matters, that her understanding of it is both defensible and significant, and that the reader is interested. It is not surprising that her anxiety is communicated to the reader.

In mathematics, whose normal subject is precise relationships between abstractions, such problems are rare. The objects, while they are abstract, are as definite as infantry-landing boats, and the evidence for the relationships is precise and publicly accessible in a way that the direction of「the momentum of a larger ideological movement」never can be. The borders of such an ideological movement are not public and definite the way the borders of an isosceles triangle — or the dimensions of the wardroom on an infantry landing craft — are. The strain evident in the passage on Sir Thomas Elyot's career as a vernacular writer is the strain of attempting to talk about imperfectly formed conceptions of invented relationships between indefinite abstractions as if they had the precision and public accessibility of square roots or the complement of officers on a Landing Craft, Infantry, Large. Dodd, because he has thought through thoroughly and precisely the relationships and abstractions he wishes to present, can do so as if he were Liebling writing about one boat bobbing in the lee of another. Classic style is perfectly suited to presenting abstractions, but the classic writer, having thought out the features and borders of abstractions, presents them confidently, without recourse to hedges, contortions, and obscurities that undercut a reader's ability to judge the writer's conclusions for himself.

La grande nouveauté technique de l'artillerie a mis quelque temps à faire sentir toutes ses conséquences. La dotation de l'armée de Charles VIII a suffi à lui ouvrir Milan, Florence, Rome et Naples. Cette «invention diabolique», que devaient stigmatiser l'Arioste et Rabelais après lui, condamnait les méthodes traditionnelles, les parades et les offensives de belles armures. Elle rendait, à long terme, inutile la classe aristocratique dont la guerre était la raison d'être, à moins d'une adaptation qu'il lui fallut cruellement accomplir pendant quarante ans de batailles en Italie et ailleurs. Surtout, l'artillerie va amener une révision complète de la fortification et des systèmes défensifs. Les plus grands architectesingénieurs, Francesco di Giorgio, Giuliano da Sangallo, étudient les plans à redents et des bastions articulés qui modifient la physionomie des murailles et par là assez directement celle des villes. Les études les plus saisissantes seront celles de Michel-Ange pour la défense de Florence en 1529–1530. C'est comme ingénieur que César Borgia eut un moment Léonard à son service. On n'a pas encore complètement mesuré toutes les conséquences de l'évolution de l'art de la guerre à la Renaissance.

[The great novelty of Renaissance warfare, the use of artillery, took some time to make its full effect. Thanks to it Charles VIII had Milan, Florence, Rome and Naples at his mercy. This「diabolical invention」as Ariosto called it (and Rabelais was to denounce it after him) put an end to the traditional mode of warfare, to the dashing charges of knights in armor. And in the end it rendered useless the aristocratic class whose raison d'être was warfare — until it had undergone the re-education provided by four gruelling decades of fighting in Italy and elsewhere. The increased use of artillery led to drastic modifications of the fortifications and defensive outworks of towns, and the greatest experts in this field, Francesco di Giorgio and Giuliano da Sangallo, invented a system of indented traces and articulated bastions which radically changed the aspect of the walls and even the layout of fortified cities. The most remarkable plans were those which Michelangelo made for the defense of Florence (1529–1530), and it was in the capacity of engineer that Cesare Borgia called in Leonardo. The extent to which the evolution of the art of war affected the Renaissance has yet to be fully assessed.]

— André Chastel, Le Mythe de la Renaissance 1420–1520

This passage on the introduction of artillery in sixteenth-century warfare and its effect both on large abstractions such as「the traditional mode of warfare」and on tangible things such as walls and fortifications, in addition to its social consequences — things that in other hands might become「the direction of cultural and social trends energized by the complex of military developments」 — is organized by one short point at the beginning and a complementary one at the end. Everything between them is a careful expansion of the first point, at once supporting it with illustrations and examples and preparing the way for the concluding point. Although this passage of just two hundred words contains references to eight people and four cities, as well as allusions to actual fortifications, to plans for new defenses, and to four decades of fighting in two places (one specified, the other not), in addition to the citation of one epithet and an aside on its later repetition, each of these elements occupies a well-conceived place in the discussion. None of them seems awkward or arbitrary. The erudition does not seem gratuitous or strained; it does not obscure the figure that organizes the passage or obstruct its easy flow. The complexity and obscurity of the subject are not offered as a tacit justification for a complex and obscure presentation.

Palabra por palabra, la versión de Galland es la peor escrita de todas, la más embustera y más débil, pero fue la mejor leída. Quienes intimaron con ella, conocieron la felicidad y el asombro. Su orientalismo, que ahora nos parece frugal, encandiló a cuantos aspiraban rapé y complotaban una tragedia en cinco actos. Doce primorosos volúmenes aparecieron de 1707 a 1717, doce volúmenes innumerablemente leídos y que pasaron a diversos idiomas, incluso el hindustani y elárabe. Nosotros, meros lectores anacrónicos del siglo veinte, percibimos en ellos el sabor dulzarrón del siglo dieciocho y no el desvanecido aroma oriental, que hace doscientos años determinó su innovación y su gloria. Nadie tiene la culpa del desencuentro y menos que nadie, Galland.

[Word for word, Galland's version is the worst written, the most fraudulent and the weakest, but it was the most widely read. Readers who grew intimate with it experienced happiness and amazement. Its orientalism, which we now find tame, dazzled the sort of person who inhaled snuff and plotted tragedies in five acts. Twelve exquisite volumes appeared from 1707 to 1717, twelve volumes innumerably read, which passed into many languages, including Hindustani and Arabic. We, mere anachronistic readers of the twentieth century, perceive in these volumes the cloyingly sweet taste of the eighteenth century and not the evanescent oriental aroma that two hundred years ago was their innovation and their glory. No one is to blame for this missed encounter, least of all Galland.]

— Jorge Luis Borges,「Los traductores de las 1001 noches」

The story of the story of the thousand and one nights is perhaps untellable. The cultural provenance of the tales — indian, Persian, and Arabic — is perhaps irrecoverable. The manuscript traditions of the originals are a nightmare that makes the legendary textual problems of Marlowe's Doctor Faustus look trivial. The constitution of the work — which tales belong to it, or at least which tales belong to which versions of it, and in what order — is fundamentally unsettled. It was disseminated through Europe in the eighteenth century through a series of famous translations whose history is at best complex and subtle, at worst unknown.

These impediments to knowledge might paralyze any writer who allowed his style to be influenced by doubts about his capacity to perform. Additional impediments could plausibly be found in the cultural and personal situation of the writer. Jorge Luis Borges was an elite twentieth-century Latin American classic writer, a librarian, a famous erudite, and male. The Thousand and One Nights, by contrast, comes from traditions that are not elite, not privileged, not scholarly, not twentieth-century, not white, not European or Latin American, and not male: the transmission and perhaps creation of the tales were largely in the hands of women. They were subversive tales recognized as such in their own time, intentionally politically incorrect not just for our age but for their own: they present an onslaught against the very notion of ideological engineering as an effective response to the complexity of human affairs. These tales were introduced to Europeans by English and French men of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

Borges, confronted with this sea of difficulty and separated culturally and personally from the origins of the tales and their translators, nonetheless adopts the classic pose. He presents truth that is generally available. In principle, it could be confirmed by anybody, regardless of cultural identity. He conceives of and presents his subject as existing independently of the writer. He presents it to a competent audience in prose that itself is never allowed to become a subject of the writing. There is a symmetry between writer and reader: like Dodd in considering the textual history of the Fourth Gospel, Borges assumes that in principle anybody could learn what he has learned, and would then see just what he sees. Although Borges is dealing with large abstractions — orientalism, quality in writing, the reception of a text, happiness, the flavor of the eighteenth century, innovation and glory, blame, and extraordinarily complex cultural patterns — he conceives of them as clear and exact. They are as highly defined and visible as cut crystal. None of them depends upon the writer for its existence.

Anything can be presented in classic style, including the cultural and historical situation of the writer and reader, when these are part of the intended subject. Borges presents our situation as twentieth-century readers as part of presenting the truth of these translations and their history. But such matters never displace the chosen subject and never interfere with the performance. Although a classic writer could take as his subject ways in which cultural, historical, and personal situation might make writing impossible, or at least hard, his actual writing would never betray any evidence of the difficulty of which he speaks. He would present clearly, simply, intelligibly, and assuredly the truth that it is impossible to write clearly, simply, intelligibly, and assuredly. He would take the pose that the reader will share his recognition of the truth that it is impossible for the reader to share his recognition of anything.

The Touraine is the heartland of France. It was here, as much as in any other single locality, that the subtle, clear, precise language of modern France developed, and here also, fittingly, that the subtle, fine, expert cooking of modern France developed.

— Waverley Root, The Food of France

Man kann etwas finden, ohne es gesucht zu haben, ja jeder Kunstforscher weiß aus Erfahrung, daß man fast stets etwas anderes findet, als was man sucht. Wer Erdbeeren sucht, weiß, wie eine Erdbeere aussieht, wer aber den Zusammenhang sucht, weiß nicht, wie dieser Zusammenhang aussieht. Die allgemeine Gefahr besteht nun darin, daß Wunsch und Wille, etwas zu finden, vorzeitig im Geiste des Suchenden ein Bild des Zusammenhangs und zwar ein falsches hervorbringen. [One can find something without having sought it — indeed, every connoisseur knows from experience that one nearly always finds something other than what one seeks. When you go looking for strawberries, you know what a strawberry looks like — but when you go looking for interrelationships, you do not know what they will look like. The ever-present danger is precisely that the desire and the will to find something may, in the mind of the seeker, precociously project a connection — one that does not exist.]

— Max J. Friedländer, Die Altniederländische Malerei

The imperfect structural correspondence of painting to literature does not in fact preclude or even severely limit the comparison of the arts. What it does is permit an ever changing set of correlations by painters and writers, who are free to stress different elements of the structures of their art in order to achieve this correspondence. An interartistic parallel thus is not dictated by the preexistent structures of the arts involved; instead, it is an exploration of how these two structures can be aligned. This alignment is part of the overall essential homonymity and synonymity of semiosis by which sign systems and their texts approximate one another and then diverge.

— Wendy Steiner, The Colors of Rhetoric: Problems in the

Relation between Modern Literature and Painting

The passages by Root and Friedländer are classic; the passage by Steiner is not. The difference has nothing to do with the nature of the subjects they treat, but with how those subjects are conceived. Root and Friedländer treat their subjects with a clarity and exactness that makes them appear to be entirely independent of the writers. Steiner treats her subject in a way that makes it dependent upon her for its existence as well as for its expression.

Root treats food and language while Friedländer treats「interrelationships」: food is available to the senses,「interrelationships」to abstract thought, and language to both, demonstrating that classic style is not determined by the nature of its subject. Root says something absurd while Friedländer says something we can all confirm, demonstrating that classic style is not determined by whether what it says is actually true.

What Root says is assured, relaxed, conversational, and classic. It is no less classic for being wrong. The supposed aboriginal「purity」of French in the Touraine is an enduring fairy tale that withstands all contradiction — the shop sign in Tours, for example, that announces「Le Fast-Foud」 — and any claim that modern French cuisine has its roots in the Touraine will provoke outrage from approximately Sens to the southern limit of the Lyonnais. The claim of a relationship between the qualities of a cuisine and the qualities of a language — and, of course, the linguistic qualities Root refers to are qualities of a style, not of a language — must be regarded as doubtful. Many great chefs whose dishes are subtle, clear, and precise speak in a style far removed from that of Pascal and Madame de Sévigné. But Root is not seriously making claims about a relationship between cuisine and language. He is rather offering the disguised assertion that cuisine — as well as literary style — is an important mark of a culture.

Language and cuisine, even if both are limited to their modern French varieties, are large and indefinite domains here confidently subsumed under a deeply entrenched ontological metaphor and so treated as「things」more or less on the order of Friedländer's strawberries. Friedländer, the third director of the great Kaiser Friedrich Museum in Berlin, liked to start with evidence of a primary sort — actual pictures — and subsumed his abstractions to this model, treating them as「things」so clear and exact that it is almost impossible to remember that they are abstractions. He noticed, with characteristic mordancy, that a theorist whose abstractions could not clearly and in detail be separated from his discourse produced students who, like their teacher, invariably saw only what they expected to see, whereas connoisseurs like himself whose abstractions were conceptually independent of their discourse regularly encountered pictures that contradicted all their expectations about the painting of particular times and places.

Steiner's procedure is just the sort of thing that raised his skeptical doubts. Her passage, as it reaches its crescendo, is more and more speculative and impossible to verify by looking at what Friedländer would have regarded as common evidence, particular literary texts and paintings. The classic writer, no matter how abstract his subject, will present it as so sharply defined in itself and so independent of the writer as to count for all of us as a「thing,」with the implication that any one of us will see the evidence for it if only we are placed in the appropriate position. Steiner's passage, by contrast, is fundamentally unclassic because it rejects any responsibility on the writer's part to present its subject as a「thing」independent of the writer. On the contrary, the amorphousness of her subject, its dependence upon her for its existence, and the lack of a symmetry between what she and her reader might be able to see as evidence are valued in her writing as marks of the writer's brilliance instead of the writer's incompetence. The final dance of abstractions between「sign systems and their texts」and「the overall essential homonymity and synonymity of semiosis」that contains the「structures」of literature and painting has lost contact so completely with anything available to classic style as to suggest that Steiner's gifts are at least partly oracular. Root is vulnerable exactly because he has presented something so precise and open to our own verification that anyone who has the good fortune to learn both French and French cuisine can challenge him. Steiner, wrapping her speculations in a rhetorical mantle whose most conspicuous colors are those of jargon, suggests she knows things that the rest of us do not, and so avoids root's vulnerability, but at the risk of claiming for herself a kind of supernatural sight and insight. She suggests she has entered into deep mysteries unavailable to the sort of person who might observe that while painting and literature are not in all respects similar, they can be compared, and that a general inquiry into the subject will yield the not surprising result that painting and literature are similar in some ways and different in others.

「凤头山雀，包括黑冠凤头山雀」（学名：Parus bicolor)

凤头山雀是群居鸟类，尤其在冬季，喜与山雀、五子雀、戴菊鸟、旋木雀以及小型啄木鸟等鸟群混居在一起。虽然经常光顾食槽，但它们并不像黑顶山雀那样温顺或与人亲近。它常常紧抓树皮，从枝叶底下倒挂着啄取蜘蛛和昆虫。得克萨斯州的「黑冠凤头山雀」，直到最近才被认为是一个独立的物种。

声音：它们的鸟鸣声经年不断，传得很远。最常听到的叫声，是一连串四至八个音符的鸣叫，听起来像「彼得 - 彼得」，反复不断。

「灰伯劳」（学名：Lanius excubitor)

与大多数鸣禽不同，伯劳鸟捕食小型鸟类和啮齿类动物，用嚎捕捉到它们后，有时还把它们穿在荆棘或铁丝网上储存起来。

与其他依赖啮齿动物生存的北部鸟类一样，灰伯劳的活动是周期性的，当北部啮齿动物种群数量较少时，它们在南部的活动变得更加频繁。有时它们梧息在树枝上一动不动，静候猎物出现：有时它们在空中盘旋，准备随时扑向任何移动的东西。

—— 约翰·布尔和小约翰·法兰德，《奥杜邦协会北美鸟类野外观鸟指南·美国东部地区》1

野外指南在真相、呈现、场景、角色、思想和语言上的立场，与古典风格对风格要素的立场一致。它的潜在场景是一个人向另一个人呈现观察到的东西，另一个人所在的位置可以通过直接观察加以验证。

读者不是在图书馆做研究，而是在现场边看边听。因为野外观鸟指南假定的场景是读者在野外，所以它写出来的风格不能指望读者研读或重读。它力求简洁高效，描述鸟的方式要足够具体准确，能让读者识别出来。

一本优秀的野外指南当然是反复斟酌和修改的结果，但它听起来像是理想的即兴发言，就好像身处野外时，身边一位才华横溢的同伴想要告诉你些什么。作者和读者之间是一种对等关系：虽然作者比读者更了解这个主题，但如果读者看到了作者看过的东西，他会和作者一样了解这个主题。指南的目的是把读者放到与作者对等的位置。

作者对读者并无所求。作者的目的纯粹是呈现真相。作者和读者均无任务在身。作者写作，读者阅读，他们不是为了完成某个外部任务 —— 解决问题、赚钱、赢官司、拿回退款、卖保险、修机器 —— 而是为了探讨一个主题 —— 上面这个例子探讨的是鸟 —— 并共同发现这个主题的真相。作者采取了一种无所不知的姿态，毕竟对一个在野外的人来说，最恼人的是读到一篇表达不清又自我辩解的文章。

《奥杜邦协会北美鸟类野外观鸟指南·美国东部地区》中的条目所列的每个观察在形式上接近古典风格，和我们发现任何事物一样。在古典风格中，典型场景是一个人与另一个人交谈，呈现彼此都能观察到的东西。观鸟指南与该场景并不完全一致，因为它是写作，不是说话，而且两个人不是实际的面对面；但尽管如此，已经相当接近古典模式了。野外指南最显著的特点是，从不会让读者关注文章本身。介绍凤头山雀的词语（没有那么温顺，也没有那么与人亲近），或描述灰伯劳的句子（与大多数鸣禽不同，伯劳鸟捕食小型鸟类和啮齿类动物，用喙捕捉到它们后，有时还把它们穿在荆棘或铁丝网上储存起来），都是绝佳的表达，但它拒绝承认这是呈现该主题的唯一方式。这篇文章的清晰与必然，与它描述鸟类的存在一样复杂精妙，不含糊不做作。要写凤头山雀或灰伯劳，只要仔细观察就够了，不需要额外的思考和努力。观看是写作的一部分。观察到位了，写作就没什么难的了。

「奥杜邦协会野外指南丛书」毫不犹豫地假定，读者对鸟自然是感兴趣的。呈现的每一个细节都同等重要。整篇文章要逐字逐句品读。长嘴啄木鸟（hairyopeeker）这一条指出，它可以消灭昆虫（如钻木甲虫，「用带倒钩的舌头把虫子从树洞中钩出来。和其他啄木鸟一样，它敲打枯木，既是求爱仪式的一部分，也是为了宣称自己的领地。」讲述者没有显露丝毫的羞怯或尴尬，无论描述长嘴啄木鸟是「一次敏锐而特殊的匆匆一瞥」，还是西美草地鹨（western meadowlark）和东美草地鹨（eastern meadowlark）「如此相似，直到 1844 年奥杜邦才发现两者的差异，因为这种疏忽导致给西美草地鹨起名为‘neglecta'。当作者说「好莱坞电影配乐中经常出现西美草地鹨的歌声，哪怕电影取景地不属于西美草地鹨的活动范围」，作者的立场只是呈现真相，没有故作精明也没有任何偏祖。作者用语言表达思想时没有一丁点局促不安，所以词句不会流露出任何忐忑或羞怯。又如下面这句对西美草地鹨叫声的描述：「咯咯的音符交杂一起，像长笛一样圆润洪亮，常用降调；和东美草地鹨一阵阵的简单哀鸣不一样。」讲述者从不言过其实，也不会言不尽意，而总是恰如其分。他们说话的口吻是它本该如此。作者不需要捍卫什么。

非古典场景

选段 4-2

「龙骑兵领带」

十六世纪后期，欧洲有种士兵进攻时骑马作战，防御时下马成为步兵，叫作「龙骑兵」（dragoon）。这种叫法源于他们的武器，一种称作「dragoon」的卡宾枪或短管滑膛枪。在十八世纪普鲁士大帝腓特烈二世的早期战争中，「龙骑兵」指的是中型骑兵。英国军队的轻骑兵在十八、十九世纪时，多数情况下被称为「轻型龙骑兵」。和骑兵一样，轻型龙骑兵这种说法和相应功能在二十世纪也消失了。

这款斜纹丝绸领带为我馆特有，领带上的龙骑兵形象，源自美国国家历史博物馆军事历史展览中一顶十七世纪锡制帽装饰品上的图案。

—— 1991 年美国国家历史博物馆礼品店小卡片上介绍龙骑兵领带的文字

当作者渴望或需要从读者那里得到什么时，实际场景不是古典场景。古典风格作者不会直接争取读者的认同，也从未公开征求读者的支持，或明面上从事任何层面的推销活动。他写作不是为了让读者相信什么，也不是为了引导读者做什么；他写作没有任何实际目的。他只是呈现一个有趣的真相。这种真相有可能自然导向某些判断或行动，但在这种情况下，真相本身就足以让读者做出这种判断或行动。

当专业领域或商业领域的作者想从读者那得到什么时，通常用实用风格写作。技术手册、商品推销、政治争论、本科生论文、计算机指令、社论专栏以及各种想引起我们注意并想左右我们选择的文本，通常会写成实用风格，至少是尝试用这种风格。

这是有原因的。当有人想从我们这得到什么时，我们不一定会愿意听，更别说听每一个细节。实用风格允许略读，并要尽可能节省读者的精力。如果作者知道，读者正在读上百份类似的文件，已经开始疲倦甚至厌烦了，并且开始略读某些部分，不管是看不了还是不想看，就是没办法逐一细读，这时候必然要用实用风格。

即使是与古典场景对应的实际场景，使用古典风格的效果也很显著。古典风格是一种通用的呈现型风格，任何东西都可以呈现。采用古典风格的典型场景，可以把读者带到更愉快、更高尚的场景中，弱化实际场景。这种场景转换，能立即达到作者的实际目的。在古典风格的典型场景中，某个人只是用一种简单日常的即兴方式呈现真相。在实际场景中，作者和读者之间可能存在潜在的利益冲突，或者读者因为某些原因可能不乐意主动投入自己全部注意力，又或者作者在尝试对读者施予压力，总之，作者和读者不能完全客观地参与到所呈现的真相中。如果古典风格的典型场景能隐藏这些实际场景，作者不用额外做什么就能达到他的目标，因为他设定的场景已经实现这些目标了。

所有修辞立场中最有说服力的是，写出来的好像不是为了说服而只是为了呈现真相；所有修辞立场中最吸引读者的是，写出来的好像读者当然对所呈现的事物感兴趣，好像这个问题不值一提。如果能做到的话，通常最好的修辞立场是，让说话听起来不带任何修辞目的。正确应用这种立场可以一开始就实现实际修辞目的：读者感兴趣或被说服，压根没想到是作者刻意引导使然。把这种修辞策略用到经常使用实用风格或演说风格的情境中，效果很显著。而且比起实用风格或演说风格的刻意，这种策略更令人愉悦。平等相待让读者感到被尊重，客观地谈论真正有趣的事物让读者感到放松。

用古典风格隐藏实际目的相当明智，由此更能深化它的主题、作者和读者之间的关系。读者要是埋头阅读一百篇实用风格的备忘录，可能更希望它们被写成古典风格，因为古典风格从不把阅读当作任何人必须完成的任务的一部分，而是把阅读当作读者感兴趣且无法抗拒的事情。

这段呈现史密尼森博物馆龙骑兵领带的话，示范了如何用古典风格推销商品，但它有一处明显的瑕疵，即透露了古典风格和实用广告风格的差别。「我馆特有」这个词没用好：第一，古典风格作者只为自已说话。他不承认自己作为某机构代言人。相反，他在跟别人平等地对话。第二，「特有」这个词，尽管从词义上指只有在史密尼森博物馆才能买到这条领带，但它属于销售用语，容易让人立即联想到销售员向顾客兜售商品的典型场景。

但是，如果将「我馆特有」这个词换成「这条」，这段文字就具有古典风格了。它假装在说话。它的目的是呈现有趣的真相。它采取的是无所不知的姿态。某人只是和你讲你所看之物的有趣之处。你会看到每个细节。作者与读者之间是一种对等关系。尽管写作技巧了得，它并没有把关注点引向文本本身。「和骑兵一样」这样简洁易记的短句，用插入语的形式恰如其分、轻描淡写地呈现历史情境，就像作者信手拈来一样。当然，读者有兴趣了解领带及其细节、图像和制作材料，以及相关历史。读者可能想要这条领带也是很自然的事情。作者实际上在诱导读者做某些事情，如买领带这种庸俗行为，但绝不能让这种意图显露出来。

「这条」和「我馆特有」都是语法学家所说的「限定词」。这个替换没有改变「短语语法」或「文本-语法」的层面的内容，但改变了风格，说明只是列出「短语语法」或「文本-语法」的特征，无法定义或从其他风格中区分出古典风格。因此，模仿「短语语法」或「文本语法」的某些范例无法让一位作者学会古典风格。这就是为什么本书不是一本语法指导手册。它讲述的是风格概念、风格要素及古典风格对风格要素的立场。思考过古典风格的读者会发现，可以从本博物篇展示的文本中看出来，在某些场合，古典风格对风格要素的立场可能会表现出相应的表面特征，但这些表面特征并不构成风格。

呈现

主题不限

选段 4-3

当地人称它为阿卡迪亚，但它有个更广为人知的名字，叫嘉郡，这个与世隔绝、阴冷潮湿的地区居住着法国难民和获得自由的奴隶的后代。

——《洛杉矶时报》，1992 年 8 月 28 日 

痔疮实际上是直肠静脉曲张。

—— 一家医疗诊所匿名小册子上的第一句话，1992 年

我们摘录这个选段是想说明呈现任何事物都能用到古典风格。因为古典风格是一种非常优秀的风格，而且在十七世纪法国的文体大师常用古典风格写贵族话题，因此古典风格被误认为只适用于写与贵族相关的主题。其实，恰恰相反，第一个选段是时事头条，报道安德鲁飓风在墨西哥湾沿岸的路易斯安那州登陆。作者以一种全知姿态，认为读者理所当然对这个主题感兴趣。每个细节都值得关注：「当地人称它为阿卡迪亚」。

第二个选段是一本佚名日常医疗小册子上开头的话。作者写出来就好像这个主题明显对读者很重要，好像他在谈论圣灵的奥秘或美味的葡萄酒无规律的演变历史一样。「实际上」这个词，预设了读者当然对这个主题感兴趣。

从主题到细节

选段 4-4

古希腊人希望为荷马诸神的丑闻辩解。

—— 迈克尔·默林，《寓言史诗》3

物理学素有将许多现象合成几个理论的历史。

—— 理查德·P. 费曼，《QED：光和物质的奇异性》4

自反原则被获得的方式是，把某个问题或主题分析成足够同质又独立的整体，用以解决问题或阐述主题。

—— 理查德·麦克科恩，《哲学与方法》5

视觉有一些基本模式。其中，最基本的一个模式是，我们被某种刺激物吸引，然后开始观察更细微的细节。眼睛的构造正是为了服务这种模式：我们的周边视觉不太敏锐，但可以让我们选定想关注的东西；然后我们转动头部，让刺激物进入视网膜的中央区，即中央凹，这是一个更敏感的接收器，适宜观察细微的东西。

这种感知模式，不仅是我们所有感官认识的基础，也是我们理解抽象概念的基础。我们认为概念观察也遵循这种结构：我们选定一个概念，投入注意力，然后观察它更细微的细节。因此我们常常说这样的话：「现在让我们把注意力转向债券市场」，或者「他如果到处看看，他会看到发生了什么」。

因为古典风格向读者呈现主题，所以毫不奇怪古典风格会偏好这种感知和观察的基本模式。古典风格作者常常将自己的任务视为，让读者选定一个特定的抽象主题，投入注意力，然后关注它更细微的细节。通常，一篇古典文章或一个古典句子的语法结构也会契合这种模式。一篇古典文章在正文前会有一个标题 —— 凤头山雀、灰伯劳、龙骑兵，这种意象图式可以帮我们快速理解文章：标题让我们选定一个事物并注意到它，正文会呈现细微之处。

选段 44 中的前面两句用的是这种基本的呈现型意象图式结构。在概念上，每段都希望呈现一个主题 —— 古希腊人或物理学 —— 然后更细致地观察这个主题。在语法上，每段先是指明主题，然后对该主题做具体陈述。

有意象图式并不意味着是古典风格。假设这几个句子写的是：「古希腊人希望获得荣耀」和「物理学素有试图解释现实的历史」。这两个句子都将读者引向一个主题，接着尝试选了一个细节。两者都是无所不知的姿态，没有拐弯抹角地分散读者的注意力。两者都是一个人与另一个人交谈的典型场景，并且两者都是模仿声音而非写作。诸如此类还有很多。但要达到古典文章的标准，它们仍有瑕疵，因为古典表达是用准确的词汇表达细微的概念差异。

古典呈现的成败在于是否体现细微的概念差异。迈克尔·默林和理查德·费曼的两个选段，看起来是仔细斟酌过这种差异的。从这两段话可以看出来，要做出如此细致的选择和概念区分，作者必须掌握丰富的知识。它们都没有引起读者关注作者本人的学识，也没表示出即使读者有作者一样的体验也无法看到这些真相，但两者确实表达了这种象：只有具备丰富的个人体验才能做出这些呈现，尽管只是呈现合理真相而非个人经验。

选段 4-4 的前两句尝试阐述一些极其复杂的事物的本质。每段都需要细致入微的观察。没有这种观察，它们与「在古代世界，每个人都相信神决定一切」或「性以某种方式让你感觉良好」这些句子没什么区别：表达的都是肤浅的知识，或者是没有根据的陈词滥调。

选段 4-4 的第三句出自理查德·麦克科恩，主题不明，尽管逐条比对传统的风格清单，但仍很难看出原因。惯用法手册通常不鼓励使用被动语态，但这个选段即使改成主动语态，也不好读。

麦克科恩是罗伯·波（Robert Pirsig）《禅与摩托车维修艺术》（Zen and the Art of Motorcycle）这本书中「主席」的榜样，像杰里米·边沁一样，他写文章是为了让人解谜而不是供人阅读。一些人认为这种写作特征造就了 —— 虽狭隘但深入人心的 —— 他那深奥的文风。当一位哲学家的作品很难读懂时，一些读者认为话题本身的困难导致了他的文学风格不易理解。他们理所当然地认为他的思想非一般人能懂，他的语言也非一般人能读懂。费曼认为，他可以让普通读者理解量子力学：相反，麦克科恩可能会把《巴斯克维尔的猎犬》（The Hound of the Baskervilles）写得像量子力学一样难懂。但是无论读者如何看待他的思想特点，阅读几页麦克科恩的文章确实常常让人觉得好像陷入了漩祸一样。读者之所以晕头转向，是因为麦克科恩是极少数不遵循人类常规感知模式的作家之一。这个选段看起来是在引导读者使用常规的感知模式和概念模式来理解 —— 指向一个清晰的主题，然后深入研究其他细节 —— 但读者尝试用这种方式理解时会发现，要呈现的主题看起来从未确定过。这句话好像在反复确认主题，而没有深入细节，犹如某种令人费解的循环论证。

别让叙事作者取代主题

选段 4-5

马奎曾经在圣母玛利亚无原罪受胎节的宴席上庄严地发誓，只要圣母玛利亚允许他发现这条大河，他就用「受胎」这名字为河命名，并以此来纪念圣母。他实现了他的诺言。那时候所有的探险家在探险旅行时都带着传教士，德·索托的身边就有二十四个传教士，拉萨尔身边也有几位传教士。虽然探险队时常缺少肉食，衣服也显然不足，而用于做弥撒的设施和必需品却一应俱全，他们永远准备好这些物品。在当年的编年史中有一条颇为奇妙的说法，即这些物品是「为了向未开化的野人阐明地狱情形的」。远在我孩提时代，与我同住在密西西比河西岸村子里的同代伙伴，都怀抱着一个永恒不变的远大志向。这个志向就是当一名轮船上的水手。我们也有其他各种各样的一时性的志向，所有那些志向不过是片刻的虚幻。比如，马戏团来到这里又走了之后，会留给我们一些火辣辣的思绪 —— 想去当个小丑；又如，黑人乐团第一次来到这里演奏时，也激起过我们的幻象 —— 想去过这种生活。不时有一种希望出现在脑海之中，那就是：如果我们活着，为人正派，上帝便允许我们去当海盗。然而所有这些远大志向都会一个个地轮流破灭，唯独「当一名水手」的志向会常驻心间。

—— 马克·吐温，《密西西比河上的生活》① 6

① 汉译文出自罗志野翻译版本，本书其他《密西西比河上的生活》选段均出自该翻译版本。—— 译者注

古典文章是观看主题的窗户。主题从不会被作者本人替代。当主题是凤头山雀、龙骑兵的领带、安德鲁飓风、物理学、古希腊人或任何不可能混淆为作者本人的主题时，很容易区分。如果主题是作者曾经参与其中的某个事件，两者的区分会微妙起来。这种区分在古典风格的叙事性新闻（literary journalism）中极为常见，作者常常报道他经历的场景：呈现自己的角色是呈现场景的一部分。李伯龄（A. J. Liebling）《在巴黎的餐桌上》（Betveen Meals）这本书写学习怎么吃时，他写了一名年轻的美国大学生逃课去各种法国餐厅品尝美食。吐温写《密西西比河上的生活》时，他写了一个在密西西比河长大的男孩幻想成为领航员，后来他真的成了密西西比河上的领航员。




男孩吐温和少年领航员吐温都是主题的一部分；他们没有被作者吐温替代。我们不是在阅读一本开头声称讲密西西比生活，到作者回忆美国南北战争前的青春岁月时，却发现自己陷入作者个人内心动荡的书。

当一位古典风格的作家呈现自己的经历时，所呈现的是既非私密也非纯个人的东西。吐温呈现的经历并不私密：如果你在那里，你会看到他看到的，而他的目的是将你放在刚好能看到的位置上。你现在无法参观密苏里州的汉尼拔镇纯属偶然。同样，这些经历不是纯个人的。你可以看出他呈现的童年野心的真相，也可以通过自己的经历或别人的讲述确认这个真相。

因此，作家吐温和拥有这些个人经历的吐温，从未取代文章的主题 —— 密西西比河上的生活。男孩吐温和蒸汽船领航员吐温是这个主题的一部分，也是这样被呈现出来的。

吐温是一个固执己见的人，他有些书的观点不够古典，带着某种利益倾向或好斗情绪，但《密西西比河上的生活》是一部古典风格作品，不关心利益，有断言但没有争辩。作者的姿态是：密西西比河上的生活新奇有趣，他刚好想着告诉你就即兴说了起来。他写得好像没有什么要论证的，只需讲述事实，读者只要在他那个位置立即就能看出来。讲述探险家和牧师的那段邪恶小史时，吐温把他自己的断言表达成纯粹的观察。吐温最好的一些作品把这种隐藏手法用得特别娴熟，就如下面一段话，吐温实际论证的观点是：派遣军队入侵的一方不可能对被入侵的那一方感同身受。吐温既不断定也不怀疑他的核心论点。他只是呈现出北方人和南方人在观点表达上的显著差异。

在北方，一般社会交际当中，你一个月会听到一次有关战争的谈话，有时候也会多到一个星期提到一次战争的事。但是作为特殊的题材，战争这个话题在很久之前就不走运了。之所以这样，其理由是很充足的。今天如果有六位先生在一起吃饭，通常他们当中有四个人，或者有五个人，根本就没有上过战场。所以谈论战争的可能性只是二比四或者一比五，今天晚上战争这个话题看来就无法进行了。不过谈论这一话题的机会还是有的，但是谈论的时长很短。如果在这行人中间再添上六位妇女，也就是说添了六位目睹极少战争可怕场面的人，她们就无法谈论很多年前的战争情况，你要是提到战争，要不了一会儿，她们对这个话题便感到厌烦。

在南方的情况完全不一样，那里你遇到的每一个男人都经历过战争，你遇到的每一个女人也都见到过战争。战争是他们最主要的谈话主题，一谈到战争，兴趣便来了，百谈不厌。而其他话题却是一谈便结束，是暂时的。一提到战争，原来沉闷的伙伴便兴高采烈起来，舌头一溜便谈开了，这时其他一切话题便显得毫无生气。在南方，战争就是其他地方的耶稣纪元，他们是以战争作为开始的日子的。一天到晚你都会听到什么事情是战争一开始发生的，在战争中发生的，在战前发生的，在战后发生的，或者是在战前、战后的两年、五年、十年发生的。这就说明，战争跟每一个经历过重大事件的人都联系得那么紧密，这就使得没有经历过的外地人对战争所带来的灾祸有了一个明确的看法，比他坐在炉边读描写战争的书要强得多。7

让抽象看得见

选段 4-6

瞻仰今桐生家后代子孙所收藏之辉胜像，南蛮胴搭配黑革连缀的铠甲袖，铠甲下连护腿甲；头盔两旁有宛如水牛角的巨大装饰，右手持朱红指挥扇，置于膝上的左手大张，拇指按着大刀刀鞘，足蹬毛靴，双脚盘于虎皮垫上。若除去甲胄，也许能一窥体格，可惜如此装扮仅能瞧见容貌。战国时代的英雄画像大多像这样全副武装。观看历史图鉴常出现的本多平八郎、神原康政等人之像，都非常类似，无不看起来威风凛凛，又让人觉得有点怒气冲天，仿佛旁人近身不得的紧绷模样。

—— 谷崎润一郎，《武州公秘话》，英文翻译：安东尼·钱伯斯 08

① 汉译文出自张蓉蓓翻译版本。—— 译者注

古典风格作者的优秀在于细致敏锐的眼光。从字面上来讲，这种眼光常常是视觉上的，如上面谷崎润一郎观察辉胜像左手的细节。古典风格的眼光是一种引申义，包括通过感官或通过推理观察到的任何事物。谷崎润一郎先是观察头盔、胸甲和指挥扇这些看得见的细节，接着观察了无法直接看到的细节：威风凛凛、怒气冲天、近身不得、不舒适的紧绷感；传统的英勇姿态；文化历史框架。我们不能像看一只手一样看到英雄主义、文化场合或冲天怒气，但是古典风格作者假定我们可以用同样的方式观察到。谷崎润一郎看到并呈现出来的真相是公开的：一旦指出来，任何没有视力障碍的人都能看到这只手及其异常粗大的样子。同理，一旦指出来，任何没有智力障碍的人都会看到文化框架、英雄主义、紧绷感和怒气。真相不言而喻，古典风格作者只需如实呈现，让读者自己观察和验证即可。

真相

真相终将胜利

选段 4-7

我们认为以下真理是不言而喻的：人人生而平等；人人都享有上帝赋予的某些不可转让的权利，其中包括生命权、自由权和追求幸福的权利。

—— 托马斯·杰斐逊，《独立宣言》

一个人只要推理能力极强，极会把自己的思想安排得明白易懂，总是最有办法使别人信服自己的论点的，哪怕他嘴里说的只是粗俗的布列塔尼土话，哪怕他从来也没有学过修辞学。

—— 勒内·笛卡儿，《谈谈方法》① 9

① 汉译文出自王太庆翻译版本，本书其他《谈谈方法》选段均出自该版本。—— 译者注

「真相是纯粹的、永恒的，不是偶然的。」杰斐逊的话有如一颗明星悬于天上。他的话确实是对特定场合的回应，但他的回答既可使用于该场合，也能独立于该场合。他表达的是永存不变的事物：造物主把它赋予我们。它是基本事实，而非某个过程的结果。它不是获得的。它不可转让，所以无法改变。

根据笛卡儿的说法，真相不仅是永恒的，而且是独立于任何场合的，任何人都有可能知道 —— 原则上没有例外，除非是天然的缺陷，生下来就有心智障碍。令人信服无须具备精英专属的特殊能力，比如读写能力、良好的教育、城市居民、富裕家庭等。杰斐逊也认同真相是民主的，所以他才会认为「这些真相不言而喻」，所有人都能看到。一个没有上过学，不会说法语，只会说布列塔尼语的农民可以比一位巴黎的修辞学教授更具有说服力，如果他的思考比修辞学教授的更有逻辑。

两个选段都表达了一种整体的乐观态度。真相终将胜利，大部分当即就胜利。这种乐观是「美国化」的一种态度，是典型的「美国古典风格」。

真相：看到就会相信

选段 4-8

呈现真相，就是让人相信它。

—— 布菜兹·帕斯卡，《沉思录》10

真相不可能说出来能让人理解，不能让人相信。

—— 威廉·布菜克，《天堂与地狱的婚烟》11

和杰斐逊和笛卡儿一样，帕斯卡认为：「人人都可以知道真相：看到就会认出来。」帕斯卡的这句话中，让什么人相信真相？答案是看到真相的任何人，凡是身心健全的人都会相信真相。如杰斐逊和笛卡儿说的那样，观察真相与社会地位、教育、财富或任何其他资格都无关。它不是谁的专属。在什么样的场合，真相可以呈现出来让人看到？在什么样的情境，真相可以呈现出来让人看到？答案是在任何场合、任何情境下真相都可以呈现出来让人看到：因为真相与对真相的观察不依情况而变。

真相一旦被看到，就会立即让人完全信服。诡计也可以被亲眼看到，但你不会相信。你可以看到一些你相信不可能存在的东西，比如沙漠里的海市蜃楼。许多事情即使看到，也仍然被怀疑是假的。但是，真相不是这样，看到它就知道它是真相。

呈现真相的过程就是说服的过程。真相自有足够的力量。从这点来看，真相很不人道：它完全自给自足；它克服了一切人类缺点；它不需要人类的任何帮助。要让它被看到，只需纯粹地呈现。正如杰斐逊所言，一且指出，真相不言而喻。

真相完美无缺。发现真相不会带来什么利益，因此它不偏不倚。它没有行骗动机。它无法虚伪地表现自己，因为它没有任何自我表现。自我表现只有人类才有。人并非完全可见，因为被包装着。这种包装总是受突发事件、一时利益和个人欲望的影响，因此不值得信赖。但真相没有包装。真相被包装后就不再是真相。

帕斯卡的话隐含着一个前提，适宜的文章或适宜的呈现是一扇窗户：透过这扇窗可以直达真相。呈现有可能出错，以至于真相无法展示出来，所以人们看不到真相。窗户可能翘曲、变脏或模糊，变成一种虚假的包装。这是呈现的失败，而不是真相的失败。真相从不缺乏力量或说服力。

真相总是能够经得起考验。它顶多被误解和误用。但没有什么对真相是致命的。真相是永恒的，任何试图玷污真相的行为注定失败。就如呈现的方式会被歪曲一样，观察的方式也可能被歪曲，但真相不可能被歪曲，甚至不会受这种歪曲的影响。它独立于人类的目的。尽管一个人可以拒绝观看真相或拒绝呈现真相，但不可能看不到被展示出来的真相，否则就是不通情理。

这需要训练，但任何人都可以呈现真相，而且真相通常会呈现出来。一旦呈现出来，它会发挥出其全部的效力。

布莱克的句子看起来和帕斯卡的句子很像。在风格上，威廉·布莱克的句子出人意料地有点复杂：真相不可能说出来能让人理解，不能让人相信。用平实风格表达这句话是「真相不可能说出来，也不可能让人相信」。

布莱克在平实风格的基础上做了进一步的提炼、限定和思考。他用简单的词句提炼出关键概念，让这种断言变得更加复杂巧妙，这是平实风格尽力规避的。这种言简意赅的概念提炼是典型的古典风格，所以布莱克的句子看起来很古典。

但布菜克不是古典风格。实际上布莱克的风格模棱两可。这个情况复杂且无法解决。经过考虑可以看出，布莱克的句子观点据摆不定，但由于作者和读者之间的交流通道不完整，所以读者甚至不能确定布莱克是否有意摇摆不定。表面上他呈现的是永恒可知的真相，不是偶然，也不限于特定场合，但如果我们仔细观察，他可能在表达完全不同的观点。他从未说真相有可能说出来，所以能被理解。这样的观点违背了古典风格的基础前提。这个基础前提在布莱克的句子中摇摆不定，依据一个可能实现也可能无法实现的前提。这个句子不是古典风格，不是因为它背离了古典风格的真相立场，而是因为它呈现的东西不是确定的。它在古典视角和非古典视角之间摇摆。这种形式的未决事物不可能是古典风格。

布莱克的句子就像一个内克尔立方体：它包含两种不同的图形，观察时我们一会儿看到这个图形，一会儿看到那个图形。它并非永恒。它不稳定。它不可能稳定下来。它看起来很古典，但这只是虚假的表象。

真相无须美化

选段 4-9

写作要自然、有力、精妙，就需要表现出真相。

—— 拉布吕耶尔，《品格论》2

事实是（国王）令人钦佩，并且肯定值得被历史学家载入史册，而不是被两位诗人歌颂。你和我一样清楚当我们谈到诗人时是指什么。无论怎样国王都不需要他们：不需要通过创造或虚构，将他推至别人之上；只需要一种纯粹的风格，干净而直接…...

—— 塞维涅夫人，《致堂兄布西 - 拉鲁廷的信》，1678 年 3 月 18 日 [13]

这两段互为补充的话引自法国古典风格的两位奠基人，表达了古典风格对待真相的典型立场，按照这种传统，这种立场比任何创造都更具有说服力，而且是人类才智未受蒙蔽时自然追求的目标。创造需要技巧。而真相自带说服力，无须复杂的修辞技巧或诗歌技巧。它只需要清晰地呈现。人类的才智可以自然地识别真相。技巧只会误导一这正是它的目的。这种误导会降低人类对真相的天然敏感度，从而削弱人类观察真相的天然能力。

因此，真相自然、有力、精妙。呈现真相的语言最好不要引起对自身的关注。当我们谈论某人的个人风格或文章风格时，我们通常指那些显眼的特征。当拉布吕耶尔谈论「自然地写作」时，他思考的是一种毫无特色的风格，就像「自然」不具有特色一样。从这个意义上，现代书在版式上比古抄本更自然，因为书打开后相互对称，正符合人体的对称结构。十二开的书最初是为了适合手拿而设计的，而现代书籍的版式是一种文本排布风格 —— 自然、有力、精妙，只有书目学家、图书装订员或档案管理员才可能意识到这是一种专为文本呈现而设计的版式。

古典风格就像一本书的版式，读者看得到，但它并不显眼。它适合呈现真相，就像一本书适合拿在手上。如果我们可以想象一台机器或一个外星人对人类身体一无所知，却要试图为人类读者设计一种文章呈现版式，我们就大概能理解为什么拉布吕耶尔认为作者没见到真相时应尽量自然、有力和精妙了。对人类读者而言，机械的设计或外星人的设计就不是自然、有力和精妙了，这好比让长着牡蛎身子的智慧生物拿一本十二开的图书一样。

塞维涅夫人是法国古典风格大家之一，接受过良好的文学教育。除法文外，她还懂拉丁文和意大利文，熟知许多写作风格。她喜欢塔索（Tasso）和阿里奥斯托（Ariosto）的寓言史诗，以及帕斯卡、拉罗什福科、莱兹和她的密友拉法耶特夫人的古典散文。但她认为诗歌无法表现一位名副其实的国王真正的品德，因为诗歌「美化」了真相。在十七世纪的法语用法中，pose（诗歌）的意思是「创造的故事」，而不是「真实的故事」，它最大的特点是虚假的修饰和出色的创造。她遗憾没有人记录路易十四的胜利，只有两位担任皇家史学家的诗人于 1678 年记录了路易十四当年攻下根特城，尽管一位是拉辛，另一位是博伊洛。塞维涅夫人并非反对使用思想和语言修辞形式 —— 隐喻、转喻、明喻、叙事、象征等不同的简化和具化形式 —— 这些通常是思想和语言必不可少的形式，在呈现古典风格真相时发挥着重要作用。她只是不赞成把它们当作点缀、装饰和技巧以「美化」真相。对塞维涅夫人来说，诗歌的修饰手法适合用来谈论史诗和传奇故事中的罗兰（Roland）或其他英雄人物，但当代现实只需要一种纯粹、干净、直白的风格。任何修饰只会分散人们观察真相的注意力，真相不需要帮助，只需要一个不受阻隔的视野。

让读者置身现场

首支盟军登陆法国的第三天，我在一艘大型步兵登陆艇（LCIL）的军官室里。登陆舰在法国巡洋舰蒙卡尔姆号的背风处飘荡着，邻近诺曼底海岸。登陆艇名号中的「大型」一词仅是相对而言。我所在的那间军官室长宽各七英尺，里面有两张双层床，一张四人桌。它可以容纳四名军官，但由于他们中总有一个人必须外出巡逻，军官室的四人桌可以留出一个空位给客人用，所以我刚好有位子坐。蒙卡尔姆号正在发射炮弹，每次发射都会使我们的船舰震动。发射目标是距离海岸线数英里的一个德军据点。房间里的收音机传来英国广播公司播音员张弛有度的声音：「本系列节目接下来报道的是前线的掩护炮火。」法国船再次发射炮弹，淹没了收音机的声音。我想播报的声音出自同一位播音员一我不确定，因为所有的英国广播公司的播音员的声音听起来都差不多一过了一会儿播音员又继续报道：「我们现在可以说本次登陆一举成功，令人喜出望外。空军和海军的大炮摧毁了沿海防御工事，陆军占领了它们。」美国海岸警卫队后备队的亨利·里格中尉，我们登陆艇的船长，看着他的工程官：朗（Log），两人开始笑起来。船上的通讯官员卡瓦诺说：「现在你对此有何看法？」我轻呼一声「上帝」。在登陆艇上，诺曼底登陆日在我们看来似乎不是那样。没有哪个伦敦广播室能给一个小伙子提供客观视角。

—— 李伯龄，《渡海战役》14

选段 4-10(1) 记录了 1944 年 6 月 6 日，李伯龄亲历的盟军入侵诺曼底事件，当时，他在一艘步兵登陆艇上。很容易看出这是古典风格。它的模式是对话，它的场合是非正式的，它的语气轻松、自信、没有防范，它采取的姿态是呈现而非论证的。它实际上有很多肯定的断言，有登陆日的真实情况、机构报道的性质，还有同质化播音员不可靠的广播，只遵照他们机构的纲领完全不符现场实况。但是，这些断言假装成呈现，好像任何人只要在这艘小船舰上都能看见的呈现。

文段还提到了一些读者想不到的意外信息：步兵登陆艇「大」到什么程度，船员数量和李伯龄在船上的容身方式。但没有无端展示与事件无关的晦涩军事知识。没有什么只有观察者自己看得到；没有什么必须依赖作者个人对证据的解释；一切都取决于读者能否处于作者所在的位置。

这件轶事是一位记者对新闻报道的对比反思，一方是没有根据的描述，一方是李伯龄的亲身经历。正如现场大炮的轰鸣淹没了收音机录制的大炮现场的声音，李伯龄和登陆艇军官在现场的经历淹没了伦敦广播公司播报的诺曼底入侵的新闻。这件铁事的说服力取决于作者身处的位置，所有细节都调集起来，让读者能够处于跟作者同样的位置，这样他可以自己看到作者讲述的事情。

和对话一样，这些句子彼此相继的顺序看起来很自然也非此不可，但这是一种非常高效的叙述。想一想，它可以说是完美的迷你结构。整个叙述是对李伯龄的新闻报道视角的形象化论证，作为对比抨击了英国广播公司的播报视角。这种形象化论证在它的内部还有一个迷你版一被现场实况吞没的英国广播公司录制的广播。这个选段描述的整体画面与大炮轰鸣的局部画面相互映衬，就像一个是宏观视角，一个是微观视角。两种画面都很有冲击力，读者自然能从如此形象的叙述中得出显而易见的结论。但整个选段听起来是即兴对话。作者在无形之中完成了所有工作，文章并没有引起读者关注文本本身或作者的思考过程。

古典风格的这种使用方式并不局限于现场报道。我们在「读者可以胜任」这部分讲到的多德的选段，也用了这种方式。它包含大量事实和学术体系，但它把它们呈现为偶然的信息，只要传达得足够清晰，那么读者会像多德一样得出必然结论。多德的文章和李伯龄的一样听起来像对话，自信且没有防范。文章能表现出这种自信，主要是因为作者引用事实和例证的方式十分清晰：各种事实及彼此的关联没有含混不清。各个部分之间的衔接非常连贯：作者完全知道他想要呈现的关系。

让读者自行判断

选段 4-10(2)

虽然我依据埃利奥特的书信和著作，记录了他经历的十六世纪三十年代至四十年代间的圣经复兴潮，但他身处的背景显然深受文化和历史潮流的冲击，这些潮流远远不限于教义、宗教习俗和区分新教和天主教的基督教主权，尽管这些问题已经加剧。埃利奥特自己也认识到，他的文学事业所面临的挑战，是涉及投身国王和克伦威尔的改革措施或者「圣经」的「品位」的问题。埃利奥特在追求成为一名世俗作家并避开宗教问题的过程中成功采取了大众化和世俗化措施，我认为这可以理解为跟随而非对抗更大意识形态运动势头的证据一首先，因为大众化和世俗化对于埃利奥特而言是真正的选择；其次，因为他有能力让它们发挥效用。以我们今日所知，即使伊丽莎白·爱森斯坦关于印刷机作为文化变革动因的研究对此有所促进，大部分时候我们不得不从征兆性和预测性视角处理系列迸发式发展一其中印刷术、人本主义以及宗教改革在社会和经济发展中占据突出地位 —— 这引领了图书的现代时代。

—— 贾娜尔·米勒，《母语和单词：1380-1580 年间英语散文风格的演变》15

贾娜尔·米勒这段写托马斯·埃利奥特爵士的话出自她的一本书，这本书讲的是中世纪晚期和文艺复兴时期英语散文的风格。这段话不是古典风格，主要不是因为一些局部的问题 —— 比如次要问题使文章结构含混不清 —— 而是因为它对场景、角色和主题的观念。它罗列了证据，但表现出一种断定和防范的态度，而没有做到不偏不倚。作者渴求认同又防范反对和攻击，好像场景和角色是对抗而非对话。如果作者把他要说的话说得越来越模糊，那是要服务于一个战略目的：最后不会得出一个清晰的说法，以防读者有所反应。这种风格最适合主张「胜利就是一切」的司法场景和角色；但它通常违背学术责任。米勒描述的混乱场景有一种明显的紧张感，导致形式上相互冲突，学术证据本身含糊，彼此的关联牵强，有时根本没关联：「以我们今日所知一即使伊丽莎白·爱森斯坦关于印刷机作为文化变革动因的研究对此有所促进…」随机提到一些毫不相关的学术问题，看似博学，但缺乏学术论证。

李伯龄写的是你可以看到可以听到的东西，多德写的是文本编辑和历史解读这些最抽象的东西，两位作家都写得很清晰，好像他们呈现的主题独立于作者和文章而存在。而米勒写的主题好像依附于她本人而存在，这包括埃利奥特经历的「十六世纪三十年代至四十年代间的圣经复兴潮」，「他身处的背景」，「冲击」该背景的「文化历史潮流」的性质。「他身处的背景显然深受文化和历史潮流的冲击，这些潮流远远不限于教义、宗教习俗和区分新教和天主教的基督教主权，尽管这些问题已经加剧」。这段话的「显然」一词显得不可信的原因可能就在这里。真的很显然吗？对谁而言？对任何读过埃利奥特的「书信和著作」的人来说很显然吗？对埃利奥特自己很显然吗？明显不是。因为作者似乎不同意埃利奥特的说法。她说，他所做的一切应该以某种方式解释，即「跟随而非对抗更大意识形态运动势头的证据」。它应该这样被解释，她不断重复道，因为那正是他做的事情。她所提供的「证据」，依附于她的「视角」而「呈现」，作者提供的证据赋予这个特定视角说服力，但描述它的方式无法使读者站在她的视角看问题。只有基于那个视角才能得出结论，而且如此模糊，让人无从质疑。

虽然这段写埃利奥特的话表面上呈现了证据，但这些证据完全依附于作者的倾向。这种风格的作者可通过巧妙的处理，避免被质疑这类证据是否可靠，但这种情况下，要在本身既无形又不确定的抽象事物之间建立准确的联系，会有一种明显的紧张感，所以整个段落自然会透露出一种焦虑，甚至作者自己都不清楚她要讲的主题。她必须自我确认，她讲的都是真的，都很重要，她的理解合情合理且意义重大，读者会感兴趣。她的焦虑会传达给读者也不足为怪。

这类问题不常出现在数学领域，尽管数学主题一般都是抽象事物间的确切关系。这些事物虽然抽象，但它们与步兵登陆艇一样明显，而且这种关系的论据很明确，每个人都可以知道，不像「更大意识形态运动的势头」这种不明所以的方向。这种意识形态运动的边界，不像等腰三角形的边界一或步兵登陆艇军官室的大小一那样清晰可辨。这段对世俗作家托马斯·埃利奥特爵士的生涯的描述传达的明显紧张感，源于思想上的紧张：抽象事物本身不确定，却要为之构建关系并形成概念，还要呈现得跟平方根或大型步兵登陆艇军官的编制人数一样准确和可验证。而多德已经充分且准确地思考了他希望呈现的关系和抽象事物，所以写出来就像李伯龄写一艘船在另一艘船的背风处飘荡一样。古典风格非常适合呈现抽象事物，但古典风格作者要在仔细思考抽象事物的特征和边界后，才能自信地展现它们，不需要防范、歪曲或模糊，这些只会削弱读者自行判断作者的结论的能力。







思想和语言

晦涩主题清晰表达

选段 4-11

文艺复兴时期，在战争中使用火炮是重要的首创，但直到一段时间后才完全发挥出它的效果。查理八世正是靠它攻下米兰、佛罗伦萨、罗马和那不勒斯。按照阿里奥斯托的叫法，这个「恶魔的发明」（在他之后拉伯雷也对此进行过抨击），直接结束了传统的战争模式，也结束了身着盔甲的骑士意气风发的战斗。最终，这让为战争而生的贵族阶级毫无价值一直到在意大利及其他地区经历了 40 年的艰苦战争，被战争再次教育之后，贵族们才找到用武之地。大炮的使用范围扩大后，城镇的内外防御工事也开始彻底改革，该领域最出色的专家弗朗切斯科·迪·乔其奥和朱利亚诺·达·桑加洛，发明了一套螺纹套绳和较接式堡垒组合系统，彻底改变了城墙的朝向乃至整个设防城市的格局。最了不起的规划是那些米开朗琪罗为保卫佛罗伦萨（1529-1530 年）所做的规划，凯萨·波吉耳还以工程师的身份请过列奥纳多·达·芬奇。战争艺术的演变多大程度上影响了文艺复兴还有待充分评估。

—— 安德烈·夏斯岱尔，《1420-1520 年间的文艺复兴神话》16

这段话讲的是十六世纪在战争中引入火炮及由此带来的影响，除了社会影响，还有对「传统战争模式」等高度抽象事物的影响以及对城墙和防御工事等有形事物的影响一这些影响可能被别人写成「受系列军事发展冲击的文化和社会潮流方向」 —— 但选段只有开头的简短观点和结尾的一点补充。中间部分都是对开头观点的展开说明，同时援引了事件和例证，为最后的结论作铺垫。虽然这段仅两百词的话谈到了八位人物、四座城市，还提及具体的防御工事、新防御工事计划和在两个地方（一处有明确地点，另一处没有）持续四十年的战争，除了引用的戏称和随后括号中的题外话，提及的每个元素都在合适的位置上。没有哪一个让人感觉突兀或者随意。这种博学看起来并非毫无根据，也没有紧张感；没有模糊段落的组织结构，也没有阻碍行文的自然流动。主题复杂晦涩不代表呈现必须复杂晦涩。

选段 4-12

论句子说，加朗的版本是所有版本里最差、最荒谬、最愚蠢的一种，不过却是阅读量最大的一种。谁与它比较接近，谁就了解它这种幸运和意外。加朗那现在看来很浅薄的东方学曾经使众多吸鼻烟的人目瞪口呆，并且使他们造成了一场五幕悲剧。十二本精制的卷帙在一九O七年至一九一七年之间出现，十二卷书被无数人阅读，并被翻译成好几种语言，其中包括印度斯坦语和阿拉伯语。我们这些二十世纪不合时宜的单纯读者在书里闻到了十八世纪的甜蜜味道，而不是早在两百年前就为东方确定了其苹新和光荣的矜持芳香。对于这种脱节，任何人都没有责任，特别是加朗更没有责任。

—— 豪尔赫·路易斯·博尔赫斯，《「一千零一夜」的译者》① 17

① 汉译文出自《永恒史》刘京胜和屠孟超合译版本。—— 译者注

一千零一夜的故事也许不可言传。这些故事的文化起源 —— 印度文化、波斯文化及阿拉伯文化 —— 可能无法追溯。原作的手稿传统是一场噩梦，相比之下，传说中马洛的《浮士德博士》文本问题显得微不足道。这部作品的构成部分 —— 哪些故事属于它，或者至少哪些故事属于它的哪一个版本，以及故事出现的先后顺序 —— 基本上无法确定。它在十八世纪传遍整个欧洲时，出现了一系列著名译本，这些译本的历史往好说是复杂而微妙的，往坏说是无从知晓的。

任何一位作者，如果因为怀疑自己的写作能力导致风格受影响，面对这些知识障碍时就很难写下去。作者自身的文化处境和个人处境也可能导致其他障碍。豪尔赫·路易斯·博尔赫斯是二十世纪拉丁美洲优秀的古典风格作家，是图书管理员，是著名的博学之士，是男性。相此之下，「一千零一夜」发源的传统，不属于精英，不属于特权人士，不属于博学之士，不属于二十世纪，不属于白种人，不属于欧洲或拉丁美洲地区，也不属于男性：它的传播，也许还有故事的创作，很大程度上掌握在女性手中。它们在它们自己的时代已是公认的颠覆性故事，无论在我们这个年代，还是在它们自己的年代，都属主动背离政治正确：它们抨击当时的主流观念把意识形态工程当作对复杂的人类事务的有效回应。十八、十九世纪的英国人和法国人把这些故事传到了欧洲。

尽管博尔赫斯要面对这重重困难，而且在文化背景和个人经历上与这些故事的起源及它们的译者相差甚远，仍然写出了古典风格的姿态。他呈现的是普遍被知道的真相。原则上，任何人都可以验证这些真相，不管他是什么文化身份。他认为他的主题独立于作者存在，呈现上也是如此。他把它呈现给有能力的读者，从不会让文本本身成为写作主题。作者和读者之间是一种对等关系：就像多德在考虑《约翰福音》的文本历史时一样，博尔赫斯认为，原则上任何人都可以了解他了解过的，继而看到他所看到的。虽然博尔赫斯讲的是高度抽象的概念一东方学、版本质量、文本阅读量、幸运、十八世纪的味道、革新与光荣、责任和极其复杂的文化模式 —— 但他认为它们清晰准确。它们就像切割的水晶一样轮廓分明、清晰可见。没有哪个概念依附于作者本人而存在。

任何东西都能用古典风格呈现，包括作者和读者的文化历史处境，只要这些是主题的一部分。博尔赫斯把呈现作为二十世纪读者的我们的处境当作呈现这些翻译及其历史真相的一部分。但这些问题不会取代选定的主题，也不会干预主题的呈现。虽然古典风格作者的写作主题可能因为文化、历史和个人处境的阻碍无法或者很难写下去，他实际写的时候绝不会表现出任何表达上的困难。他会用简单明了、通俗易懂、确凿无疑的语言去呈现文章不可能写得简单明了、通俗易懂、确凿无疑这个真相。他会以一种读者会像他一样认识真相的姿态来表达读者不可能像他一样认识任何事物这个真相。

抽象主题准确表达

选段 4-13

图赖讷地区是法国的中心地带。和其他任何一个地区一样，正是在这里，发展了现代法国精妙、利落而细致的语言，恰恰也是在这里，发展了现代法国精妙、精细、专业的烹饪。

—— 威弗利·鲁特，《法国美食》18

人发现的可能是无意寻求的东西一事实上，每个鉴赏家都能切身体会到，人发现的东西几乎都不是他所寻求的。如果你去寻找草莓，你知道草莓长什么样子一但你去寻找事物之间的联系时，你不知道是什么样的联系。这种始终存在的危险恰恰在于，寻找某个东西的欲望和意愿会在寻求者心中预先投射一种关联种不存在的关联。

—— 马克斯·J. 弗里德伦德尔，《早期尼德兰绘画》19

绘画与文学之间不存在完美的结构对应，事实上这并不妨碍、更不能严格限制人们比较不同的艺术。相反，它鼓励人们寻找绘画者与写作者建立的一组不断变化的关系，他们可以自由强调各自艺术不同的结构元素，从而找到二者的对应关系。因此，艺术之间的相通不在于艺术本身固有的结枸：而在于探索这两种结构如何彼此契合。这种契合属于符号现象整体中必不可少的同形特征和同义特征（homonymity and synonymity）的一部分，这些特征使得符号系统和它们的文本彼此接近又相互背离。

—— 温迪·史坦纳，《修辞的颜色：现代文学与绘画关系存在的问题》20

鲁特和弗里德伦德尔的这两个选段是古典风格；史坦纳的选段不是。这种差异与他们论述的主题的性质无关，但与这些主题构思的方式有关。鲁特和弗里德伦德尔以一种清晰准确的方式论述他们的主题，使它们看起来完全独立于作者。而史坦纳论述主题的方式，好像主题因她而存在，因为她才能表达出来。

鲁特写的是食物与语言，而弗里德伦德尔写的是事物之间的关系：食物可以通过感官体验，而事物之间的关系可以通过抽象思维体验，二者都能用语言匹配，说明古典风格与主题的性质无关。鲁特谈的是有悖常理的事情，而弗里德伦德尔说的是我们都可以证实的事情，说明古典风格与其所谈内容的真假无关。

鲁特的句子是一种轻松自信的古典风格对话。即使错了，也丝毫没有削弱古典风格的立场。所谓图赖讷地区说的是原始的「纯正」法语，这种谬传经久不衰但一直面临各种矛盾 —— 图尔市的商店招牌上写着「Le Fast-Foud」（快餐）—— 任何声称现代法国美食起源于图赖讷的说法都会激怒一些地区的人，大概从桑斯算起直到里昂最南边。美食的特点与语言的特点存在某种关系 —— 当然，鲁特此处说的语言特点是某种风格的特点，而不是某种语言的特点 —— 这种说法必定无法让人信服。虽然许多大厨做的菜精妙、利落而细致，但他们说话的风格跟帕斯卡和塞维涅夫人相距甚远。其实鲁特并没有严肃地声明美食和语言之间存在必然联系。他虽未明言但断定美食 —— 跟文学风格一样 —— 是一种文化的重要标志。

语言和美食，即使仅限定在当代法国的语言和美食，仍是一个很大而且不确定的话题，但这里把它放入一个根深蒂固的本体论隐喻之中，看作与弗里德伦德尔笔下描绘的草莓差不多一样的「事物」。弗里德伦德尔是柏林凯撒·弗里德里希博物馆的第三任馆长，喜欢先用基础证据引入 —— 实际的绘画 —— 然后将抽象的东西归入这个模式中，将它们当作「事物」，呈现得如此清晰准确，让人几乎忘记它们是抽象事物。他以一贯辛辣的口吻指出，理论家如果不能清楚仔细地区别抽象事物本身和他讲述它们的方式，教出来的学生会和他们的老师一样，始终只能看到他们想看的东西；而像他那样的鉴赏家讲述抽象事物从概念上独立于他们的讲述方式，虽预想的是某个特定时间特定地方的画，但实际遇到的常常是意料之外的画。

史坦纳的写作是那种越写到后面越让人疑惑的类型。她的段落越写到后面，越偏向推测，也越不可能找出查验弗里德伦德尔所说的那种共同证据来验证特定的文本和绘画。而古典风格作者，无论他的主题多么抽象，都会非常明确地呈现出来，完全独立于作者，以至于我们所有人都会把它当作「事物」，也就是说，我们任何一个人都可以看到它的证据，只要我们处在合适的位置。相反，史坦纳的主题飘忽不定，依赖她本人存在，缺乏她与她的读者都能看到的对等证据，这些特征在她的文章中被认为是作者才识过人，而非作者无法胜任。最后呈现的这组包含文学和绘画的「结构」的抽象关系 ——「符号系统和它们的文本」和「符号现象整体中必不可少的同形特征和同义特征」—— 完全脱离了古典风格，暗示史坦纳的才能至少有某些神谕成分。鲁特的文章容易被攻击，正是因为他呈现的事物准确，且容易被我们自己验证，任何有幸同时学过法语和法国菜的人都可以质疑他。史坦纳把她的推测包裹在带行话色彩的修辞外衣中，暗示她知道别人不知道的事情，因此避免了像鲁特那样暴露自己的弱点，但是冒着自称有超自然的视野和洞察力的风险。她暗示她传达的是一般人看不到的奥秘，所谓的奥秘不过是绘画和文学虽不是各个方面相似但也能相互比较，大体了解主题后也不难得出结论：绘画和文学有相似也有不同。

[I]l est impossible qu'avec tant de vérité, je ne vous persuade mon innocence.

[It is impossible that with such truth I should fail to persuade you of my innocence.]

Elle lui parla avec tant d'assurance, et la vérité se persuade si aisément lors même qu'elle n'est pas vraisemblable, que M. de Clèves fut presque convaincu de son innocence.

[She spoke to him with such assurance, and truth so easily persuades even where it is improbable, that Monsieur de Clèves was nearly convinced of her innocence.]

— Madame de Lafayette, La princesse de Clèves

Both of the selections from La princesse de Clèves come from a scene in which the princess is attempting to persuade her husband on his deathbed that she has not been unfaithful to him. Although she is not disinterested, the scene remains classic because the princess — an exceptional character with a disciplined and religious devotion to truth — is governed by a respect for truth and not by her interests. We include these passages because they illustrate the classic conception of truth and because they explicitly connect that conception of truth to persuasion.

The conviction that truth persuades easily even when it contradicts appearances almost certainly belongs to Madame de Lafayette herself, not just to the narrator of her most famous novel. It is not a view idly held by a naïve person. Madame de Lafayette was an intimate of Henrietta of England, Louis XIV's sister-in-law, and enjoyed exceptional access to the king. Although the details remain obscure, she was actively involved in political questions — exceptionally so for a woman. She lobbied the French court on behalf of the dowager duchess of Savoy and, through her, kept the French informed of Duke Amadeus's secret policy decisions. After the death of Henrietta in 1670, she retired from court citing ill health, but powerful members of the court continued to visit her in Paris for years afterward. She dined at the king's table in 1672 to celebrate the treaty of Versailles, and retained a strong influence with his minister Louvois. She had seen dozens of reputations made and destroyed by intrigue and had an extraordinary sense of how powerful an apparently disinterested presentation could be. She had a reputation for respecting truth and for despising people who, from weakness, tried to evade unpleasant truths.

The kind of persuasion that interested her most was the persuasion of private conversation. It happens, as in the passages cited here from her novel, that prejudice, interest, or passion may prevent truth from being accepted. But in her conception, as in the princess's, truth is naturally persuasive, so much so that even against appearances, it will carry conviction with any unbiased listener. It was this principle upon which she built a career that any modern political lawyer or lobbyist could envy.

We would naturally suspect the scene of being unclassic, because the princess is clearly interested, but she takes the classic pose that the highest and governing motive is truth, whatever immediate pressures she may feel. As she says,「J'avoue que les passions peuvent me conduire; mais elles ne sauraient m'aveugler.」‘i admit that passions can lead me, but they do not have the power to blind me.' We cannot control our interests — we lack the power always to be in a situation of disinterest — but those interests do not have to govern our actions, even if it takes an extraordinary discipline to discount them. Ordinarily, we do not trust someone who claims to be acting apart from his interests. It is for this reason that Madame de Lafayette has taken such pains to establish the exceptional fidelity to discipline in the princess as a character. Once the character has been established both by summary and by event, it is possible to believe that despite the pressures of interest, her actions are governed by the classic motive of truth. This motive, despite the temptations of self-interest, can govern the actions of anyone willing to submit to exceptional discipline. When a reader is persuaded that someone who could be affected by self-interest is in fact acting on truth, the classic concept that truth, no matter how unlikely, carries its own persuasive force can have an overwhelming effect.

Persuasion in the classic conception is the mere establishment of a classic scene in which truth definitively supersedes all actual or possible motives of interest. A speaker in a situation of interest who can establish this scene through whatever means has overcome the countervailing presumption that people are always governed by interest.

In general, it may be true that people are governed by interest, but it does not follow that everyone in all cases is governed by interest. The classic writer governed by truth belongs then to an aristocracy — an aristocracy open to anyone willing to submit to the discipline of classic style.

Hardy was something of a Turing of an earlier generation; he was another ordinary English homosexual atheist, who just happened to be one of the best mathematicians in the world.

— Andrew Hodges, Alan Turing: The Enigma

The study of history would be unnecessary for political education if the lessons to be drawn from great historic events could be summed up in a few trenchant sentences. We would then need no more than these final sentences. But political prudence does not consist in recipes which can be conveyed: it is a virtue which has to be acquired the hard way. The greatest possible economy of effort is achieved if a very competent guide takes you through the important experiences of others. He tells you just enough and not too much: why this step was taken and how it turned out to be disastrous. It is for you to think out why it turned out to be disastrous and how it might have been avoided: it is only by such personal speculation that one gains political education; in that realm, as in all others, one only learns by thinking for oneself.

— Bertrand de Jouvenel,「Introduction」to the Thomas Hobbes translation of Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War

There is an unargued assertion within Hodges's sentence, although one that is not controversial: in his lifetime G. H. Hardy was one of the best mathematicians in the world. There is also a tacit claim here that is a little more pointed: great mathematicians may be quite ordinary in other respects. Finally there is a disguised assertion that neither homosexuality nor atheism is an abnormality, either in such special populations as great mathematicians or in the population at large.

Both Hardy, Sadleirian Professor of Pure Mathematics at Cambridge, who died at seventy — a year after a botched suicide attempt — in 1947, and Alan Turing, convicted sex criminal sentenced to a hormonal「cure,」who committed suicide at forty-two in 1954, lived in a time and place that regarded both homosexuality and atheism as shocking abnormalities, neither of which ordinarily was associated with any form of eminence.

Hodges, who is both a mathematician and an active critic of the medical model of homosexuality, gives a devastating selection of examples illustrating British concepts of homosexuality in Turing's lifetime and the effects they had on the lives of homosexuals. His book certainly encourages some ways of thinking about the subject and discourages others, but it does so by using resources of classic style. The power of the book derives not mainly from overt argument, but from the invisible argument of presentation.

This sort of invisible argument attempts neither to show the inadequacies of other opinions nor to offer explicit support for its own. It depends almost exclusively on showing the reader where to look. Hodges, in this passage, seeks to place his readers in a certain perspective; he asks them to line up「homosexual atheist」with「great mathematician.」There are people who might be so horrified by「homosexual atheist」that the last thing they would think to associate with such a description is「great mathematician.」But Hodges neither pontificates nor condescends. He speaks as if, of course, his reader knows, as well as he does, that an atheist homosexual can be an ordinary Englishman as well as a great mathematician.

At first the passage from Bertrand de Jouvenel may seem to be similar to the passage from Hodges. Jouvenel, like Hodges, asserts rather than engaging in grinding step-by-step argument, but the assertions are not just presented as truths that the reader will recognize as a matter of course. Jouvenel's writing is not tortured, but it does not have the ring of spontaneous speech, either. His assertions are made as if they were the beginning of an argument, even though no argument follows. The passage departs from the model scene and cast of classic style. The scene is not a conversation between equals; it is the scene of professor to sophomore. The writer prides himself on having come through difficulties to the wisdom he has earned and asks his readers to accept what he says because he knows more than they do, not because they can verify what he says by sharing his perspective. What he says is plausible and well expressed, but it is really a form of pontificating. The style is not classic, although the sentences are fine, and lead to a nice, if unearned, generalization.

The truth is rarely pure, and never simple.

— Oscar Wilde, The Importance of Being Earnest

Understanding a people's culture exposes their normalness without reducing their particularity.

— Clifford Geertz,「Thick Description」in The Interpretation of Cultures

Pour s'établir dans le monde, on fait tout ce que l'on peut pour y paraître établi.

[To establish oneself in the world, one does everything one can to appear to be established there.]

— François VI, duc de La Rochefoucauld, Maximes

[N]othing is more certain, than that much of the force as well as grace of arguments or instructions, depends on their conciseness.

— Alexander Pope,「Design」for An Essay on Man

There is nothing immediate or「natural」in contrast to what is mediate or sophisticated; there are only degrees of sophistication.

— Michael Oakeshott, Experience and Its Modes

The chronologically earliest of the five brief texts in this exhibit was written in the seventeenth century, the latest in the twentieth. Written in different cultures, for different purposes, even in different languages, they appear in quite different sorts of works, yet they share a family resemblance. Each is built around a fine but「simple」and — once formulated — inevitable distinction.

They all take the stand of noticing, as if casually, something that the reader too can notice, once his attention is properly directed. The reader has the pleasure of being able to「verify」what each writer claims, although in each case there is a refinement of commonplace observation that amounts to novelty.

Wilde suffuses his most famous play, The Importance of Being Earnest, with the attitude that plain style's conception of truth is fundamentally wrong. He takes the central verbal cliché of plain style — truth is pure and simple — and refines it. Oakeshott, although not working from a specific verbal cliché, similarly introduces a conceptual refinement, one transforming crude polar categories into degrees along a gradient. Geertz takes two clichés of ethnography — to expose is to reduce; to see normality is to miss particularity — and recasts their terms into a specific and refined four-way balance. La Rochefoucauld takes conditions normally conceived of as distinct — belonging to a category versus striving to belong — and observes their inseparability in the case of becoming established in「the world,」where appearance is so nearly everything that careful imitation of a social state is an effective way of achieving it. Pope, a master of the phrase that illustrates its own meaning, reconsiders the crude opposition of force to grace and makes the fine observation that they share a common source in conciseness.

Neither Geertz nor Pope explicitly rejects an established verbal cliché, but each tacitly rejects a conceptual commonplace without making a fuss about it. Geertz implicitly rejects the notion that to expose a culture is to make it like all the rest, and Pope actually demonstrates that grace and force are not mutually exclusive. In each case, the effect is something like that of a brilliant move in chess; it was there all along and seems inevitable once made, but to see it in the first instance requires an uncommon refinement of perception.

You imagine what you desire; you will what you imagine; and at last, you create what you will.

— Bernard Shaw, the serpent speaking to Eve in Back to

Methuselah

The thought expressed in this passage has three steps. They are schematically identical. In each, an activity is located and then linked to its source in a different activity. There is a sentence expressing each step. Each of these sentences inherits the schematic structure of the thought, as in「You imagine what you desire.」Paired activities are expressed as paired clauses — 「you imagine」and「you desire」 — and the conceptual link between paired activities is mirrored in the linguistic link between paired clauses.

These three steps are not independent, but are ordered as a temporal sequence in which the product of one step serves as the source of the next. The grammatical structure mirrors this conceptual sequence: three sentences of the same grammatical form occur in linear order; the clause referring to the product in one sentence serves to refer to the source in the next.

Shaw's passage — with its precise and detailed combination of schematic images — is the result of conceptual and linguistic work, but the work is not exhibited. Reading the sentence is like watching a champion gymnast perform a routine on the parallel bars. Obviously the gymnastic performance is the result of previous work, but only the achievement is exhibited.

The achievement is final. In the classic view, thought comes first and language is sufficient to express it. Any problem of expression has an exact solution in the language, and this solution, once found, will appear to be obvious, perfect, and definitive. The writer knows when he has finished revising.

Perfection of phrasing in classic style is assumed to follow from precision of preceding thought. The classic writer draws precise conceptual distinctions and locates exact conceptual relations until the analysis is finished. He then expresses the result of this analysis. Its schematic conceptual structure is mirrored in the schematic linguistic structure. Often, the result appears to be something like a mathematical formulation.

In classic style, the goal of analysis is truth in its most efficient form consistent with accuracy. Expression, carrying the elegance that comes from compressed energy, is like a perfectly tuned stringed instrument: the strings are taut to exact degrees to correspond to exact pitches that stand in exact relations to one another. The pitches and their relations exist before the strings are tuned. Each string is tuned to a pitch and the results are judged by comparison to this pre-existing reality. A musician tuning an instrument is not finished until everything is exactly right, but once it is exactly right, there is simply nothing left to do.

Similarly, in the classic view, the thought exists before the expression, and the expression is judged by comparing it with the pre-existing thought. In writing a sentence, a writer knows when he has it exactly right, after which there is nothing left to do.

Shaw's sentence knows when to stop because it expresses a complete analysis. It might be contrasted with the following passage — written by an editor for the influential journal he edits — which isn't over even when it is over.

The concept of spatial form has unquestionably been central to modern criticism not only of literature but of the fine arts and of language and of culture in general. Indeed, the consistent goal of the natural and human sciences in the twentieth century has been the discovery and/or construction of synchronic structural models to account for concrete phenomena.

Classic style is not exclusive. A writer's position or status cannot make her a classic writer, or bar her from becoming a classic writer. An undergraduate at a junior college wrote the following classic passage in her discussion of the spatial form of Rembrandt's Old Man with a Gold Chain:

Rembrandt was a very young man when he painted this picture, but it is a work demonstrating the insight and wisdom of an older man. It is a poignant picture and painful to look upon because it is not just a painting of a man, but an expression of mortality.

. . . l'amour-propre & la confiance en nous-mêmes, qu'il sait si bien nous inspirer, nous sollicitent à tirer des conséquences qui ne dérivent pas immédiatement des faits; en sorte que nous sommes en quelque façon intéressés à nous séduire nous-mêmes.

[. . . self-love and self-confidence (which so easily inspires us) tempt us to draw consequences that do not derive immediately from facts; so that we become in a fashion interested in deceiving ourselves.]

— Antoine Laurent Lavoisier,「Discours préliminaire」to Traité élémentaire de chimie

On n'est jamais si heureux ni si malheureux qu'on s'imagine.

[One is never so happy or unhappy as one thinks.]

 — François VI, duc de La Rochefoucauld, Maximes

Car il me semblait que je pourrais rencontrer beaucoup plus de vérité dans les raisonnements que chacun fait touchant les affaires qui lui importent, et dont l'événement le doit punir bientôt après s'il a mal jugé, que dans ceux que fait un homme de lettres dans son cabinet, touchant des spéculations qui ne produisent aucun effect, et qui ne lui sont d'autre conséquence, sinon que peut-être il en tirera d'autant plus de vanité qu'elles seront plus éloignées du sens commun. . . .

[For it seemed to me that I could find a great deal more truth in the reasonings everyone makes concerning his own affairs, and whose consequences will quickly make him suffer if he has made a mistake, than in those made by a man of letters in his study, concerning speculations that have no effect whatever, and no consequence for him except perhaps to allow him to feel prouder according as they are further from common sense. . . .]

— René Descartes, Discours de la méthode

. . . la puissance de bien juger et distinguer le vrai d'avec le faux, qui est proprement ce qu'on nomme le bon sens ou la raison, est naturellement égale en tous les hommes; et ainsi, que la diversité de nos opinions ne vient pas de ce que les uns sont plus raisonnable que les autres, mais seulement de ce que nous conduisons nos pensées par diverses voies, et ne considérons pas les mêmes choses. Car ce n'est pas assez d'avoir l'esprit bon, mais le principal est de l'appliquer bien. Les plus grandes âmes sont capables des plus grands vices aussi bien que des plus grandes vertus, et ceux qui ne marchent que fort lentement peuvent avancer beaucoup d'avantage, s'ils suivent toujours le droit chemin, que ne font ceux qui courent, et qui s'en éloignent.

[. . . the power to judge well and to distinguish the true from the false, which is properly what one calls common sense or reason, is naturally equal in everyone; and thus the diversity of our opinions does not come from some of us being more reasonable than others, but only from our conducting our thoughts in different ways and not considering the same things. For it is not enough to have a sound mind but the principal point is to apply it well. The greatest souls are capable of the greatest vices as well as the greatest virtues, and those who walk only very slowly can get much further ahead if they always keep to the right way than those who run in another direction.]

 — René Descartes, Discours de la méthode

This juxtaposition of classic French texts — from chemistry, philosophy, and the observation of human behavior — very nearly speaks for itself. While everyone is endowed with reason, everyone's reason is compromised by self-deception and self-interest. Classic thought depends upon finding a way, through discipline, of avoiding these frailties and avoiding, too, pride at having avoided them. This is of course impossible.

The self cannot be escaped, but it can be, with ingenuity and hard work, distracted.

— Donald Barthelme,「Daumier」

Classic style lends itself to the expression of a complete temperament in a single statement. People who do not like this style think of this feature as a narrowness, a sameness that falls into routine or self-parody; people who admire the style think of its aphoristic character as a consistency that is something like integrity. Barthelme's sentence is much more than a statement or an observation. It is the expression of an attitude toward life. It is like the autobiography of a temperament in miniature. Its subject is central to the temperament in question — the self, conceived as a sort of cage. Naturally, someone in a cage would like to get out, but the first clause assures us there is no escape. Curiously, this situation leads neither to despair nor to passivity but to action. For,「with hard work and ingenuity,」the victim of selfhood can achieve if not the ideal goal then the most desirable practical alternative. It is a rather bleak picture of the world, but one in which there is a surprising reason to value effort and skill.

This temperament is at odds with the temperament found in Jefferson or Descartes, neither of whom begins with a restriction on basic human possibilities. Temperaments of resignation similar to Barthelme's can be found, however, in a few notable classic French writers of the seventeenth century. La Rochefoucauld, for example, assumes that there are fundamental restrictions on basic human possibilities: self-knowledge is unavailable and the knowledge one has of others, if correct, always reveals them to be acting from self-interest. La Rochefoucauld's maxim「On n'est jamais si heureux ni si malheureux qu'on s'imagine」(One is never as happy or as unhappy as one imagines) expresses a temperament resigned to unalterable restrictions on human possibilities.

Barthelme's thought is globally structured by a schematic movement to a goal, in two impulses: a failed step toward an ideal goal — marked as impossible — and a subsequent step to a substitute. The first impulse is desire, the second, acceptance. The second impulse is interrupted right before it comes to its expected end by a consideration of the unanticipated and quite difficult requirements for attaining this inferior but possible goal.

The sentence imitates the schematic form of the thought it expresses: it moves directly toward a goal to be rejected (escape) and then moves from the rejected goal toward the available goal (distraction). Grammatically, we expect a participle to follow「can be.」

But the sentence takes an unexpected grammatical detour, through a parenthesis. This grammatical detour creates a sense of the distraction to which the end of the sentence refers.

Inserting the parenthesis「with ingenuity and hard work」into the final verb phrase destroys the symmetry of a radical version of this sentence:「The self cannot be escaped, but it can be distracted.」Adding this nuance suggests a distinction between the fantasy of escape and the arduous work of distraction. Escape, because it is impossible, is not burdened with conditions. Distraction belongs to a different order of things, an order neither so desirable nor so uncomplicated as the order of fantasy.

In the classic view, truth comes with structure that is part of its meaning and is preferably to be inherited by its expression. The structure of expression is therefore, by this inheritance, meaningful — two grammatically equivalent expressions can have different meanings. Let us consider two such expressions:

The self cannot be escaped, but it can be, with ingenuity and hard work, distracted.

The self cannot be escaped, but with ingenuity and hard work it can be distracted.

The first has a schematic structure of derailment, delay, distraction, and arduousness in reaching a goal. It inherits this structure from the thought it expresses. The second does not have this schematic structure. The difference is only a nuance, but the nuance is indispensable.

Classic style is highly attentive to nuance, and as a consequence is highly sensitive to the schematic structure of expression. In the classic view, nuance is neither arbitrary nor decorative; it is meaning. Nuance is recognized through discipline and precision and can be lost sight of through carelessness. Classic style lives on fine distinctions. However fine they may be, their significance is absolute. Two things that are almost the same are in fact different, and classic style was invented as an instrument for presenting such careful discriminations.

Classic expression presents the simplest accurate result of analysis. It presupposes that an analysis has been completed, and it is distinguished by expressing the result in the simplest accurate form. The thought locates exact distinctions, exact relations, exact objects and forms; the expression presents this analyzed array. The expression is clear and simple as the truth, but no clearer or simpler. Barthelme's sentence is classic in expressing a precise analysis. It does this clearly and simply without blurring the fine distinctions indispensable to the thought.

They fuck you up, your mum and dad. They may not mean to, but they do.

— Philip Larkin, from「This Be The Verse」in High Windows

These two sentences, here set out as prose, are the first two lines of a twelve-line poem. Although Larkin uses conventional poetic forms of meter and rhyme, he imparts to his poetry the sound of talk — casual, spontaneous, conversational. His best poetry not only aspires to, but achieves the condition of classic prose.

His first line,「They fuck you up, your mum and dad,」sounds like a conversational observation; the words seem to be as commonplace as the thought, but they unobtrusively give vitality back to the cliché they express. The observation crystallizes a vast and indefinite history of personal experience without incorporating any of it, and the reader is expected to be able to confirm the truth immediately from her own experience.

His next line,「They may not mean to, but they do,」sounds like an afterthought. In fact, it is an example of the writer doing all the work invisibly. Larkin deliberately avoids the surface brilliance of classic writers such as La Rochefoucauld, or Shaw, or Wilde, preferring instead the maximum understatement of his capacity and labor — on a casual reading, their very existence can go unsuspected. These lines are however a deliberate presentation after the writer has done quite a lot of invisible work. Try any alternative — 「your mum and dad fuck you up even if they don't mean to,」for example — and see how flat and unmemorable this unforgettable little text becomes.

We can begin to see how careful and studied this passage actually is, despite its deceptively casual presentation, if we consider Larkin's choice of words. A moment's reflection will establish that your mum and dad are not the same as your mother and father or your mommy and daddy or dad and mom. The phrase「mum and dad」is a set phrase used to refer to parents as they inhabit a particular role with respect to their children. A native speaker of English, particularly British English, knows exactly when and under what circumstances to use this phrase, but the amount and variety of this knowledge is vast. It is the perfect phrase for referring to parents in Larkin's text because it is precisely in their capacity as「mum and dad」that they「fuck you up.」The language has supplied a perfect phrase for crystallizing the extraordinarily complicated normal history wherein parents not deficient as parents nonetheless routinely, predictably, and inevitably debilitate their children.「They may not mean to, but they do.」

Profanity is almost never encountered in classic prose, exactly because the usual reasons for using it are unclassic. It is rarely a precise instrument of presentation and often has the effect of slurring or smudging an observation. The nonstandard「mum and dad,」the vulgar「fuck you up」exceptionally in this text fit their subject precisely. As a result, the expression itself, while disguised as commonplace, is unstridently memorable and undeniably certified by the culture whose artifacts are these phrases.

The novels of Theodore Dreiser, Marxist political rhetoric, the landscape of northern New Jersey, souvenir shops in airports — these have the special qualities of an ugly which is at once settled into itself, varied in its particulars, yet bound to go on and on interminably.

— Robert Martin Adams, Bad Mouth

Mme de Chevreuse avait beaucoup d'esprit, d'ambition et de beauté; elle était galante, vive, hardie, entreprenante; elle se servait de tous ses charmes pour réussir dans ses desseins, et elle a presque toujours porté malheur aux personnes qu'elle y a engagées.

[Madame de Chevreuse had sparkling intelligence, ambition, and beauty in plenty; she was flirtatious, lively, bold, enterprising; she used all her charms to push her projects to success, and she almost always brought disaster to those she encountered on her way.]

— La Rochefoucauld, Mémoires

When La Rochefoucauld wrote his description of Madame de Chevreuse, Theodore Dreiser had written no novels, there was no Marxist political rhetoric, the landscapes of northern New Jersey were unexplored by English professors, there were no souvenir shops in airports, there were no airports. He and Robert Martin Adams are each saturated in local knowledge of a certain kind, but they live in different worlds and speak of different things. Yet their observations share a great deal if we consider not what they have to say but how they arrange what they say.

Each of them builds carefully to a point, a point known from the beginning but reserved and prepared for so that it will achieve its maximum effect without seeming to be forced. Each of them assumes a pose of abundant and assured experience from which he speaks. They succeed in turning away the normal temptation to question their unargued judgments because they do not betray any anxiety by overstatement. Adams is disarming in suggesting that he is familiar with not just this kind of ugly but other varieties as well. It is as if the question of these things being ugly is settled; he is concerned only to make sure he has placed them in the right category of ugly.

La Rochefoucauld succeeds in suggesting that he has a wide acquaintance among women, some of them attractive, others talented or ambitious, none of them quite like Madame de Chevreuse. Both La Rochefoucauld and Adams speak from a secure haven. Adams is not threatened by the bleak and eternal ugly he delineates; La Rochefoucauld will not be enlisted in any of Madame de Chevreuse's projects. Their position of safety suggests that they have no urgent interest in getting their readers to believe what they say, and this implicit claim is supported by the structure and tone of the sentences themselves.

Adams's sentence has a musing tone to it and certainly his own expression has not been invaded by any variety of the ugly. La Rochefoucauld is not eager to say anything negative about Madame de Chevreuse; there is a tone of appreciation and equity to his description. The proven danger of associating with her does not subtract from her attractive qualities, which are abundant andnot commonly united in a single person. Consider how different the effect would be if he had said,「Even though Madame de Chevreuse was beautiful, intelligent, . . .」

While neither of these sentences expresses the least doubt and both make positive, unshaded judgments that might court a reader's resistance, they distract resistance by making the sort of fine distinctions that are the expression of serene, unrushed judgment. Such distinctions cannot be made casually; they are the result of work, observation, testing — something like research. None of this effort is allowed to show, however, in the expression; even the writing is made to sound easy. Neither writer suggests that he has considered ways of disarming a reader's impulse to question, although each of them has anticipated problems and devised solutions.

Although each word has been carefully weighed and carefully placed, the finished sentences suggest spontaneous speech. It is only on reflection that we see how impossible it would be for someone spontaneously to say something so complex and perfect. (Almost any change in either sentence would be a change for the worse.) Neither writer wants to suggest that what he is doing is work. That is why so much work has gone into getting this writing to suggest speech; writing suggests effort and work, persuasive writing suggests strategy. To make writing imitate speech is a great deal of work and yet the happy phrase that is just right and suggests that it is just right simply because it is true can happen in conversation — usually after a lot of forgotten false starts.

All these shared characteristics are what makes it possible to see these sentences as stylistically similar, even though they do not share a subject or even a language.

A heroic, photographically literal statue of [Huey Long] stands on a high pedestal above his grave in the Capitol grounds. The face impudent, porcine and juvenal, is turned toward the building he put up — all thirty-four stories of it — in slightly more than a year, mostly with Federal money. The bronze double-breasted jacket, tight over the plump belly, has already attained the dignity of a period costume, like Lincoln's frock coat. In bronze, Huey looks like all the waggish fellows from Asheville and Nashville, South Bend and Topeka, who used to fill our costlier speakeasies in the late twenties and early thirties. He looks like a golf-score-and-dirty-joke man, anxious for the good opinion of everybody he encounters. Seeing him there made me feel sad and old. A marble Pegasus carved in bas-relief below his feet bears a scroll that says,「Share Our Wealth.」That was one of Huey's slogans; another was「Every Man a King.」

— A. J. Liebling, The Earl of Louisiana

In this last chapter I wish to observe and trace the transformation of American Africanism from its simplistic, though menacing, purposes of establishing hierarchic difference to its surrogate properties as self-reflexive meditations on the loss of the difference, to its lush and fully blossomed existence in the rhetoric of dread and desire.

— Toni Morrison, Playing in the Dark: Whiteness and the Literary Imagination

Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, in a New York Times review of Toni Morrison's essay Playing in the Dark and her novel Jazz, cited this sentence as an example of the essay's style, which he contrasted with what he called the poetry of her novel. He expressed disapproval of「the style she employs to make her points.」His tacit and conventional assumption, almost an enabling convention in journalism, is that style is completely separable from thought. Morrison, accordingly, should have presented her thought in a more immediately intelligible style. This is the same assumption that underwrites the many programs for correcting prose by giving its surface a final jiggle to shake out blemishes and clots.

The difficulty in Morrison's sentence lies not in its surface but in its thought. The image-schematic structure of the sentence — spatial movement along a path from location to location — is basic and classic. Here is an immediately intelligible sentence formed on that image schema:

I want to observe and trace the history of Christianity as it moved from its origin as a Jewish heresy, to the state religion of the Roman Empire, to the high religion of medieval Europe.

Combined with this image schema is a basic metaphor: ideas, beliefs, and institutions — which are not physical objects and which do not move — can be understood metaphorically as physical objects that do move; different states are metaphorically different locations; transformation is metaphorically movement from one spatial location to another; the history of an idea, a belief, or an institution can be「followed」by「tracing」visually the「path」「traced」by its「movement」in historical time. Morrison's sentence and the sentence about Christianity are equally built upon this union of metaphor and image schema. But the sentence about Christianity is immediately intelligible while Morrison's is not. The difference lies in the conception of subject.

Classic style conceives of its subject, whether concrete or abstract, as a publicly available「thing」clear and distinct at all levels — from anatomy to fine detail. This cultural「thing」can be acknowledged by any competent observer who looks at it. Its existence is independent of the writer's conception and certainly independent of the writer's prose. A subject conceived of in this way as a「thing」fits nicely the image schema of spatial movement and the metaphor of change as spatial movement.

Even if a reader cannot offer any precise description of Christianity, and may be barely able to distinguish it from Buddhism, it will be acknowledged by most likely readers of The New York Times — and certainly by Christopher Lehmann-Haupt — as if it were observable in the same sense that the statue of Huey Long on the Capitol grounds in Baton Rouge is observable.「American Africanism,」unlike Christianity, calls attention to itself as an abstraction precisely because it does not have the sort of agreed-about borders, however imprecise, that a concept needs before it leaves the status of special conception intelligible to special audiences and becomes a vulgar cliché indistinguishable for rhetorical purposes from a planet whose path can be traced.

A similar difficulty attaches to the three stages of American Africanism's history, all of which are unfamiliar abstractions, none of which has general currency in contemporary American culture.「Medieval Europe」is also an abstraction, but it has general currency; a reader of The New York Times can be expected to accept such an abstraction as definite and legitimate even if that reader's image of medieval Europe is completely featureless, since such a reader will believe he could, so to speak, look it up.「The rhetoric of dread and desire」does not enjoy a similar standing, so that the lush and fully blossomed existence of American Africanism in the rhetoric of dread and desire is an existence that cannot be accepted as a matter of course.

Morrison is not offering arbitrarily difficult descriptions of what can be described in「another style,」that is, more accessible language. She is talking about special concepts without common currency whose very existence depends on her thought. As a result, the passage features an asymmetry between writer and reader that marks her style as unclassic. A writer presenting such a subject in classic style could not trace a movement before establishing the reality of American Africanism down to quite fine details, so that the reader can accept it as a「thing」he can experience. The model scene would have to be substituted unobtrusively for an actual scene of persuasion, and the classic writer would have to persuade his reader that she can accept American Africanism the way she can accept the planet Venus, and that the path of American Africanism can be traced the way an astronomer can trace the planet's path. The abstract nature of the subject is no impediment to such a conception: a cultural historian like Chastel, a connoisseur of old painting like Friedländer, a New Testament interpreter like Dodd, a mathematical physicist like Feynman, an observer of the emotions like Madame de Lafayette, and an observer of society like Madame de Sévigné can present the most abstract matters in the most abstract fields as if they were talking about statues, strawberries, or the evening star.

The passage from A. J. Liebling describing the statue of Huey Long may seem at first glance to have nothing in common with the passage from Toni Morrison. Morrison is talking about a cultural abstraction and its sequence of change; Liebling is talking about a static statue that anyone standing at Huey Long's grave can see. The juxtaposition of these passages may suggest an attempt to illustrate the advice of so many writing manuals to be「concrete,」and to avoid abstractions. It is, of course, impossible either to think or write without using abstractions, so like most scattershot advice, the mantra「be concrete, avoid abstractions」is generally useless in practice. The mantra is nevertheless at least remotely related to a sound observation about style, in the way, for example, that the phrase「you can't be certain of anything」is related to Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.

Liebling's description of Huey Long's statue turns on concepts about American culture in the 1920s and 1930s that are as abstract as anything in Toni Morrison's passage and are at least as personal to Liebling as anything Morrison says about the movement of American Africanism is personal to her. The stylistic difference between them rests on how they treat those abstractions. It is easy to feel excluded from Morrison's vision of American Africanism because she does not choose to conceive of her subject as a「thing」that anyone can verify. As a result, the abstract nature of her concepts is put into relief, and she leaves the reader with the choice of either accepting what she says or considering it, to a greater or lesser degree, an arbitrarily personal vision.

Liebling demonstrates a typical classic elision from what is easy for any reader to see for herself — the statue — to his highly personal interpretation, based on abstract cultural and ethical concepts. He never says that anyone else can see the cultural matrix into which he places the statue; he treats that matrix as a matter of course and suggests that its finest details can be delineated by anyone who was there. As a result, it requires deliberate analysis to realize that while anyone can verify the existence of the statue and the inscription on the scroll (「Share Our Wealth」), the interpretation that has been slipped between the description of the statue and the description of the scroll can be seen by no one who does not agree to accept Liebling's reflection as a thing. This agreement, Liebling recognizes, requires persuasion, but he never explicitly acknowledges a need to persuade. Instead, he addresses his problem by artful juxtaposition and tacit assurances that what he supplies (whether fact or interpretation) is as reliable as what is right there in front of him and — accidents of time and place aside — can be right there in front of you. Consider the comparison between「Share Our Wealth,」the slogan actually carved on the scroll, and「Every Man a King,」which Liebling cites as another of Huey Long's slogans. The second slogan is nowhere to be seen at the gravesite, but it is one of Huey Long's best-known lines. Liebling's claim can be verified by anyone who checks the relevant sources. It is only an invisible step to treat the interpretation as something that can be verified in the relevant sources too, and it is a classic technique to distract the reader from observing that the relevant source in this case is the writer's imagination.

有了这个真相，我不可能还说服不了你相信我的清白。

她跟他说话的语气如此笃定，即使是看起来不大可能的真相也很容易让人信服，以至克莱夫芙先生几乎相信她的清白。

—— 拉法耶特夫人，《克莱芙王妃》1

以上两个选段均选自《克莱芙王妃》里的场景，王妃在她丈夫临终前试图说服丈夫相信她没有背叛他。虽然她有自己的私心，但这个场景仍然是古典风格，因为王妃是一个杰出人物，对真相怀有自律又虔诚的忠诚，她的动机是尊重真相而非为己谋私。我们选入这些段落，是因为它们阐释了古典风格概念中的真相，因为它们明确将那种概念中的真相与说服关联起来。9

真相即使不是看起来那么回事，也有足够的说服力，这种坚定不仅属于她最著名的小说中的叙述者，也属于拉法耶特夫人本人。这不是一个天真的人不切实际的想法。拉法耶特夫人是路易十四的小姨子亨利埃塔的密友，而且跟国王接触密切。虽然不清楚细节，但拉法耶特夫人在改治问题上表现活跃 —— 尤其对一个女人来说。她代表萨沃伊公爵夫人游说法国法院，并通过她让法国人了解阿马德乌斯公爵的秘密政策决定。1670 年亨利埃塔去世后，拉法耶特夫人因为健康状况不佳退出了法院，但法院的实权人物随后多年继续去巴黎探访她。1672 年，她与法国国王同席用餐庆祝《凡尔赛和约》的签订，对国王的陆军大臣卢瓦依然有很大影响力。她见证了数十起因为政治阴谋声名鹊起又名誉尽毁的事件，她深刻地认识到，一种显然客观公正的陈述方式具有多么大的力量。人们都知道她素来尊重真相，也鄙视软弱之人逃避令人不快的真相。

她最喜欢的游说方式是私下对话。偏见、利益或激情或许会阻碍真相被接受，正如这里引用的她的小说段落所述那样。但在她的观念里，即小说中王妃的观念，真相具有天然的说服力，这种说服力如此强大，即使不是表面上看起来的那回事，任何一位公允的听众都会信服。正是奉行这种原则，她建立的职业生涯令所有现代政治律师或说客羡慕不已。

我们很容易怀疑这不是古典风格的场景，因为王妃显然有自己的利益考量，但她采取的姿态是，无论她可能感受到什么样的直接压力，她的最高首选动机都是真相。正如她所说：「我承认，激情可以引导我，但还没有强大到可以蒙蔽我（J'avoue que les passions peuvent me conduire, mais elles ne sauraient m'aveugler）。」

我们无法控制我们的利益 —— 我们没有能力让自己时刻保持客观中立 —— 但没必要让那些利益支配我们的行为，哪怕我们需要极大的自制力来抵制利益的诱惑。通常，我们很难相信那些声称不考虑自身利益的人。正因为如此，拉法耶特夫人才费心思为王妃这个人物塑造遵守纪律的形象。一但同时用概括和事件塑造出人物形象，读者就有可能相信，尽管有利益方面的压力，古典风格真相仍是她的最高动机。这一动机，即使可能受到个人利益的诱惑，仍然可以指导任何愿意遵守特殊纪律的人的行为。当读者相信一个可能受个人利益影响的人，实际上依据真相行事时，这种古典概念 —— 真相无论看起来多么不可能发生，都自带说服力 —— 会产生一种让人非信不可的效果。

古典概念中的说服，只是建立一个古典场景，在这个场景中，真相最终替代了所有实际或可能的利益动机。在一个牵涉利益的情境中，无论说话者用什么方式，只要能建立这种场景，就相当于打破了人总是受利益支配这个刻板印象。

总体来说，人们可能会受利益支配，但并不意味着无论在什么场合每个人都会受利益支配。尊重真相的古典风格作者则属于贵族阶层任何人只要愿意遵循古典风格的纪律，都可以成为这样的贵族。

选段 5-2

哈代是更早年代的图灵；他是另一位普通的英国同性恋无神论者，只是恰好是世界上最优秀的数学家之一。

—— 安德鲁·霍奇斯，《艾伦·图灵传 —— 如谜的解谜者》2

如果用几句犀利的话就能总结伟大历史事件的教训，那么研究历史对于政治教有来说就没有必要了。我们只需要几句总结的活就行了。但政治上的严谨，并不是口头可以传授的：它是一种必须付出吸辛才能获得的品质。一本好的指南如果能够带你领略其他人的重要经历，那么它就能为你省下很多心力。它只是告诉你最需要知道的，不会告诉你太多：比如为什么采取这一步，这一步如何让事情变成灾难。你需要自己去思考，为什么它变成了灾难性的事情，如何做可以避免一只有自己去判断，一个人才能获得政治教育；在那个领域，像所有其他领域一样，只有独立思考，才能学到东西。

—— 伯纳德·德·茹弗内尔，修昔底德《伯罗奔尼搬战争史》

托马斯·霍布斯译本「序言」3

霍奇斯的句子有一条不容辩驳的断言，虽然本身无可争议：在他所处的时代，G. H. 哈代是世界上最优秀的数学家之一。还有另一条更有观点的隐含断言：伟大的数学家在其他方面可能相当普通。最后一条不易察觉的断言是：无论对伟大的数学家这些特殊群体而言，还是对整个群体而言，同性恋或无神论者没有什么不正常的。

哈代是剑桥大学教授纯粹数学的萨德菜里恩（Sadleirian）讲座教授，于自杀未遂之后的那一年（1947）年逝世，享年 70 岁；艾伦·图灵被指控为性罪犯，被判处荷尔蒙「治疗」，于 1954 年自杀，享年 42 岁。在他们生活的时代和地方，人们通常难以将反常的现象联想到杰出人士。

作为一名反对把同性恋当作疾病的数学家，霍奇斯选取了一些典型案例证明：在图灵生活的年代，英国人的同性恋观以及这些观念给同性恋的生活带来的影响。他的书当然会鼓励对待这种问题的某些态度，也会否定其他态度，但用了古典风格的策略来表明自己的观点。这本书的力量不在于作者公开地论证，而是把呈现本身当作无形的论证。

这种无形的论证，没有试图指出其他观点的不足，也没有为自己的观点据理力争。它几乎只告诉读者往哪看。在这段中，霍奇斯试图让读者处于某种视角中，让读者将「同性恋、无神论者」与「伟大的数学家」融合在一起。有些人听到「同性恋无神论者」可能会感到震惊，怎么都不可能将其和「伟大的数学家」联系起来。但霍奇斯既没有自以为是，也没有高人一等。他说得好像他的读者当然知道，正如他知道一样，一位同性恋无神论者，可以是普通的英国人，也可以是伟大的数学家。

乍看之下，伯纳德·德·茹弗内尔的选段看起来与霍奇斯的选段相似。和霍奇斯一样，茹弗内尔直接断定，而不是事无巨细地逐一论证。

但这些断言呈现的并不是读者理所当然会看到的真相。茹弗内尔的文章虽然没有曲解，但也不像即兴说话。他的断言像一段论证的开头，尽管后面并无论证。这一段话偏离了古典风格典型的场景和角色。这个场景不是同辈的对话，而是教授对大二学生的教海。作者为自己克服困难所得的智慧而自豪，让读者相信他的话，因为他比他们知道得更多，而不是因为他们站在同样的视角可以验证他说的话。他的观点看似有理，表达清楚，但实际上是某种形式的自以为是。它不是古典风格，尽管句子写得不错，也总结了一个漂亮的（不劳而获的）泛论。

选段 5-3

真相很少纯粹，也绝不简单。

理解一个民族的文化，即在不削弱其特殊性的情况下，昭示出其常态。

为了在社会上获得成功，人们就竭力做出在社会上已经成功的样子。

—— 拉罗什福科，《道德藏言录》① 6

毋庸置疑，论证或教导要想同时表现出力量和优雅，大部分取决于它们是否简洁。

这里不存在与间接的或复杂的东西相对的直接的或「自然的」东西：在此存在的只是不同的复杂性程度而已。

—— 迈克尔·奥克肖特，《经脸及其模式》① 8

选段 5-3 中的五个短句，按照年代先后，最早的写于十七世纪，最晚的写于二十世纪。各自所处的文化不同，表达目的不同，甚至连语言也不同，它们出现在完全不同类型的作品中，但有类似的结构特点。每句话都有一个鲜明的观点，精妙而「简单」，一旦说出来，就必然如此。

它们有着相同的立场：他们看到的，好像是不经意的发现，只要正确地指出来，读者也会看到。读者非常乐意「验证」每位作者的言论，尽管每种言论是基于普通观察提炼出的新发现。

王尔德（Wilde）在他最著名的戏剧作品《不可儿戏》（The Importance of Being Earnest）中，充分表明了一种态度，即平实风格概念中的真相根本不对。他取材于平实风格常用的陈词滥调 —— 真相纯粹且简单 —— 并做了提炼。奥克肖特虽然不是用某个现成的陈词滥调，但同样做了概念提炼，将粗略的两极分化改成了由浅及深的程度变化。格尔茨提取了人种论的两种陈词滥调 —— 要彰显就得削弱，要看到常态就得失去特殊性 —— 并改写了它们的条件使其形成一种具体的四方平衡状态。拉罗什福科选择了通常被认为对立的情况 ——「属于什么样的人」对应「努力成为什么样的人」—— 并观察到二者在取得社会上的成功这方面密不可分，表象几乎是一切，以至于认真模仿某种社会状态是达到这种状态的有效方式。蒲柏的写作风格以简洁见长，用简洁证明了这个词自身的含义，他重新思考了「优雅」和「力量」这二者的简单对立，细致地发现二者都源于「简洁」。

格尔茨和蒲柏都没有正面驳斥公认的陈词滥调，但不动声色地否定了没有新意的概念。格尔茨间接反对了彰显一种文化就要让它跟所有其他文化一样的主张。而蒲柏实际上展示了优雅与力量并非相互排斥。每个例子的效果就像下象棋时的精彩一招；它自始至终都在那里，一旦决定，似乎只能这么做，但要一开始就看出来，需要不同寻常的敏锐洞察力。

意像图式

选段 5-4

你想象你所渴望之物；你寻求你所想象之物；最后，你创造你所寻求之物。

—— 萧伯钠，《千岁人》，蛇对夏娃说的话 9

选段 5-4 的思想有三个层级。它们的图式结构完全相同。每个层级都发生一项活动，这项活动又成为下面一项活动的发端。一个层级对应一句话表达。每句话都沿袭了思想的图式结构，比如「你想象你所渴望之物」这句话。活动两两一组，表达成句子也是两两一组 ——「你想象」和「你渴望」—— 组活动的概念关系反映在一组从句的语言关系中。

这三个层级并非相互独立，而是按时间顺序排列的：一个层级的末端是下一个层级的开端。这种概念顺序反映在语法结构上：三个句子语法形式相同，呈线性排列；指称一个句子末端的分句，用来指称下一个句子的发端。

萧伯纳的这段话 —— 精准贴合意象图式 —— 正是概念与语言相互匹配的结果，但这种匹配过程没有被展示出来。阅读这些句子犹如观看一位体操冠军表演一套双杠动作。显然，这套体操表演是先前训练的结果，展现给观众的只是成果。

成果是最完美的呈现。在古典视角中，思想先于语言，语言足以表达思想。任何表达问题都可以在语言中找到合适的解决方案，这种方案一旦找到，看起来理所应当、完美且无以复加。作者知道调整到什么程度才算结束。

古典风格措辞完美被认为是前期思想准确的结果。完成全部分析后古典风格作者精准区分出概念差异并确立准确的概念关系。然后他把这种分析结果表达出来。它在概念上的图式结构体现在语言的图式结构中。这种结果看起来常常像数学公式。

在古典风格中，分析的目的是找到最高效、最准确的真相。表达因言简意丰而优雅，就像一件调弦完美的弦乐器：每根琴弦拉紧到特定程度，发出特定的音高，这种音高与其他音高构成特定关系。琴弦的音高和音高间的关系在调弦之前就已存在。每根琴弦调试到各自音高后，对照这个早已存在的事实可以判断演奏的效果。乐手调试乐器直到一切都刚刚好才算完成，一旦调到刚刚好的状态，也就没什么要做的了。

同样，在古典视角中，思想先于表达存在，对照早就存在的思想可以判断表达的好坏。作者写句子，知道什么时候刚刚好，之后就没什么要做的了。

萧伯纳的句子知道什么时候结束，因为他表达了完整的分析。可以将它和下面一段话对比。这是一位编辑为他服务的一本有影响力的杂志写的，句子虽然结束了，实际却没写完。

空间形式概念无疑对现代批评极为重要，不仅是文学批译，通常还有美术批评、语言批评和文化批评。事实上，二十世纪自然科学和人文科学从始至终的目标是发现和（或）构建解释具体现象的共时结构模式。10

古典风格不是谁的专属风格。作者的地位或身份不会帮助他成为一名古典风格作者，但也不会妨碍他成为一名古典风格作者。一名本科生在讨论伦勃朗（Rembrandt）的画《戴金项链的老者》（Old Man with a Gold Chain）的空间形式时，用古典风格写出了下面这段话：

伦勃朗画这福画时还是一位非常年轻的小伙子，但这幅画晨示了一位长者的羽见和智慧。这是一福悲楚的画，看着令人痛苦，因为它不单是一张年轻人的画作，也是一种对死亡的表达。11

选段 5-5

......自负，与我们沉溺其中的自信，促使我们引出那些并非直接源于事实的各种结论：结果我们变得有几分爱好自欺。

—— 安托万-洛朗·拉瓦锡，《化学基础论》序言 ① 12

① 汉译文选自任定成翻译版本。—— 译者注

人从来不像自己想象的那么章福，也并非自已想象的那么不幸。

—— 拉罗什福科，《道德藏言录》3

因为在我看来，普通人的推理所包含的真理要比读书人的推理所包含的多得多：普通人是对切身的事情进行推理，如果判断错了，它的结果马上就会来惩罚他：读书人是关在书房里对思排的道理进行推理，思辩是不产生任何实效的，仅仅在他身上造成一种后果，就是思辨离常识越远，他由此产生的虚荣心大概就越大…...

—— 勒内·笛卡儿，《谈谈方法》14

…...那种正确判断、辦别真假的能力，也就是我们称为良知或理性的那种东西，本来就是人人均等的：我们的意见之所以有分歧，并不是由于有些人的理性多些，有些人的理性少些，而只是由于我们运用思想的途径不同，所考察的对象不是一回事。因为单有聪明才智是不够的，主要在于正确地运用才智。杰出的人才固然能够做出最大的好事，也同样可以做出最大的坏事：行动十分缓慢的人只要始终循着正道前进，就可以比离开正道飞奔的人走在前面很多。

—— 勒内·笛卡儿，《谈谈方法》5

将这些古典风格的法语文段 —— 来自化学、哲学和人类行为观察领域一放在一起看，表达的意思很明显。尽管每个人都有理性，但每个人的理性都会因为自我欺骗和个人利益而受到损害。古典思想在于通过自律避免这些弱点，同时还要避免为此沾沾自喜。这当然不可能。

选段 5-6

自我，不可能逃脱，但可以，通过才智和努力，转移对它的注意力。

—— 唐纳德·巴塞尔姆，《杜米埃》16

古典风格表达某种完整的性情只用了一句话。不喜欢这种风格的人，认为这种特点狭隘且千篇一律，容易落入俗套或自嘲中；而欣赏这种风格的人，认为它的格言特点与其所表达的思想一致，像某种完整统一的东西。巴塞尔姆的句子不仅是一种陈述或一种观察，还是一种生活态度的表达。它就像一种表达性情的自传的缩影。它的主题对表达的性情很重要 —— 自我，在文中被当作某种笼子。关在笼子里的人自然想出去，但第一个分句明确告诉我们，逃离是不可能的。有意思的是，这种情境引发的不是绝望，也不是被动，而是行动。因为。「通过才智和努力」，自我的受害者，即使无法实现理想目标，也可以实现最迫切的实际目标。这是一个相当惨淡的世界，但正是这个世界，给了你一个意外的理由去重视才智和努力。

这种性情与杰弗逊或笛卡儿表现出来的性情不一样，他们都不是从人类基本潜力的局限开始的。然而，在十七世纪一些著名的法国古典作家中，也可以发现像巴塞尔姆这样退而求其次（resignation）的性情。比如拉罗什福科，他认为人类的基本潜力存在根本的局限性：人不可能没有自知之明，而对他人的认识，如果正确，揭示出来的总是为已谋私的品性。拉罗什福科的箴言「人从来不像自己想象的那么幸福，也并非自己想象的那么不幸」（Onn'est jamais si heureux ni si malheureux quon s'imagine）表达的性情是：面对人类潜力不可改变的局限，我们只能听之任之。

巴塞尔姆的思想整体上是一种向目标运动的图式结构，有两次冲动：先前往理想目标但没成功 —— 标志着不可能实现 —— 再换成前往替代目标。第一次冲动是欲望，第二次冲动是接受。第二次冲动到达预期目标之前被中断，没想到这个可实现的次级目标要求的条件也相当因难。

这句话模仿了它要表达的思想的图式结构：它直接前往的目标（逃脱）被否定了，又从这个被否定的目标前往有可能到达的目标（转移注意力）。根据语法规则，「can be」（可以）后面应该紧邻过去分词「be distracted」（转移对它的注意力）。

但是这句话在语法上用了意想不到的迂回，在过去分词前面插了一个插入语。这种语法迂回创造了一种转移注意力的效果，这正是句子末尾所指的目标。

把插入语「通过才智和努力」（with ingenuity and hard work）插到最后一个动词短语「可以转移（对它的）注意力」（can be distracted）之中，破坏了基础句子的对称性：「自我不可能逃脱，但可以转移对它的注意力（Th self cannot be escaped, but it can be distracted）。」这个细微变化暗示逃避的幻象和转移注意力的辛苦这两者截然不同。逃脱，因为不可能做到，没有附属条件。转移注意力，属于不同类型的事物，不像幻想那样渴望，也不像幻想那样简单。

在古典风格看来，真相的结构是它的意义的一部分，而且很可能在它的表达中沿袭下来。这种沿袭为表达结构赋予了意义一两个语法对等的表达，包含的意思不同。我们看看下面的两种表达。

自我不可能逃脱，但可以，通过才智和努力，转移对它的注意力。

[The self cannot be escaped, but it can be, with ingenuity and hard work, distracted.]

自我不可能逃脱，但通过才智和务力，可以转移对它的注意力。

[The self cannot be escaped, but with ingenuity and hard work it can be distracted.]

第一种表达的图示结构：前往目标时有脱轨、延误、干扰和辛苦。它从它要表达的思想中沿袭了这种结构。第二种表达没有这样的图式结构。两种表达的差异微乎其微，但不可忽视。

古典风格非常注重细节，因此对表达的图式结构很用心。古典风格认为，细微差异不是随意为之，也不是为了装饰；它就是意义本身。只有严格要求和精益求精，才能看出细微差异，稍有马虎就很难注意到。细微差异是古典风格的精髓。不论多么细微，这些细节的意义是绝对的。两件看似几乎一样的东西，实际上不同，而古典风格专门用来呈现这些细致敏锐的差别。

古典表达呈现最简单、准确的分析结果。前提是分析已经完成，它只需用最简单准确的形式表达结果。思想会找到确切的差异、确切的关系、确切的事物和形式，表达只用把这系列的分析呈现出来。表达如真相一样清晰简单，但不能更清晰、更简单了。巴塞尔姆的句子是古典风格，在于它表达了精准的分析。句子清晰简单，却也呈现出了想要传达的思想中必不可少的细微差异。

不露声色

选段 5-7

他们槽践了你，你的爸妈。也许不是有意，但事实如此。

—— 菲利普·拉金，《高窗》① 17

① 此处参考舒丹丹的翻译，根据本书作者讨论的用词差异调整了「fuck」和「mum and dad」的翻译。原翻译为：他们搞槽了你，你妈咪和爹地。也许不是有意，但事实如此。—— 译者注







这两句话在这里排列成散文，是一首十二行诗的前两行。虽然拉金使用了传统诗歌的韵律和节奏，但他赋予了他的诗歌说话的声音 —— 随意、即兴、对话感。他最好的诗歌不仅向古典风格散文看齐，而且具备了古典散文的条件。

他的第一句话，「他们槽践了你，你的爸妈」听起来像是一边对话一边观察；这些词似乎与它们要表达的思想一样平淡无奇，它们说的是陈词滥调，但有一种不经意的新颖。这种观察萃取了大量个人经验历史，而不是抽取其中一个案例。读者可以直接参照自己的经验验证真相。

他的第二句话，「也许不是有意，但事实如此」，听起来像是补充的想法。实际上，这是作者无形中做好了所有工作。不像拉罗什福科、萧伯纳或王尔德这些古典作家，拉金故意避免显露自己的才华，而是尽可能地隐藏他的才能和努力 —— 如果读得不仔细，就可能认识不到。但这些词句是作者做了很多无形工作之后精心呈现出来的。试试别的表达比如，「你的爸妈槽践了你，即使他们不是有意」—— 可以看到本来犀利的短句变得多么平淡无奇。

如果细细体味拉金的用词，我们可以看出来这段话虽然表面上很随意，但实际上有多么细致和考究。稍想一想就能发现，「你的爸妈」（your mum and dad）和「你的父亲母亲」（your mother and father）、「你的爸爸妈妈」（your mommy and daddy）或「你的爸妈」（your dad and mum）是不一样的效果。「爸妈」是对父母的常见称呼，因为对他们的孩子来说，他们充当着特定的角色。母语为英语的人，尤其是说英式英语的人，确切地知道什么时候什么场景用这个称呼，但这个称呼有大量的变体。拉金在文中称呼父母的词非常完美，因为父母正是以「你的爸妈」身份「槽践了你」。拉金的语言用了一个完美的词汇萃取出这种极其复杂却又寻常的经历 —— 父母也不是不称职，但常常不出所料不可避免地让孩子变得更槽。「也许不是有意，但事实如此」。

脏话几乎不会出现在古典文章中，恰恰因为说脏话的事由通常不是古典风格。它很少能正确地呈现，反而常常让观察更模糊不清。不正式的「爸妈」和粗俗的「糟践了你」，在这段话中特别贴合主题。表达本身虽然显得很普通，用词低调，但令人难忘，且不容置疑，由文化孕育，自然也能由文化证实。

选段 5-8

西奥多·德莱塞的小说，马克思主义的政治修辞，新泽西州北部的景观，机场的纪念品商店 —— 这些都有一种丑陋的特质，虽然能很快融入自身，细节也各不相同，但必然会没完没了地持续下去。

—— 罗伯特·马丁·亚当斯，《说人坏话》18

谢弗勒兹夫人光芒四射，集智慧、抱负和美丽于一身：地风情万千、活波大胆、勇于开拓：地动用她全部的魅力，争取把事情办成功，在这过程中她几乎总是给那些地碰到的人带来灾难。

—— 拉罗什福科，《回忆录》19

当拉罗什福科写谢弗勒滋夫人时，西奥多·德菜塞还没有写小说，马克思主义改治修辞还未出现，新泽西州北部的景观还未被英国教授开发出来，机场里还没有纪念品商店，也不存在机场。他和罗伯特·马丁·亚当斯各自受某种知识环境影响，但他们生活的社会不同，谈论的事情不同。尽管如此，他们的观察有很多共同的地方 —— 如果我们不考虑他们说的内容只看他们怎么组织语言。

他们每个人都在精心盘算着一个点，从一开始就已经知道这个点，但为了水到渠成地达到它最大的效果，一直在做预备和准备工作。因为对自己谈论的话题有丰富的经验，他们每个人都表现出一副自信十足的姿态。他的判断无可辩驳，那些忍不住质疑的念头通常都会被打消，因为他们不会因言过其实而显得焦虑不安。亚当斯表示他不仅熟悉这种丑质，还熟悉其他种类的丑陋时，消除了读者的疑患。就好像不存在这些事物是否丑陋的疑问：他只关心他对它们的丑陋类别是否归属正确。

从拉罗什福科的话中我们可以看出，他认识很多女性，其中一些人很有魅力，另一些人很有才华或很有抱负，但是没有一个人像谢弗勒兹夫人那样。拉罗什福科和亚当斯都是从一个安全的话题讲起。亚当斯描绘的永恒无望的丑陋没有威胁到他自己；拉罗什福科也不会参与到谢弗勒兹夫人的任何项目当中。他们的安全处境，表明他们没有迫切的利益企图，没有急于让读者相信他们所说的话，这种隐含的主张，也体现在句子本身的结构和语气当中。

亚当斯的句子有一种沉思的语气，当然他并非不加选择地写下任何类型的丑陋。拉罗什福科也不急于否定谢弗勒兹夫人；他的描述中有一种欣赏和公正的语气。虽然事实证明接触这个女人很危险，但是这丝毫不减她的魅力，这些魅力不仅丰富多彩，而且很少在同一个人身上出现。想想看，如果拉罗什福科这样写，效果会有多不同：「尽管谢弗勒兹夫人美丽、聪慧…...」。

这些句子没有表达任何疑问，做出的肯定且不加掩饰的判断可能会引起读者质疑，但他们平静而沉着的判断和对细微差异的表达，打消了读者质疑的念头。这种差异不是随意写的；它们是作者思考、观察和验证的结果 —— 像某种调查研究。但这种努力不会反映在表达上；就连写作本身也要听起来很容易。两位作者都没有暗示，他们要设想某些方式消除读者质疑的冲动，虽然他们已经预想过问题，也想出了应对之策。

虽然都仔细斟酌过每个单词的用法和位置，但写完的句子像是即兴的说话。细细思考才会意识到，要即兴说出这么复杂又完美的句子是多么难（两个句子不论怎么改只会改得更差）。两位作家都不想让人察觉到他们付出的努力。这就是为什么要煞费苦心才能让写作看起来跟说话一样：因为写作意味着努力和刻意，有说服力的写作意味着策路。让写作模仿讲话需要做很多努力，出口成章、恰到好处且听起来事实就是如此，可以发生在对话中一常常是正题之前已经说了很多不妥帖的话，大家忘了而已。

因为所有这些共有的特征，所以这些句子在风格上看起来很相似，尽管它们说的不是同一个主题，甚至用的不是同一种语言。

选段 5-9

一座棚栩如生的休伊·朗英雄雕像立在美国国会大厦墓地上方的高座上。他不拘、庞大、年轻的脸庞面向一座大楼，共三十四层，是他花了一年多一点的时间建成的，大部分是联邦政府授入的资金。那件青铜双排扣央克，紧紧地裹住他隆起的肚皮，有着那个时代着装的尊严，像穿着林肯的双排扣长礼服大衣。黄铜雕像的休伊，看起来跟什维尔和纳什维尔、南本德和托皮卡的滑稽佬一样，他们喜欢出没在二十年代术三十年代初一些非法经营的昂贵酒馆里。他看上去像一个边打高尔夫边说黄段子的男人，渴望每个遇到的人的夸赞。看到他立在那里，让我感到悲伤，感到自己老了。他的脚下有一座大理石做的飞马浮雕，刻有一行字，「分享我们的财富」。那是休伊·朗的一句口号，另外一句是「人人都是国王」。

—— A. J. 李伯龄，《路易斯安那公爵》20

在这最后一章，我想观察和追溯美国非洲主义的演变史：从它简单但令人生畏的目的即建立等级差异开始，到它失去这种差异后自我反思的替代性能，再到它在恐惧和欲望的修辞中欣欣向荣的存在。

—— 托妮·莫里森，《在黑暗中游戏：白人性与文学想象》21

克里斯托弗·莱曼-豪普特（Christopher Lehmann-Haupt）在《纽约时报》中评论托妮·莫里森《在黑暗中游戏》和她的小说《爵士乐》时，引用了这句话说明她的文章风格，并把这篇的风格与他称为莫里森的小说之诗进行了对比。他不认同「她用来表达她的观点的风格」22 这句话。他有一个默认的、传统的假设，几乎是新闻界通行的做法，即风格与思想完全分离。所以莫里森应该以更容易理解的方式呈现她的想法。正是基于这一假设，许多修改文章的做法都是最后抖一抖文章的表面，以为可以把污点和瑕疵抖落干净。

莫里森的句子难以理解，不在于它的表面，而在于它的思想。句子的意象图式结构 —— 沿着一条路径从一个位置移向另一个位置的空间移动 —— 是基本的古典特征。下面这句一看就懂的话就是根据那种意象图式写出来的：

我想观察和追溯基督教的历史，看它是怎么从犹太教的异端，发展成为古罗马帝国的国教，再演变成中世纪欧洲的主流宗教的。

这个意象图式融合了一个基本隐喻：思想、信仰和制度 —— 都不是实物，也不能移动 —— 但可以通过隐喻将它理解为可移动的实物。不同国家是比喻意义上的不同位置；演变过程是从一个位置移向另一个位置的隐喻。人们可以「追溯」某观念、信念或制度的历史 —— 从视觉上的「追踪」其历史时期的「运动」所「沿循」的「路径」。莫里森的句子和这个描述基督教的句子，同样是建立在隐喻和意象图式相结合的基础上的。但是这句描述基督教的话一读就懂，而莫里森的句子令人相当费解。两者的差异体现在对主题的构想上。

无论具体的主题还是抽象的主题，在古典风格中都会被构想为大家能看到的「事物」，各个层面都清晰明了 —— 从结构到细节。任何有能力的观察者看到后，都会承认这种文化「事物」。它的存在独立于作者的构想，当然也独立于作者的文章。二个主题，通过这种方式被构想为「事物」，既契合空间运动的意象图式，也契合将变化比作空间位移的隐喻。

即使读者无法准确描述基督教，甚至也许只能勉强将它与佛教区分开来，但《纽约时报》的大多数读者都会承认 —— 当然也包括克里斯托弗·菜曼-豪普特 —— 人们可以观察基督教，就像可以观察巴吞鲁日国会大厦里的休伊·明的雕像一样。和基督教不一样，「美国非洲主义」因为自身的抽象而吸引注意力，正是因为它没有一个普遍认可的边界 —— 无论一个概念多么不确定都需要这样的边界，有了边界，才能从只有特殊读者理解的特殊观念变为日常谈论的通俗观念，在修辞目的上和可追溯轨迹的行星一样没有区别。

美国非洲主义历史的三个阶段同样很准理解，所有这些都是陌生的抽象概念，在当代美国文化中还未得到普及。「中世纪欧洲」也是一个抽象的概念，但大家基本都知道；即使《纽约时报》的读者对中世纪欧洲完全没有概念，他们也可以认为这种抽象概念是确定且合理的，因为这类读者相信他可以自己查到。「恐惧和欲望的修辞」还没有这种普及程度，所以，美国非洲主义在恐惧和欲望的修辞中欣欣向荣的存在不能理所当然地被接受。

莫里森的描述难以理解并不是因为偶然因素，不是换「另一种语言风格」即更容易理解的语言就能被理解了。她谈论的是一些还没有普及的特殊概念，这些概念无法独立于她的思想而存在。因此，在这段话中，作者和读者之间的不对等关系说明她的风格不是古典风格。假如一位作者是以古典风格呈现这样一个主题，要想追溯它的运动轨迹，就得先分析出美国非洲主义这个事实的具体细节，让读者能当作一件他可以体验的「事物」来理解。要用读者不易察觉的方式把实际的说服场景换成典型场景，而古典风格作者还得说服他的读者相信，他可以用理解金星的方式理解美国非洲主义，像一个天文学家追溯金星轨迹一样追溯美国非洲主义的发展路径。主题的抽象性质并不妨碍作者构建这样一个概念：像夏斯岱尔记录文化历史一样，像弗里德伦德尔鉴赏古画一样，像多德翻译新约一样，像费曼研究数学物理一样，像拉法耶特夫人观察情感一样，像塞维涅夫人观察社会一样，呈现最抽象的领域里最抽象的事物，就好像在谈论雕像、草莓或昏星一样。

第一眼就能看出来，李伯龄描述休伊·朗的雕像的话可能与托妮·莫里森的那段话没有任何共同之处。莫里森谈的是抽象的文化现象和它的发展顺序；李伯龄谈的是任何人站在休伊·朗的坟墓前都能看到的静态雕像。把两段话放在一起，看起来好像验证了众多写作指南的建议：「要表现具体，避免抽象」。当然，无论思维还是写作都无法避免使用抽象事物，所以像大多数毫无针对性的建议一样，「要表现具体，避免抽象」这条准则很难用于实践。不过这条准则与风格上的合理观察至少有那么一点点关系，就像「你无法确定任何事情」这句话与海森堡的不确定性原理的关系。

李伯龄描述的休伊·朗的雕像，依据的是二十世纪二三十年代的美国文化，这种文化概念跟莫里森笔下的文章一样抽象，至少对李伯龄来说是个人想法，就像莫里森说的美国非洲主义运动对她来说也是个人想法。两者在风格上的差异体现在他们阐述抽象概念的方式上。莫里森说的美国非洲主义很难代入进去，因为莫里森没有把她描述的主题当作一种任何人都可以验证的「事物」。因此，她的概念的抽象性质更为突出，她留给读者的选择是，要么认同她说的或她思考的，要么多多少少都会觉得这是一种个人的随意视角。

李伯龄展示了古典风格的一种典型过渡方式，从任何人都可以自己看得到的事物 —— 雕像 —— 到基于抽象文化和道德观念的个人解读。他从没说任何其他人都能看到他这座雕像的文化环境；他把那种环境当作一种理所当然的实物，暗示任何人只要在现场都能描述出最细微的细节。所以仔细分析后才会意识到，虽然任何人都能验证雕像的存在与卷轴上刻的字（分享我们的财富），但如果读者不是把李伯龄的思考当成一种事物，就不会理解他从描述雕像自然过渡到描述卷轴的解读方式。李伯龄知道，要获得认同就得说服读者，但他从未明确承认有说服读者的必要。相反，他解决这个问题用的是一种巧妙的并置和不言自明的保证：他所说的一切（不论是事实还是观点），跟他眼前的事物一样可信 —— 排除偶然的空间因素和时间因素 —— 你也可以在眼前看到。看看「分享我们的财富」与「每个人都是国王」的对比，第一句是刻在卷轴上的口号，而第二句是李伯龄引用的休伊·朗的另一句口号。休伊·朗的墓地上看不到第二句口号，但它是休伊·朗最著名的句子之一。任何人只要查阅相关资料，都能印证李伯龄说的话。把作者的解读当作一种可以通过相关出处验证的事物，只是一个隐形的步骤；不让读者察觉到这段话的相关出处源于作者的想象，是一种古典风格技巧。

When that was once begun, it was as little in my fear, that what words of complaint I heard among lerned men of other parts utter'd against the Inquisition, the same I should hear by as lerned men at home utterd in time of Parlament against an order of licencing; and that so generally, that when I had disclos'd my self a companion of their discontent, I might say, if without envy, that he whom an honest quæstorship had indear'd to the Sicilians, was not more by them importun'd against Verres, then the favourable opinion which I had among many who honour ye, and are known and respected by ye, loaded me with entreaties and perswasions; that I would not despair to lay together that which just reason should bring into my mind, toward the removal of an undeserved thraldom upon lerning.

— John Milton, Areopagitica

This passage, a single sentence of 142 words, is almost impossible to understand at one reading. Although it comes from an essay ostensibly meant to be a speech to Parliament, it does not model itself on speech and distances itself self-consciously from any possible model of conversation. It has no image schema indicating a clear direction or a goal. It is in every way unclassic and offers a striking contrast to the most conspicuous style of French prose contemporary with it.

It would be tempting for any contemporary writing consultant to offer a sort of over-the-counter prescription for improving this sentence if it were not for the fact that it occurs in a major seventeenth-century prose text that has been studied and admired around the world for over three centuries. Such a writing consultant would place a premium on clarity and would suggest effective means of rewriting the entire Areopagitica so as to make it easier to parse. But Milton would have viewed these revisions as a complete destruction of his mature and accomplished style, and he would have been right.

Clarity is a prime virtue within classic style or practical style, and it is easy to begin judging other styles by the standards of one of these general styles, especially for writers who actually use one of them on a regular basis. Classic style, like practical style, encourages such judgments by making a tacit claim to being a universal style. But this claim is deceptive. Neither classic style nor practical style can suit Milton's purposes because his model scene is not the scene essential to either classic or practical style. In this way, this passage resembles Samuel Johnson's opening comments in his「Preface to Shakespeare」: both Milton and Johnson write in mature and consistent styles completely incompatible with either classic or practical style. The model scene behind classic style is conversation, with the result that it tends to come in discrete units, intelligible when excerpted. The model scene behind the Areopagitica requires a display of ostentatiously orchestrated erudition. This scene places the highest premium on gravity and allusion — not on clarity. Far from depending on a model of conversation, it is not even modeled on English speech; it is modeled on written Latin. The influence of Milton's model scene upon his style is such that an excerpted passage may be nearly unintelligible, but there is no reason for Milton to view this as a fault. He does not mean the Areopagitica to live through pithy excerpts, and he most certainly would suffer from using a style that looks as if it is easy to parse or conveniently packaged into easily digested bites. To rewrite the Areopagitica in the style of La Rochefoucauld or A. J. Liebling would be to ensure that the reader Milton is addressing would immediately brand it as trivial.

Socrates in the Apology expresses a touchstone of classic style, as if it were a fundamental priority of all style:「If you hear me defending myself in the same language which it has been my habit to use, both in the open spaces of this city (where many of you have heard me) and elsewhere, do not be surprised.」

He explicitly refuses to adopt the mannered style of the courtroom, and he implies that there is something artificial and dishonest in that style. He adopts as his model scene conversation, voice, spontaneity. As a result, it is easy to excerpt from his speech discrete, intelligible units of discourse. The Apology is, after all, with a very minimum of glossing, perfectly intelligible today in translation to audiences in Oregon or Ohio or Hong Kong, audiences who know absolutely nothing about the conventions of Athenian courtrooms at the beginning of the fourth century B.c.

By contrast, imagine a speech by an Athenian orator whose main goal, unlike Socrates', is to win his case. Contemporary readers in Hong Kong or Ohio cannot, of course, imagine any such thing in detail. The specific good moves in such a speech would go unnoticed or function as barriers to understanding in much the fashion that Milton's elaborate syntax and classical allusions do in the passage from the Areopagitica. It would be impossible to「correct」Milton's style (or the Athenian orator's) without understanding the scene that helps define his style as well as he does. Only a few specialists in seventeenth-century English parliamentary history have any such knowledge today, and it is not obvious that any of them now knows how to address the Parliament that Milton wished to address as well as Milton did himself. No general principle (「Omit needless words,」for example) can ever supersede a specific knowledge of such elements of style as the scene and cast that help define a style, for only they can indicate which words are needless.

While I've indicated to you previously that we may well have, probably do have, enough monetary stimulus in the system to create that [economic recovery], I'm not sure that we will not need some insurance or to revisit this issue, and all I can say to you is that we're all looking at the same set of data, the same economy, the same sense of confidence which pervades it. We're all making our judgments with respect to how that is evolving with respect to economic activity and where the risks of various different actions are. And there will be differences inevitably.

— Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, responding to senators at a congressional hearing, who were trying to get him to cut interest rates in order to speed economic recovery (March 1992)

This passage from Alan Greenspan, as reported by The New York Times of 20 April 1992, is certainly not an example of classic style, but it is a definite style and a cultivated one. Since it is above all a spoken style (meant, however, to be read in newspaper accounts), Mr. Greenspan refers to it as「an incoherent mumble.」Its virtues are just the opposite of classic style's virtues, and performances in this style should not be confused with the speaker's general level of articulateness. It is not a style of obfuscation as it is sometimes claimed to be, for its speaker is not hiding a conclusion or a point that he actually expresses buried in all that confusing verbiage. It is rather a style of gridlock, expressed in a manner that is built around images of contradictory and asymmetrical motion and a shifting kaleidoscope of qualifications. It is not, like classic style, a general style; it is a special style deliberately deployed by the relatively few people in positions like that of the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, whose powers are vast and whose words are carefully studied for hints of what they are likely to do. If the passage is pored over carefully, it gives no hint about whether Greenspan will or will not lower interest rates, whether he has made up his mind on the subject, or even whether he agrees that lowering interest rates will have the effect that the senators think it will have.

For powerful directors of policy forced to testify in public, the virtues of classic style can be disastrous. The protocol of congressional hearings requires that the respondents appear to respect the committee, so people like Alan Greenspan cannot say,「I'm here because I have to be here, but I'm not telling you anything.」The unusual circumstances of this scene require the successful practitioner to give the impression that he or she actually may have said something of substance, and to avoid at all costs inviting any further clarifying questions of an obvious sort. If Greenspan had said,「I think we've already lowered interest rates enough, but we are monitoring the situation continually and it may be that at some point it will make sense to lower them further. I will do what I think is indicated at the appropriate time, and that may not be what you think is indicated,」he would have made his essential points much more clearly, but at an unacceptable cost. It is unwise for him to indicate to the senators in a clear fashion that he will do what he thinks best and will be unaffected by anything they think, nor does he wish clearly to rule out what they suggest since it is against his interests to indicate either that he will or will not lower the interest rates and equally against his interests to give any indication about when he will make up his mind. The hypothetical revision is clearer certainly, but it invites unwelcome questions: Then you have ruled out, for the moment, lowering interest rates? Under what future circumstances will it make sense to lower the rates further? What are you watching as an indicator that the current rates are too high?

All of these questions must be warded off because he really does not wish to give any indication of his future course of action. Various markets would react to any hint he may give of what he is likely to do. In the circumstances,「While I've indicated to you previously that we may well have, probably do have, enough monetary stimulus in the system to create that . . .」is in every way superior to「I think we've already lowered interest rates enough.」The statement is so filled with qualifications and so indefinite even with respect to its effective date or what it is talking about that it says absolutely nothing about what he may do while seeming to offer a concession.「While I said x at some point in the past,」leads the audience to expect「I say y now.」That is not the actual sequence, and what does follow is so much at odds with what is expected, and so entirely shapeless, that it is not immediately clear that there is actually no concession. Everything is done to leave doubt on later analysis even that he still thinks enough has been done now「to create that」(create what? the exasperated reader says), since the whole phrase is framed by「I've indicated to you previously,」and does not offer the expected symmetrical statement about what the speaker is indicating now. Greenspan uses subtle verbal resources to avoid the unhedged present indicative and to erase any momentary appearance of stable assertion: modals, ambiguous reference, adverbs of doubt, locations of events in an indefinite future or an indefinite ongoing present.

This passage and a consideration of the special requirements of its exceptional scene can serve as a reminder first, that what is a vice in one style can be a virtue in another and second, that there are not merely two styles, good and bad, but many styles, some general, some highly specialized. Almost any English composition teacher would say that this passage「needs revision,」and may go on to suggest what is wrong with it. In fact, there is nothing wrong with it. It is a virtuoso performance of stonewalling disguised as incoherence. There is nothing sloppy about it. It is not unplanned. It is deliberate in its contradiction of the expected symmetrical and directional image schema whose expectations it frustrates with exquisite skill. It is a performance as precise as a cat's walking though a chaos of objects on a messy desk without disturbing any of them.

This memorandum . . . deals with what might be called the least important questions confronting authors and publishers. But it is precisely because of their relative unimportance, despite their capacity for mischief-making, that we should be able to take them in our stride. The effort, in other words, is to remove them from the problem category so that we can devote our energy to matters of larger significance — authors and editors to intelligent and imaginative control of fact and expression, designers and compositors to efficient and artistic typesetting, proofreaders to rapid and precise detection of inaccuracies.

Although there are some matters of comma style (for instance, restrictive vs. nonrestrictive clauses) so well established in custom as to have become rules, nearly all are merely matters of taste. We prefer a comma before the conjunction in a series (「red, white, and blue」), and also after「i.e.」and「e.g.」

— 「Memorandum for Authors, Editors, Compositors, Proofreaders on the Preparation of Manuscripts and the Handling of Proof,」Princeton University Press, January 1990

English orthography satisfies all the requirements of the canons of reputability under the law of conspicuous waste. It is archaic, cumbrous, and ineffective; its acquisition consumes much time and effort; failure to acquire it is easy of detection.

— Thorstein Veblen, The Theory of the Leisure Class

The attitude of the memorandum from Princeton University Press might come as a surprise to readers of the guides and handbooks used in English composition courses, where questions of capitalization, spelling, punctuation, and usage seem to constitute not just the most conspicuous surface aspects of writing but practically the whole subject. The reason for this common misordering of priorities is precisely the conspicuous nature of these accidentals. That is why Thorstein Veblen suggested in a classic work of sociology that spelling is meant to indicate a form of social distinction based on the leisure to learn an arbitrary and inefficient system. Such things as the pronunciation and spelling of place names often serve as a marker distinguishing the local population from outsiders. A distinguished American theologian who pulled off a highway to ask directions to Beloit, which he pronounced in the French manner (bell-wah), was quickly informed, once the laughter died down,「Beh-LOIT, buddy. You're in Wisconsin now.」

Accidentals hardly enter into the elements of style at all, but they can cause any amount of mischief unless they are well managed because they indicate the writer's knowledge of etiquette and protocol. The idea that dictionaries and handbooks control these questions is a common misunderstanding. Dictionaries and handbooks try as hard as they can to keep up with the practice of a vaguely defined set of speakers who together determine prevailing limits of taste in such matters. Dictionary editors are in the same position as individuals who do not wish to be conspicuous in the wrong way. But unlike many of these individuals, the editors understand that they are observing a contest in social influence, not recording — much less defining — a correct position.

In Lulu in Hollywood, Louise Brooks, who must be the best writer among all the sex symbols of the silent screen, explains that she became painfully aware of her Kansas accent because it made her sound provincial in New York. She encountered a Columbia University student at the soda fountain of a drugstore she frequented and flattered him into becoming her speech teacher. In her own words,

「Mulk」became「milk,」and「kee-yow」became「cow.」Then:「Not ‘watter' as in ‘hotter' but ‘water' as in ‘daughter.' And it's not ‘hep,' you hayseed — it's ‘help,' ‘help,' ‘help'!」Within a month of fudge sundaes, this boy had picked his way through my vocabulary, eliminating the last trace of my hated Kansas accent. From the start, it had been my intention not to exchange one label for another. I didn't want to speak the affected London stage-English of the high-comedy stars, like Ina Claire and ruth chatterton; I wanted to speak clean, unlabeled English. My soda jerk spoke clean, unlabeled English.

Louise Brooks was no doubt right to think that in New York in the 1920s a femme fatale could not go around saying「kee-yow」instead of「cow,」but consider how wrong she is to think that she had acquired「unlabeled」English. She had merely dropped an unfashionable label for one that was more suitable to the image she sought to project. Even if we leave her native Kansas out of the question, how would her New York soda jerk's「clean, unlabeled English」sound in Baton Rouge, Louisiana? Fort Worth, Texas? Chicago, Illinois? Or even across the bridge in Brooklyn?

The same social principle applies to many conspicuous aspects of language, none of which determines style. Consider the disappearance of the word「Negro」from contemporary American usage and the currently tenuous position of its successor,「black.」At what point was「Negro」archaic usage and who decided the question? Certainly not American dictionaries. They merely surveyed current usage until they determined that the change had become general. The same phenomenon is going on today with the term「black,」which itself may soon become archaic in general usage to be replaced by either「Afro-American」or「African American.」The competition between these two terms will be decided by how quickly one of them is generally adopted.

All such competitions induce anxiety in many writers and speakers because the「wrong」choice can make a speaker or writer look ridiculous. For this reason there is always a market for self-proclaimed language gurus, and every bookstore has a shelf of etiquette books that pretend all these questions are settled, although inevitably these books often disagree with one another. Publishers and their technical staffs are under no illusions; they know there is no authority outside of the social hierarchy of native speakers and writers. They also know that while accidentals can cause mischief, no degree of mere correctness can possibly constitute a style and too much anxiety about accidentals can compromise one. There were plenty of actresses in the 1920s who never had to substitute「cow」for「kee-yow,」but none of them projected the image that Louise Brooks did. She would have ruined that image, moreover, had she betrayed anxiety about getting it right.

Misunderstandings on this subject sometimes extend to people who have exceptional power to influence usage. The New York Times and The Washington Post gave coverage to Thurgood Marshall's decision to use the term「Afro-American」in a written opinion he filed in 1989 as an associate justice of the United States Supreme court.

First the eminent jurist explained his motives:「I spent most of my life fighting to get Negro spelled with a capital N. . . . Then people started saying black and I never liked it.」

Then he revealed how greatly he underrated his own authority:「Justice Marshall said he chose Afro-American rather than African American, now gaining currency, because ‘Afro-American is in the dictionary and the other one isn't.'「

Montaigne déjà avait trouvé en sa Gascogne et dans sa tour de Montaigne, un style de génie, mais tout individuel et qui ne tirait pas à conséquence. Pascal a trouvé un style à la fois individuel, de génie, qui a sa marque et que nul ne peut lui prendre, et un style aussi de forme générale, logique et régulière, qui fait loi, et auquel tous peuvent et doivent plus ou moins se rapporter: il a établi la prose française.

[Montaigne already had found in his Gascony and in his tower at Montaigne a style of genius, but a completely individual one that drew no followers. Pascal discovered a style at once individual, marked by genius, completely his own, that no one could take from him, and yet a general style, logical and regular, with the force of law, one that everyone can and should more or less adopt as a standard: he established French prose.]

— Sainte-Beuve, Port-Royal

Classic style, in the hands of its master practitioners, can be distinctive without appearing to be personal. Its implicit claim is that it does not depend upon the writer's personality for its effects. Sainte-Beuve points to this feature of classic style in comparing two great French writers, Montaigne and Pascal.

It was, of course, the French educational bureaucracy in the nineteenth century that made Pascal's style something like「law」and decided that he had not merely demonstrated the powers of a style but「established French prose.」Still, the apparent paradox — the claim that Pascal's style is individual yet available to everyone and even more or less obligatory — is a consequence of the classic stand on truth, presentation, scene, cast, thought and language. Pascal is a reasonable model for pedagogical purposes precisely because his style is a general one. While no student is likely to achieve Pascal's level of mastery, the great usefulness of his style as a model is precisely that it is possible for almost anyone to achieve a working competence without needing either Pascal's exceptional abilities or his exceptional passion and sense of purpose. What is personal to him lies outside the style, for his principal achievement, on this view, is more in the nature of a discovery about writing than a written expression of his own thought. Classic style disavows superior powers of introspection or exceptional personal insight or exceptional personal commitment; it never abandons the implicit claim to be merely presenting what the reader, once properly situated, can verify. Its seventeenth-century French practitioners employed the style in a variety of literary forms: in personal correspondence, in books of maxims and moral portraits, in at least one notable work of fiction, and in the memoir literature that is a feature of seventeenth-century French prose. The memoirs of both La Rochefoucauld and his rival, the Cardinal de Retz, share all the essential marks of the style. While their observations are unmistakably their own, they never ask the reader to accept what they say on the strength of something that can belong only to them. Like all classic writers, they do all the work, they do it invisibly, and they suggest that, accidents of opportunity aside, the reader could do precisely what they are doing. As one nineteenth-century editor of Retz put it,

[L]a langue n'était évidemment pour lui [Retz] qu'un moyen de rendre sa pensée, ou plutôt de présenter habilement, sous un certain jour, les hommes, les événements, et en particulier ses propres actions.

[Language is evidently for him {Retz} only a way of presenting his thought, or better of ably presenting, on any given day, people, events, and especially his own actions.]

Dem schreibenden Herzog bietet sich die Erinnerung an Menschen und Auftritte mit so drängender Gewalt und so viel Fülle des Einzelnen, daß seine Feder kaum mit zukommen scheint, und er ist offenbar vollkommen uberzeugt, daß alles, was ihm einfällt, für das Ganze unentberhrlich ist und sich auch ins Ganze einordnen wird, ohne daß er im voraus dafür Sorge tragen muß.

[As Saint-Simon writes, memories of people and scenes come to him so urgently and with such an abundance of details that his pen seems hardly able to keep up with it all; and he is apparently quite convinced that everything that occurs to him is indispensable for the whole and that it will find its proper place there without his having to prepare for it in advance.]

— Erich Auerbach, Mimesis

Je le voyais bec à bec entre deux bougies, n'y ayant du tout que la largeur de la table entre deux. J'ai décrit ailleurs son horrible physionomie. Eperdu tout à coup par l'ouïe et par la vue, je fus saisi, tandis qu'il parlait, de ce que c'était qu'un jésuite, qui, par son néant personnel et avoué, ne pouvait rien espérer pour sa famille, ni, par son état et par ses vœux, pour soi-même, pas même une pomme ni un coup de vin plus que les autres; qui par son âge touchait au moment de rendre compte à Dieu, et qui, de propos délibéré et amené avec grand artifice, allait mettre l'Etat et la religion dans la plus terrible combustion, et ouvrir la persécution la plus affreuse pour des questions qui ne lui faisaient rien, et qui ne touchaient que l'honneur de leur école de Molina. Ses profondeurs, les violences qu'il me montra, tout cela me jeta en un tel (sic) extase, que tout à coup je me pris à lui dire en l'interrompant:「Mon Père, quel âge avez-vous?」Son extrême surprise, car je le regardais de tous mes yeux, qui la virent se peindre sur son visage, rappela mes sens. . . . [I saw him face to face between two candles, having nothing but the width of the table between the two of us. I have elsewhere described his horrible physiognomy. Bewildered suddenly by hearing and sight, I was seized, while he talked, with what a Jesuit was, who, through his personal and avowed nothingness, could hope nothing for his family, nor, through his condition and his vows, for himself, not even an apple or a drink of wine more than the others; who, through his age, was close to the moment of rendering his account to God, and who, of deliberate purpose, and brought about with great artifice, was going to put the State and religion into the most terrible combustion, and inaugurate the most frightful persecution for questions which meant nothing to him and which affected only the honor of their school of Molina. His depths, the violences which he showed me, all this threw me into such an ecstasy that I suddenly found myself saying, interrupting him:「Father, how old are you?」His extreme surprise, for I was looking at him with all my eyes, which saw it painted on his face, called back my senses. . . .]

— Saint-Simon, as quoted in Erich Auerbach, Mimesis

In Mimesis, the Romance philologist Erich Auerbach offers a series of virtuoso stylistic analyses of the type known as explication de texte. The passages he has selected are arranged in a chronological sequence beginning with Homer and the sacred scripture of ancient Israel and ending with selections from Virginia Woolf and Marcel Proust. In keeping with the subject of his book, whose subtitle in its English translation is「The Representation of Reality in Western Literature,」the sequence of passages he discusses is conceived as an evolutionary progress of representational styles that depend increasingly for their effects on an evident asymmetry between writer and reader in their model cast. Here the classic style of Retz and Pascal is seen as formulaic and superficial compared with the next element of the sequence — the inimitably idiosyncratic performance of Saint-Simon, whose representations of individuals at the court of Louis XIV are incomparable not merely for their individuality and complexity but also for the drama of the writer's performance. Saint-Simon's prose is not a window but something like an acrobat's high wire, a platform for fantastic feats obviously beyond the reader's competence and just barely within the writer's. The writer is not so much competent as he is pushing the limits of his art, his language repeatedly tottering on the edge of syntactic incoherence but frequently achieving striking results that have the air of being part inspired genius, part happy accident.

Auerbach's claims for Saint-Simon are grounded in a conviction that the truth of human existence is very far from clear and simple; it is rather unknown and unknowable to any one individual, but reveals itself in historical processes, the dialectic counterpart of the individual projects that, seen as a sequence, unwittingly and progressively reveal what we know of human truth.

When historical particulars are seen not in the classic perspective as occasions for the revelation of eternal truth but rather in this romantic perspective as moments in the unfolding of a truth progressively revealed in history, classic style of presentation can be compared unfavorably to romantic styles of representation. This is exactly what Auerbach does.

His comparison of classic and romantic styles predictably reverses classic values. Its opening note is the preference for inspiration over rational order: the unpredictable insight that occurs in the very act of composition is preferred to the classic pattern of thought preceding speech. For a romantic like Auerbach, deliberate thought as a principle of expression guarantees a superficial and false vision; inspiration in the course of writing is a badge of authenticity and truth:「Everything that occurs to [Saint-Simon] in connection with his subject, he throws into his sentences just as it happens to come to mind, in full confidence that it will somehow fit together in unity and clearness.」For Auerbach, it is not a demerit that Saint-Simon may not see this unity and clearness, that he may merely serve as an inspired conduit to make it available to a future reader.

Classic style values the order of rational analysis as being reliable and not idiosyncratic; it distrusts the order of sensation and emotion as being unreliable, idiosyncratic, and often demonstrably wrong. Auerbach inverts this scale of values:

Saint-Simon obtains his most profound insights not by rationally analyzing ideas and problems but by an empiricism applied to whatever sensory phenomenon happens to confront him and pursued to the point of penetrating to the existential. In contrast (to mention an obvious example) the Jesuit priest of the first [of Pascal's] Lettres provinciales was quite clearly stylized on the basis of a preceding rational study.

This preference for following sensation as it brings unpredictable glimpses of truth is sensible on the romantic view that truth is elusive and never to be seen whole. If truth will not sit still for rational analysis, but comes only in suggestive fragmentary vision, then the writer must always write in fear that at any second whatever fragments of it have come to him will slip away. This intermittent and unpredictable pulse of revelation produces a romantic urgency to capture both the sensation and what it may suggest. This model is unthinkable in classic style, since truth is fully visible to any competent person and cannot slip away. Classic truth can never evaporate. As a result, classic presentation is characterized by calm and ease — a calm and ease that for Auerbach is a hallmark of complacency and self-deception.

[T]he urgency of an inner impulse gives [Saint-Simon's] language something unusual, at times something violent and immoderately expressive, which runs counter to the ease and pleasantness which appealed to the taste of the time.

Auerbach conceives of the truth of human nature as consisting of「profondeurs opaques」: perception of truth will necessarily come in exceptional fragments at exceptional moments to exceptional people. It will come when the observer does not expect it. Saint-Simon, for example, in the middle of a conversation with the Jesuit, Père Tellier, is seized, according to Auerbach, by a revelation of「the essential nature of any strictly organized solidaritarian community.」This conception of truth is of course entirely foreign to classic style. On Auerbach's view, it is a sign of integrity for a writer to present fragments of opaque profundities incompletely perceived as they offer themselves to the individual genius. On the classic view, such a presentation can only be definitive proof of failure. In classic style, the expression is a presentation of the result of thought. Writing that does not meet this description is incompetent by classic standards, but superior for Auerbach:

The non-fictitious, non-precogitated quality of his material, its being drawn from immediate appearances, gives Saint-Simon a depth of life which even the great decades' most important portrayers of character, Molière for example or La Bruyère, could not achieve.

In the classic view, this judgment is simply unintelligible because the evidence offered to support the claim seems to be evidence against it. This judgment has, in the classic view, the same logic as「Guesses are better than accurate knowledge because they are more personal.」

Individual genius as Auerbach describes it consists of fragmentary and unpredictable visions. The writer cannot control them. Anything that can be controlled in a rational fashion is superficial artifice, not profound truth. Genius is charismatic — blessed with prophetic, inspirational moments of vision, much as E. B. White was momentarily blessed with a glimpse into the nature of time as he recorded his impressions of the girl riding her horse around the circus ring. Neither Saint-Simon nor E. B. White can count on such revelations. They may never come to these writers again; they may never come to the reader at all. What is virtue for Auerbach is egoistical delusion for classic style.

Jane Austen's unforgettable presentation of Mr. Collins in Pride and Prejudice — regular and deliberate as it is — will inevitably appear to be on Auerbach's scale of values facile and superficial.

Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful acquaintance. The subjection in which his father had brought him up, had given him originally great humility of manner, but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness, mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a clergyman, and his rights as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.

From the classic perspective, the virtue of Jane Austen's presentation is that once she has shown you where to look, her appraisal of Mr. Collins can be independently「verified」by any reader (just as it is by her characters). Saint-Simon gives a virtuoso presentation of Père Tellier and recounts his insight into the nature of the Jesuits, but while someone else might be able to verify Saint-Simon's presentation of the Jesuit of horrible physiognomy, no one else could follow the route from the physical description of one Jesuit to the revelation of the essential nature of the order. This route from the impression of one individual to a presumed knowledge of a whole community is precisely what Jane Austen means by「prejudice.」Pride and Prejudice turns on the representation of Elizabeth Bennet's repentance for having followed this route to self-deception. What is revelation in Saint-Simon is prejudice in Jane Austen.

Mimesis is a fable about the evolutionary history of style in which later steps in the process are necessarily superior to earlier steps. It is possible for Auerbach to see a particular writer such as Saint-Simon as an almost miraculous mutation exhibiting the shape of the future:「In his level of style, Saint-Simon is a precursor of modern and ultra-modern forms of conceiving and representing life.」Truth, for Auerbach, is not the property of an individual, indeed not essentially available to individuals: it resides in dialectical process — the historicist actions of epochs rather than the historical actions of individuals. The value of the individual writer consists in his degree of participation in that dialectical process. The individual genius of a great writer, then, consists in his seeing through immediate persons and events to the truth of the evolutionary historicist progression. Saint-Simon's excellence consists exactly in his being the first to glimpse a higher stage of epochal truth, as Auerbach remarks in his analysis of Saint-Simon's presentation of the duchesse de Lorge:

We must wait until the late nineteenth century and indeed actually until the twentieth, before we again find in European literature a similar level of tone, a synthesis of a human being which is so entirely free from traditional harmonizing, which presses so unswervingly on from the random data of the phenomenon itself to the ultimate depths of existence.

On such a view, it is possible for Auerbach to place agency in epochs and their sequence rather than in individuals; to write, for example, of the「ease and pleasantness that appealed to the taste of the time,」as if times have tastes, rather than individuals. In Auerbach's formulation, an earlier taste is necessarily a less adequate taste. Although earlier tastes may survive into the future to be contemporary with later tastes, they will occupy lower levels on the historicist Great Chain of Adequacy. Auerbach implies that, luckily, the taste for ease and pleasantness lies now in our evolutionary past; it is nearly unimaginable for us now — who live higher on the evolutionary scale of style — to understand the tastes that previous styles created.

Since Auerbach's measure of stylistic maturity values writing to the extent that it penetrates through local and individual human purpose to historicist truth, he naturally discounts the individual purposes of writers as impediments to the representation of truth. The more a writer includes and the less he selects according to his own purpose, the more likely it is that his writing will touch upon those truths that are essentially beyond him. The less he allows his writing to be controlled by「precogitated」individual purpose, the more likely it is that truth will work though him as its conduit. The result, in Auerbach, is a principled blindness to the individual purposes of writers he regards as superficial in comparison with Saint-Simon. Pascal's presentation of a Jesuit in the first of the Lettres provinciales, for example, is in the service of classic polemic; Pascal has no need or reason to present a rich and randomly detailed description of an individual Jesuit. But for Auerbach, Pascal's principle of presentation, efficiently governed as it is by his immediate purpose, makes it unlikely that truth, which always lies beyond local purpose, will work through him.

Pascal, like all classic writers, speaks for himself; writers that Auerbach admires hardly speak at all; it is the historical age that speaks through them. The voice of Auerbach's individual genius is not his own; it is the voice of Hegelian historical progress.

Since Auerbach's history presumes to know and to reveal the one ultimate purpose of writing, it can value one style absolutely above all others. Learned and inclusive as Auerbach is, his history is an ideological justification of the universal superiority of that single style, one that has not yet nor ever will be fully manifest in any text by any writer.

Classic style, a general style suitable for presenting the truth of anything, conceived as discrete and self-contained, has no continuing evolutionary history. It can be found in its perfect form in Thucydides, in Madame de Sévigné, in Jane Austen, in A. J. Liebling. It is not the style to which all previous writing aspires. Classic style is one style among many mature and consistent styles. Its virtues follow from its particular stand on the elements of style. They include the clarity and simplicity that come from matching language to thought on the motive of truth. Other styles have other virtues.

清晰既是古典风格的主要优点，也是实用风格的主要优点，很容易用这两种通用风格的任一标准评价其他风格，尤其是那些经常使用二者之一的作者。像实用风格一样，古典风格支持这类评价，暗自主张成为通用风格。但这种主张容易引起误导。古典风格和实用风格都无法实现弥尔顿的目的，因为他的典型场景不是古典风格或实用风格的核心场景。从这点来说，这段话像塞缪尔·约翰逊在《莎士比亚戏剧集序言》开头评论的那样：弥尔顿和约翰逊写出来的风格成熟一致，但和古典风格或实用风格格格不入。古典风格背后的典型场景是对话，因此往往以独立片段出现，摘录的选段也很好理解。《论出版自由》背后的典型场景需要淋漓尽致地展现苦心孤诣的博学。这种场景最看重的是气势庄严和引经据典一而非文笔清晰。它所用的模式不是对话，甚至都不是口头英语；它用的是书面拉丁语模式。弥尔顿的典型场景对他的风格的影响是，单独摘录的片段几乎无法理解，但弥尔顿不会因此把这看作缺陷。他没打算让《论出版自由》以小片段的形式流传，而且让他用一种看起来容易阅读或方便小段选摘的风格，他必定会很难受。假若按照拉罗什福科或李伯龄的风格重写《论出版自由》，弥尔顿的读者肯定当即给它贴上不值一读的标签。

苏格拉底在《苏格拉底的申辩》里提到古典风格的一条检验标准，仿佛它是所有风格的首要问题：「如果你在这个城市的露天场所（你们很多人听过我演讲的地方）或其他地方，听到我用惯用的那种语言为我自己辩白，不要觉得惊讶。」2

他明确拒绝采用法庭那种有腔有调的风格，他暗指这种风格有虚情假意的成分。他采用对话、声音和即兴作为他的典型场景，所以很容易从他的演讲里摘录出通俗易懂的独立话语片段。毕竟《苏格拉底的申辩》加上极少注释翻译过来后，完全能被现在的俄勒冈州或俄亥俄州或上海市的读者读懂，哪怕读者对公元前四世纪初雅典法庭的公约一无所知。

相比之下，想象一位雅典演说家的演讲，和苏格拉底不一样，他的主要目标是要赢得这场审判。当然，上海市或俄亥俄州的现代读者不可能去想这些事情的细节。这样一篇演讲的一些精妙之处，很难被注意到或者很难被理解，就像弥尔顿在《论出版自由》中使用的复杂句法和引用的典故一样。如果不能像弥尔顿（或者那位雅典演说家）那样理解促成他风格的场景，就不可能「改良」他的风格。现今只有少数精通十七世纪英国议会历史的专家才通晓这样的知识，但不见得有谁能用弥尔顿希望的方式以及他自己表达出来的方式，向议会发表演讲。一般的原则（比如「删掉不必要的词」）无法替代场景和角色这类决定某种风格的具体知识，因为只有它们才能表明哪些词不必要。

进段 6-2

虽然之前我已经向你们表明我们的体系中很可能会有，也确实可能有足够的货币刺淡措施未创造「经济复苏」，但我不确定我们是否不需要一些保险措施或不需要重新讨论这个问题，我只能对你们说，我们都在观望渗透其中的同一套数据、同一经济体、同一种信心。我们都在决判经济活动如何演变以及采取各种不同行动的风险在哪里。将来这不可避免会有分歧。

—— 国会听证会上参议员试图让格林斯潘降低利率加速经济复苏（1992 年 3 月），美联储主席阿兰·格林斯潘对此的回应 3

《纽约时报》1992 年 4 月 20 日报道的格林斯潘这段话，当然不是古典风格的例子，但它是一种确定的风格，一种高素质的风格。因为它首先是口语风格（尽管是发表在报纸上供人阅读的报告），格林斯潘先生把它称作「没有条理的喃喃自语」。它的优点恰恰是古典风格的缺点，不应该把这种风格的表现和演讲者的表达能力相混淆。它不是一种含糊的风格，尽管有时看起来这样，因为作者实际表达的结论和观点并没有被隐藏，只是淹没在令人困惑的冗词中了。这更像是一种僵局风格，表达方式依据的是运动不一致且不对称的意象和变化多端的限定条件。它不像古典风格那种通用风格；它是一种特殊风格，专门服务于少部分位居美联储主席这类高位的人，这些人权力很大，他们说的话会被别人用来细致分析他们可能的行动。如果细读上面那段话可以发现，它丝毫没有透露，格林斯潘会降低还是不会降低利率，他是否已经在这个问题上做出了决定，甚至他是否赞成降低利率可以带来参议员们以为的效果。有影响力的政策负责人不得不回应公众时，古典风格的优点可能是他的灾难。国会听证会的调查对象应该看上去是尊重委员会的，所以像阿兰·格林斯潘这样的人不能说：「我来这里是因为我必须在这里，但我不会告诉你们任何东西。」这种场景的情况比较特殊，应该让人觉得他实际上可能说了一些实质性内容，还要尽可能避免说些明显要进一步澄清的问题。如果格林斯潘说，「我认为我们已经把利率降得足够低了，但我们正在不断监测进展，也许到某个时候有可能进一步降低利率。我会适时采取我认为有必要的行动，可能你们不一定认为有必要。」可以更清楚地表达他的主要观点，但要为此付出不可接受的代价。他用一种明确的方式向参议员表明，他会做他认为最好的事，不管他们怎么想的都不会影响他，这种做法不够明智，而且他也不希望明确否定他们的建议，因为无论他表明会还是不会降低利率都对他不利，表明他何时会下定决心也同样不利。前面假定的修改版本当然更清楚，但会引来恼人的追问：那么就目前来说，您已经不考虑降低利率了？未来什么情况下，降低利率是合理的？你是依据什么指标判断出目前的利率太高？

必须避免引发所有这类提问，因为他实际上不希望透露自己之后的任何行动方向。他对可能的行动给出的任何暗示，都会引发不同市场的回应。在这种情况下，「虽然之前我已经向你们表明我们的体系中很可能会有，也确实可能有，足够的货币刺激措施来创造…」，这句活在名方面都会优于「我认为我们已经把利事降得足够低了」。这种声明附加各种限定条件，也没明确生效日期或谈论内容，虽然看起来做了让步，但实际上对他可能要做的事只字未提。「虽然我在过去的某个时候说过某事 X」，让听众以为下一句是「现在我要说说某事 Y」。实际的顺序不是这样，接着的那句话完全不符合预期，而且极其混乱不清，以至于读者很难立即认清其实没有做出任何让步。事后分析后可能才生出疑惑，但他甚至仍然认为已经采取了足够的措施「来创造」（创造什么呢？厌烦的读者会问），因为整个句子的框架是「之前我已经向你们表明」，但后面没有对等地提到讲话人现在要讲什么。为避免说成毫无防范的现在陈述语气或一瞬间就能被识别出来的确定主张，格林斯潘使用了微妙的语言资源：情态动词、模棱两可的参照、疑问副词、不确定的将来时或不确定的现在进行时。

从这个选段及其特殊场景考虑的特别要求中，我们得到两点提示：第一，某种风格的缺点会成为另一种风格的优点；第二，不是只有好与坏两种风格之分，而是有很多种风格，有些是通用风格，有些只适用于特定场景。几乎所有的英文作文教师都会说这个选段「需要修改」，然后指出它的错误之处。事实上，它哪里都没错。这是一种高超的表达方式，把迟迟不作答复的态度伪装成语言表达上的不连贯。它写得一点也不马虎，也并非毫无计划。它故意违反预期中前后对称、方向一致的意象图式，运用精湛的技巧阻断了这种预期。这是一种非常准确的表达，就像一只猫跳上一张杂乱无章的桌子，走过一片狼藉，却没有搅乱这片狼藉。

表面特征不决定风格

选段 6-3

本备忘录…...讨论的话题可以说是作者和出版商遇到的问题中最不重要的部分。正是因为它们相对来说没那么重要（尽管它们也有可能带来麻烦），所以我们应该不用太把心。换句话说，我们的工作就是让它们不成问题，以便将我们的精力投入到更重要的事情中 —— 作者和编辑发挥才智和想象力平衡事实和表达，设计师和排版人员做出高效精美的排版，校对人员保证快速准确的勘误。

虽然逗号风格的一些问题（例如，限定性从句与非限定性从句，一个用逗号隔开主从句，一个不用遮号隔开），在日常表达中已经根深蒂固，以至于成为某类规则，但几乎所有这些都只是偏好问题。我们更偏向列举事物时在连词前用逗号（red, white, and blue），也会在「i. e.（也就是）」和「e. g.（例如）」之后加逗号。

在事倍功半这点上，英语拼写体系符合那些人尽皆知的规范的全部要求。它过时、累赞又低效：掌握英语拼写需要花大量时间和精力：一旦拼错，很容易被发现。

—— 托斯丹·凡勃仑，《有闲阶级论》4

对于只在英文写作课上读过写作指南或手册的读者，普林斯顿大学出版社备忘录的态度可能让他们感到惊讶，因为在他们的写作课上，大写、拼写、发音和用法看起来不仅是写作最明显的表面特征，实际上是写作的全部。这种本末倒置的问题很常见，正因为这些偶然因素容易被注意到。这是为什么托斯丹·凡勃伦在一本古典风格社会学著作中提到，拼写体现了某种形式的社会差异，有闲暇的人才能学会一种随机又低效的体系。地名的发音和拼写这类问题，常常用作区分当地人和外地人的标记。一位杰出的美国神学家在高速公路上开车，中途停下来问贝洛伊特（Beloit）怎么走，当地人听到他的法语发音方式「贝瓦」（Bell- wah）后哈哈大笑，然后告诉他说，「是贝洛伊特（Beh-LOIT），伙计。你现在在威斯康星州了。」

偶然因素几乎不会成为风格要素的一部分，但是如果不妥善对待，它们会带来各种大大小小的问题，因为它们体现了作者对写作规则和规范的掌握程度。有人认为字典和手册规定了这些问题，这是一种常见的误解。字典和手册只不过是尽可能符合某个没有明确定义的人群的说话习惯，是他们规定了这类问题普遮的偏好限制。词典编辑的立场跟不希望因某种错误方式惹人注目的个人一样。但跟他们很多人不同的是，词典编辑自知只是观察一场社会影响力比赛，而不是记录 —— 更不是定义 —— 某种正确的立场。

露易丝·布鲁克斯一定是默片年代所有性感偶像中最优秀的一位作家，她在《露露在好菜坞》这本书里解释说，她意识到自己有堪萨斯口音时很痛苦，因为这让她在纽约看起来像外乡人。她在一家经常光顾的杂货店的饮料柜前，遇到一位哥伦比亚大学的学生，她说尽好话，让他做她的语言老师。用她自己的话说就是：

不读「mulk」读「milk」，不读「kee-yow」读「cow」。还有：不要像读「hotter」一样读成「watter」，要像读「daughter」一样读「water」。不是「help」，你真是乡巴佬一读「help」「hep」「help」！吃了一个月的巧克力圣代，这个男孩用他自己的方法教我词汇，我讨厌的堪萨斯口音连最后一点痕迹都没有了。从一开始，我就想好了，不能从一种标签换成另一种标签。我不想学艾娜·克莱尔、鲁斯·查特顿那些正统的喜剧明星，说一本正经的伦敦舞台英语。我只想说一口纯正的、不带标签的英语。我在饮料柜前认识的小伙儿说的就是纯正的、不带标签的英语。5

露易丝·布鲁克斯认为在二十世纪二十年代的纽约，一位性感尤物不能经常把「cow」说成「ke-yow」，这种想法无疑是对的，但是由此认定她已经会说「无标签」英语，就大错特错了。她只是放弃了一个不合时宜的标签，换上一个与她努力塑造的形象更相符的标签。且不说绝原先的堪萨斯口音，她跟那位饮料柜前的纽约小伙儿学会的「纯正的无标签英语」，如果在路易斯安那州的巴吞鲁日听起来会怎样呢？在得克萨斯州的沃思堡呢？在伊利诺伊州的芝加哥呢？又或者在布鲁克林区大桥对面呢？

同样的社会原则适用语言的许多显著特征，但这些特征都不能决定语言风格。「Negro」（黑鬼）这个词已从现代美式英语用法中剔除，后来出现的替代语「black」（黑人）也逐渐被摒弃。「黑鬼」的古老用法是什么时候出现的，谁决定了这个问题？当然不是美国的词典。它们只是调查目前的词语用法，直到确定这种变化被广泛接受。今天，同样的现象也出现在「black」（黑人）这个词上，它本身很快就会在日常使用过程中被海汰，被「Afro-American」或「African American」（非裔美国人）其中一个词取代。哪个词会赢得这场竞争取决于谁最先被广泛使用。

所有这些竞争会引起许多作者和演讲者的焦虑，因为用词「不当」会让作者或演讲者看起来可笑。因此，自称语言大师的人总有大片的市场，而且每家书店都有整排的语言规范手册，好像所有这些问题都已经解决了似的，虽然这些书之间总不免会相互矛盾。出版商及其技术人员倒没有什么幻想；他们知道用母语说话或写作的人只是社会地位不同，没有谁是语言权威。他们也知道虽然偶然的问题可能会带来尴尬，但无论用词多么准确，也不可能形成一种风格，而且太过担心偶然问题，反而可能损害风格。二十世纪二十年代有很多女演员把「cow」说成「kee-yow」，但她们中没有一个能塑造出露易丝·布鲁克斯塑造出的那种形象。而且，假如露易丝·布鲁克斯太想发音准确而表现得焦虑，她将破坏那种形象。

有时候即使有非凡影响力的人，也会误解这方面的问题。《纽约时报》和《华盛顿邮报》报道了瑟古德·马歇尔 1989 年决定在一份以美国最高法院副法官身份提交的书面意见中使用「Afro-American」一词。

一开始，这位声名显赫的法官解释自己的动机：「我花了大半生时间，费尽心思让人们拼写 Negro 这个词时大写首字母… 后来人们开始改用 black，我从来都不喜欢这个词。」6 

然后他说自己当初如何严重低估了自己的权威：「马歇尔法官说他会用 Afro-American，而不是 African American，现在前一个词越来越流行，因为‘词典收录了 Afo-American 但没收录另一个词 。」

优势可能是缺陷

选股 6-4

蒙田在他的家乡加斯科湿和他的蒙田塔楼里，就已经发现一种天才风格，但那是一种完全个人化的风格，很难效仿。帕斯卡发现了一种风格 —— 既是一种带天才属性的个性化风格，完全属于他自己，任何人都无法夺走，又是一种有逻有规律的通用风格，有法则般的力量，每个人戎多或少都能、也应该采用的一种标准 —— 他开创了法国救文。

—— 圣伯夫，《波尔-罗雅尔修道院史》7

在行家里手的笔下，古典风格可以独具一格，又不显得个人化。它默认无须依赖作者的个性形成风格。圣伯夫在对比蒙田和帕斯卡两位伟大的法国作家时，指出了古典风格的这种特征。

当然，正是十九世纪的法国教育官僚主义使帕斯卡的风格成为类似「法则」一样的风格，也决定了他不仅展示出一种风格的力量，而且「开创了法国散文」。尽管如此，这种明显的悖论 —— 声称帕斯卡的风格既能保留个性，又能为每个人所用，甚至多多少少还是一种规定 —— 源自古典风格在真相、呈现、场景、角色、思想和语言上采取的立场。从教学目的上来说，帕斯卡可以说是典范，因为他的风格恰是一种通用风格。

没有学生可能达到帕斯卡那种精通水平，但他的风格作为典范的用处在于，几乎任何人都可以掌握基本能力，且不需要帕斯卡那样的非凡才能，也不需要他那种特别的热情和使命感。只属于他个人的东西不属于古典风格，从这点来看，他的主要成就更多在于对写作的发现，而不是对他自己的思想的书面表达。古典风格并不要求出众的反思能力、非凡的个人洞见，或突出的个人努力；它自始至终默认的主张是，只呈现读者站在合适位置就能自己验证的内容。十七世纪的法国作者将这种风格运用到各种文学形式上：个人信函、道德箴言录、至少一部知名小说，以及代表十七世纪法国散文特色的回忆录文学。拉罗什福科和他的对手莱兹两人的回忆录，都具备古典风格所有的重要特征。虽然他们的观察结果确实是他们自己观察来的，但他们从不要求读者接受完全个人化的表达。像所有古典风格作者一样，他们要做所有工作，而且不能被察觉到，他们暗示，他们在做的事情，（除一些碰机会的偶然事物外）读者都能做到。正如十九世纪莱兹的一位文学编辑所说：

对他（莱兹）来说，语言显然只是一种呈现他的思想的方式，或者更妙地，可以信手拈来呈现任何一天的人、事，尤其是他自己的行为。8

选段 6-5

对人物和场景犹如潮涌、充满细节的回忆，让这位写回忆录的圣西门公舞感到自己的笔几乎吸不上。显然圣西门完全相信，对梦个回忆录来说，他所能记起的一切是不可或缺的，并且他色可以把所有的一切安括进去，无须事先考虑取舍。

—— 埃里希·奥尔巴赫，《尊仿论》① 9

① 汉译文出自吴麒级、周新建、高艳婷合译版本，本书其他（模仿论》选段均出自该版本。—— 译者注

他坐在来子对面，两根蜡烛之间，我们面对面，中间只有一张来子的宽度。我刻意描绘了他那可怕的表情。突然我被看到的和听到的所震撼，他谈论起什么才是一个教士：无论以其个人还是公众身份，一个教士都无法为他的家人做什么，也不可能用他的地位和权利为自己谋私利，甚至不可能比别人多一个草果或多一杯酒：只有到了一定的年龄才可能与上帝会面：处心积忠的阴谋会把国家和教会置于水深火热之中，并会因为一些涉及莫利那学派声誉的问题而纠缠不休。他的深奥，他所表现出的粗暴，所有这一切都令我迷茫，于是我打断他问道：「我的上帝，您多大岁数了？」他是那么的惊讶，因为我全神贯注地看着他，他那种惊讶呈现在脸上，唤醒了我的意识…...

—— 埃里希·奥尔巴赫，《摹仿论》引用圣西门的话 10

在《禁仿论》一书里，罗曼语语言学家埃里希·奥尔巴赫提供了一系列精彩的风格分析，分析类型为文本解释（explication de texte）。他按照时间顺序编排他选出来的文章，开头是荷马和古代以色列的宗教圣典，结尾是弗吉尼亚·伍尔夫和马塞尔·普鲁斯特的选段。这本书美泽版的副标题「The Representation of Realityin Westen Literature」（西方文学中现实的再现）反映了他的书的主题，他讨论的文章的排序体现了该主题，被认为是反映了再现型风格的演变进程，这类再现型风格的效果越来越取决于作者与读者的典型角色要求的明显对等关系。在这里，菜兹和帕斯卡的古典风格被认为俗套和肤浅，而圣西门的表现奇特且不拘一格，他描绘的路易十四宫廷人物无可比拟，不仅表现在人物的个性和复杂性上，还表现在戏剧性上。圣西门的散文不是一扇窗，而是杂技演员走的高空钢丝，这个平台上展现的高超技艺，显然超出了读者的能力，而且作者也只能勉强驾驭。作者挑战他的艺术极限时并没有那么得心应手，他的语言时不时在句法不连贯的边缘踉跄，但又常常取得惊人的结果，部分源于天才的灵感，部分源于幸运的巧合。

奥尔巴赫对圣西门的评价基于一种信念：人类生存的真相远非清晰简单；对任何一个个体来说，它都是未知且不可知的，但在历史进程中展示了自己，即个体的对立统一面，这些个体被看作一种序列，不知不觉中逐渐揭示了我们认识的人类真相。

古典风格视角把具体的历史事件看作揭示永恒真相的场合，而浪漫主义视角把它看作真相在历史中逐渐展开时的某些时刻，从后者的视角来看，古典风格的呈现（presentation）不如浪漫风格的再现（representation）。这正是奥尔巴赫的选择。





他对古典风格和浪漫风格的这种比较，自然会推翻古典风格的价值。它开头的说明偏好灵感而非理性次序：构思过程中出现的不可预测的洞见优于古典模式中写作之前的深思熟虑。对于像奥尔巴赫这样的浪漫派来讲，深思熟虑后的表达只是肤浅而虚伪的幻象；写作过程中产生的灵感才是真实与真相的标志：「一切与他的主题相关的事物，他依照脑海中浮现的样子写进一个个句子，他完全相信统一清晰的句子会自然而然地形成。」11 对奥尔巴赫来说，圣西门可能没有看到这种统一和清晰，这不是缺陷，他可以充当一位灵感传导者，让未来的读者看到。

古典风格注重可靠而非个人化的理性分析次序；它不相信感觉和情绪上的体验次序，它们不可靠、过于个人化，而且常常被证明是错的。

奥尔巴赫则顺倒了这种价值标准：

圣西门的深刻认识不是通过对思想及问题的理性分析获得的，而是通过他面对的任意一个感官现象所产生的、深入生存内部的经脸。相反（为了引用一个易于理解的例子）《致外省人信礼》第一封信中的耶稣会士显然是按服上述理性认知而被风格化了。2

浪漫风格认为真相难以捉摸，难以窥见全貌，所以从浪漫风格视角来看，为瞥见不可预知的真相而追随感觉自然在情理之中。如果真相不是恒定不变可进行理性分析的，而只是闪现出暗示性的零星画面，那作者肯定总是写得诚惶诚恐，时刻担心脑海中闪现的灵感一瞬即逝。因为闪现的节奏是间歌且不可预测的，浪漫风格总是急于捕捉这种感觉以及它可能暗示的含义。这种模式在古典风格中是不可想象的，因为真相对任何有能力的人都完全可见，也不会一闪即逝。古典真相从不会消散。所以古典呈现从容而自在 —— 但这在奥尔巴赫看来是自负和自我欺骗的表现。

表达内心冲动的欲望使得（圣西门的）语言不同寻常，也偶有强词夺理、言过其实之处，与那个时代轻松自如、讨人喜欢的审美品位大相径庭。13

奥尔巴赫认为人性真相「深奥晦涩」（profondeurs opaques）：真相会表现成特殊的灵感碎片，在特殊的时刻被特殊的人发觉。它会在观察者没有预料到的时候出现。例如，圣西门在与耶稣会士泰利埃神父对话的过程中，根据奥尔巴赫的说法，顿悟到「任何组织严密的团体的根本性质」14 这一真相。当然，这种真相观念完全不属于古典风格。深奥晦涩的灵感碎片只能凭个人的才智捕捉到，在奥尔巴赫看来，作者呈现这些无法完全理解的碎片是正直的表现。但从古典视角来看，这样一种呈现只是失败的实证。在古典风格中，表达呈现的是思考的结果。不经思考的灵感捕捉式写作，对古典风格而言是缺陷，但对奥尔巴赫来说是优势：

书中没有虚构，没有编造，所有内容都出自作者的耳闻目睹，这使圣西门的作品有一种生活的深度。在这方面，甚至连几十年中以描写人物见长的莫里哀和拉布吕那尔都望尘莫及。15

古典风格认为，这种评价根本无法理解，因为用来支持该主张的证据看起来反倒对它不利。在古典风格看来，这种评价的逻辑无异于「猜测胜过正确认识，因为猜测更个人化」。

如奥尔巴赫所述，个人的才智由不可预见的碎片灵感构成，作者无法控制它们。任何能够用理性的方式控制的东西都是肤浅的技巧，而非深刻的真相。这种才智是一种特别恩赐 —— 可以在某些灵光一现的预见性时刻洞察真相，就像 E. B. 怀特记录他对绕着马戏圈骑马的女孩的印象时，短暂地警见了时间的性质。但不论是圣西门还是怀特，都不能指望这类启示。它们可能再也不会出现在作者的脑海中，它们可能永远都无法被读者捕捉到。奥尔巴赫认为的优点，对古典风格而言是自我错觉。

简·奥斯汀对《傲慢与偏见》中的柯林斯先生的描写令人印象深刻 —— 这已是深思熟虑的常规描写 —— 但用奥尔巴赫的价值标准看来，这必然也是流于肤浅。

柯林斯先生并不是个聪明人，他虽然受过教有，踏进了社会，但是先天的缺陷却没得到多少弥补。他长了这么大，大部分岁月是在他那个爱钱如命的文盲父亲的教导下度过的。他也算进过大学，但只是勉强混了几个学期，也没交上一个有用的朋友。

父亲的严厉管教使他养成了唯唯诺诺的习性，但是这种习性如今又给大大抵消了，因为他本来就是个蠢材，一下子过上了悠闲生活，难免会枫枫然起来，何况年纪轻轻就发了意外之财，自然会越发自命不凡。当时亨斯福德教区有个牧师空缺，柯林斯鸿运事通，得到了凯瑟琳·德布尔夫人的套识。他一方面敬仰凯瑟琳夫人的崇高地位，尊崇她作为自己的女思主，另一方面又非常看重自己，珍惜自己做教士的权威，做教区长的权利，这一切造就了他一身兼有微慢与恭顺、自负与谦单的双重性格。① 16

① 汉译文出自孙致礼翻译版本。—— 译者注

从古典风格的角度来看，简·奥斯汀的呈现优势在于，一旦她告诉你往哪里看，她对柯林斯先生的评价就可以由任何读者独立「验证」（就像她书中的人物脸证的那样）。圣西门运用精湛的手法描写泰利埃神父，并讲述了他对耶稣会士的本质的洞察，但是，虽然有些人或许能验证圣西门呈现的耶稣会士的可怕相貌，但除了作者本人没人能根据一位耶稣会士的外貌描述看出整个入群的本质。从对单个个体的印象推断出对整个群体的认识，这种思维模式正是简·奥斯汀所说的「偏见」。《做慢与偏见》描述了伊丽莎白·班纳特从这种自欺欺人的思维模式中悔悟的故事。圣西门的真相启示在简·奥斯汀看来是偏见。

《禁仿论》是一本关于风格演变史的书，这必然是后来者居上的事情。奥尔巴赫可能会把某个特定的作家，比如圣西门，看作一种能展示未来生活的神奇突变：「从文体上说，圣西门是描述各种现代和最现代的人生观和再现生活的先驱。」17。对奥尔巴赫来说，真相不是个人财产，实际上根本无法被个人拥有：它存在于一种辩证过程中 —— 存在于时代的历史主义行为而非个人的历史行为当中。个体作家的价值，体现在他在多大程度上参与了这一辩证过程。也就是说，一位伟大作家的个人才能，在于他能通过直接的人和事，看到进化历史主义进程中的真相。圣西门的成就在于，他是第一个瞀见更高阶段的时代真相的人，正如奥尔巴赫分析圣西门对洛尔日公爵夫人（duchesse de Lorge）的描述时所言：

到十九世纪未，甚至直到二十世纪，人们才在欧洲文学中我到一个类似的语调，一个完全脱离传统和谐，直接从任意的表象信息深入到一个人生存环境的综合体。18

按照这种观点，奥尔巴赫有可能为不同时代及其发展进程赋予能动性，而不是将其赋予在个人身上；比如他写道，「那个时代轻松自如、讨人喜欢的审美品位」，就好像时代有品位，而不是个人。在奥尔巴赫的表述中，早期的品位必然不够完善。虽然早期的品位可能会延续到未来，与后期的品位融于同一个时代，但它们将在历史主义的距大完善链（Great Chain of Adequacy）位置。埃里希·奥尔巴赫透露，轻松自如和讨人喜欢的品位现已成为演变史的过去，几乎不可能让今天的我们 —— 处于风格等级演变史较高位置的我们 —— 理解以前的风格创造出来的品位。

在奥尔巴赫看来，判断风格是否成熟的标准在于写作能否超越当前的及个人的人类目的传达历史主义真相，他自然也认为个人目的会阻码真相再现。作者涵盖的内容越广泛，按个人目的选择的内容越少，他的文章就越可能触及超脱他个人的真相。尽可能减少「事先谋划」的个人目的对文章的影响，真相越有可能选择他作为传达者。所以奥尔巴赫从原则上忽视非圣西门一流的肤浅作家的个人目的。比如，帕斯卡在《致外省人信札》第一封信里对耶稣会士的描写，就服务于古典风格论辩：帕斯卡没有必要也没有理由，巨细无遗地随机描写某个个体耶稣会士。但奥尔巴赫认为，帕斯卡这种呈现原则，实际上是为了实现他当前的目的，因此超脱个体目的存在的真相不可能通过帕斯卡传达给读者。

像所有古典风格作者一样，帕斯卡为自己说话；奥尔巴赫推崇的作者几乎从不说话；是历史年代在通过他们说话。奥尔巴赫通过个人才智发出的声音，不是他自己的声音，是黑格尔派历史进程发出的声音。

因为奥尔巴赫的演变史是要认识和揭示写作的终极目的的，所以它追求一种优于所有其他风格的风格。尽管奥尔巴赫博学而包容，他的演变史只是从意识形态上证明了他那一种风格胜过所有风格，但不曾也不会有任何作者写出任何文本充分体现这种风格。

作为一种适合呈现任何事物真相的通用风格，古典风格自成一体，没有连续的演变历史。修昔底德、塞维涅夫人、简·奥斯汀、李伯龄写出了完美的古典风格。并不是以前的每篇文章都用古典风格写。它只是众多成熟一致的风格中的一种。它的优势源于它对风格要素采取的特定立场，包括清晰和简单，因为语言可匹配思想，动机是真相。其他风格也都有其各自的优势。
