THREE The Studio

### Introduction

The first part of this book — which we will call「the Essay」 — presents principles of style. The second — the Museum — presents exhibits and analyses of style. Once we had written the Essay and the Museum, we thought we had finished our book. Anyone who wanted to acquire the style, we assumed, had everything necessary at hand. All we had left out was the work involved in acquiring the style. Classic style pretends there is no work in writing, and we had happily skipped right over all the stages we had gone through ourselves in acquiring this most versatile and useful style. It is no secret that writing in any style is work, so we have added the Studio to our book — a place where apprentices can progress from inevitably awkward beginnings to confident mastery in semiprivacy under the benevolent eye of a friendly master who looks forward to regarding them as equals, perhaps superiors.

Fundamentals: Talk First

In a studio, apprentices learn fundamentals and become masters. The fundamentals, in this Studio, are taught through a set of common exercises — common in the sense that they are intended to be performed both in speech and in writing. We begin with speech because classic style grounds writing in speech.

EXERCISE 1: Classic Joint Attention

The radical of presentation is a scene that cognitive scientists call「joint attention.」Joint attention is a familiar and common scene, one we experience routinely. In joint attention, people in one place are attending to one thing; they know they are all attending to it, and they know that by attending to it they are engaged with one another. They are jointly interacting. They may gesture and talk about what is engaging their attention, but it may be that no word is actually spoken. They are engaged in influencing one another's minds; words can help but are not essential. Joint attention does not necessarily have a practical goal. What is essential is common and interactive attention.

「Classic joint attention」is the simplest and most basic kind of joint attention. We have specified the features of classic joint attention in the Essay and in the Museum: there are just two people, paying attention to something that is directly perceptible, such as a blackbird in a tree. All of the features of classic style pertain: the motive is truth, the purpose is presentation, the scene is informal, language is adequate, truth can be known, speaker and hearer are competent, and so on. Not only do these two people see the same blackbird, but they also see it in the same mental context, a context that includes their influence on one another.

Classic joint attention is so familiar and common that we typically do not think about it or even notice it. But classic joint attention is the classic scene, the anchor of classic style. To become a classic stylist, one must be able to think about the classic scene consciously, to notice which actual scenes fit the classic scene, which are close, which are distant, and the ways in which an actual scene can differ from the classic scene. Failure to keep this classic scene in mind will result in a style that loses its anchor. Naturally, the first exercise in the Studio is to practice inhabiting an actual classic scene.

Here, then, is the first exercise: notice something directly perceptible and present it in speech to a companion who is next to you. You and your companion can be anywhere: in a park, a garden, a restaurant, walking down the street, in a grocery store, in a station waiting for a train. Recall from the Essay that to present something to someone is not merely to call attention to it, as in,「Look, there is a blackbird.」Rather, to present something is to present what you want your companion to perceive. You expect your companion to be able to perceive what you are presenting once it is pointed out, as in,「That blackbird on the tree limb by the hedge has a small red stripe on each wing.」What you present might be, for example, an architectural detail — something that is easy to see once your attention is directed to it, but something that just as easily could be missed. It does not have to be something visual. It could be the melody of a bird's song or the salt in the sea breeze.

Like all the exercises in this Studio, this first exercise suits the classroom. Get a partner. Observe the room, the people, what lies beyond the windows, sounds and images from a mobile device, anything in your perceptual fields. Someone might run a slideshow depicting scenes from nature, buildings, works of art, airports, city spots, a movie. Begin a conversation with your partner and make brief classic presentations as the conversation progresses. This activity may seem artificial and uncomfortable at first, because you are trying to do something consciously that you prefer to do automatically. During this exercise, listen not just to your partner, but to your own voice. As you speak, monitor what you are saying. Initially, this conscious attention to your own speech will cause hesitation and even embarrassment. Keep at it. Eventually, you will relax more and more until it feels natural to inhabit the scene of classic joint attention and speak in classic style. The instructor may wish to take the class out of the classroom, for a walk, to a café, down a city street, to an art museum, to a garden. Continue your conversation with your partner as you go, taking every opportunity for classic presentation.

TUTORIAL: Beyond Classic Joint Attention

Learning to focus consciously on the classic scene and to perform within it is the first step to becoming a classic stylist. But most of human communication goes beyond the classic scene in one way or another. In any act of communication, you will have in mind a network of thoughts and ideas that can be quite complicated, and this network might be too large, too detailed, and too complex to be held in mind all at once. The network might include your own identity, the identity of others, past experiences, aspirations, inferences, judgments, predictions, and many varieties of cultural knowledge. The network will also include an array of participants: perhaps you think that many people are listening to you or will listen to you. Perhaps in this network of your thoughts, there are important differences between individual members of your audience. Perhaps this network involves unknown or even fictional or imaginary participants. This mental network might involve large intervals of time — perhaps you are reacting to a criticism that someone made a week ago of a speech given by Abraham Lincoln, and you know that tomorrow someone else will comment on your response. The mental network might involve a long and complex chain of cause and effect. It might involve different and even conflicting motives or purposes. In this mental network, there might be complex ideas about how your expression will be distributed, received, and remembered. And of course, your subject in the mental network — what you want to talk about — might be very different from a directly perceptible object. We will call everything you are trying to juggle mentally「the network.」A network can be close to or distant from the idea of the classic scene. Some networks will be close in some ways and distant in others. The second step to becoming a classic stylist is to learn to anchor any network in the classic scene.

When you are actually with a companion, looking at a blackbird perched in a tree, and present something about the blackbird, you are inhabiting the classic scene. But now suppose you are talking to the same person on the telephone and, let us say, telling her something you saw when she was not with you. For this telephone conversation, you are using a particular mental network. It contains what you want to present, the mode of communication, the other person in a different place, the fact that you can't see one another, the delay between perception and conversation — the list is long. A telephone call is not an instance of the classic scene. Although the difference is obvious when you focus on it, it may be invisible at first. The reason the two scenes may not seem at first to lie in two different categories is that we ordinarily structure the telephone call by the classic scene. We anchor the first in the second. We can perform in an actual scene that goes beyond classic joint attention by anchoring our performance in that classic scene. We blend a network of thought — in which, for example, we view ourselves as alone with a telephone or a computer — with our idea of classic joint attention. Writing a letter to someone is not the same as talking to that person. Writing is never an instance of the classic scene. But in writing to someone we know well, it is easy and conventional to treat this writing as if it were conversation. This is an example of what we mean by structuring one scene, writing, by another, conversation. In a way, we treat the scene in which one person is alone with a piece of paper as if it were the scene in which two people share simultaneous access to something. In writing to her sister, Jane Austen says,「I have now attained the true art of letter-writing . . . I have been talking to you almost as fast as I could the whole of this letter.」Writing is not talking at all, much less engaging in conversation, but writing can be anchored in our understanding of talking and even, as here, in our understanding of a one-sided turn in a two-person conversation.

This sort of「blending」of the classic scene with a mental network that does not strictly fit that scene is fundamental to classic style. Treating something we cannot perceive — 「an obvious blunder,」for example — as if it were something anybody could「see」is an example of how a judgment can be treated as a perceptible object. The judgment is in the network; the perceptible object is in the classic scene. We blend them, and in the blend, treat the judgment, stylistically, as if it were a perceptible object. Often, in ordinary communication, we do quite classic things, but unless we focus consciously on the classic scene and the way in which we use it to anchor unclassic networks, our performance will be inconsistent and unreliable. Operating in the dark, we might float into and out of classic style without recognizing what we are doing. The result will be a style that is not under our control, and confusing for the reader. The classic stylist keeps clearly in mind what belongs to the anchor and what belongs to the network, and anchors the network in the classic scene. The mental networks we actually use in scenes of communication can vary greatly, but the anchor scene — classic joint attention — never varies, and this anchor sets the style.

Imagine that you are on a train, going through a landscape you have never seen before. The train stops in a rural station during the afternoon. Pointing to a tree outside the train window, you say to your companion,「That apple tree is bearing two different kinds of fruit.」This is a scene of classic joint attention. Now imagine that you are writing a letter to your companion, who is back home. You write,「The train is stopped in a rural station. The apple tree outside the window bears two different kinds of fruit, one green and mottled, the other red fading to yellow.」This is classic style, anchored in the scene of classic joint attention.

The goal of every one of the following exercises is to develop your ability to take things that lie beyond classic joint attention and anchor them stylistically in that scene.

Insisting on the distinction between the scene of classic joint attention and scenes that are merely structured by it may seem to be unnecessary, but recognizing that distinction is indispensable to learning classic style. In the Studio, you learn how to structure networks by the scene of classic joint attention, and to do that, you must first recognize what is being done. Once you recognize it, you can focus on it and learn to anchor networks in the classic scene. If you don't recognize what is happening, the performance remains a mystery. Recognizing what it means for a network to be structured by classic joint attention is the single most significant step to mastering classic style.

EXERCISE 2: Hiding the Labor

In the second exercise, introduce a single small change to the scene of classic joint attention that you practiced in the first exercise. You are still in a garden or walking down a street or in a restaurant or listening to a piece of music with someone. You direct your companion's attention to something that can be perceived, but what you ask your companion to notice is not something you have just noticed yourself. It is something you already know. In calling your companion's attention to it, however, you treat it in the same way you would treat something you observed just then. You offer no explanation of how you came to notice it yourself or how long you have known it. It is actually there to be seen, and you are not pretending that you have just noticed it; you simply point it out. There is nothing in the style of your presentation that marks it as something you already knew. Suppose that you are on your surfboard beyond the break zone of the waves, and your companion is on her surfboard five yards away. You have known for years how the pattern of the waves changes with the change in tide. And you know, too, from having studied the surf report for the day that the tide is going out just now. You say,「The tide is going out. The waves are breaking farther south, and bigger.」The effect of the tide on the waves, although absolutely evident the minute you point it out, is just the kind of thing that people can look at without noticing. Your own recognition is not spontaneous; it rests upon a lengthy process of observation and study. The mental network you are dealing with goes beyond classic joint attention, but what you say is anchored stylistically in that scene. Here is the second exercise: present in speech to someone actually with you something directly perceptible that you have in fact noticed before, without marking stylistically that you knew it before.

EXERCISE 3: Fresh Inferences

The third exercise asks you to move on to inferences. You are making an inference, for example, when you think that someone「looks disappointed.」The fact that the「disappointment」is an inference rather than something perceptible often goes unnoticed. We have to remind ourselves that a common phrase such as「You could see disappointment all over his face」is not literally true. The paradox is that throughout your life you have unconsciously treated some of these invisible inferences as things that can be perceived — but now, we are asking you to be aware that you are doing it, so that you can improve your command of style.

Here is the third exercise: present in speech to someone actually with you something directly perceptible and, in addition this time, present a related inference, but not one marked by any stylistic change in the presentation. Treat the inference the way you treat the perception. Here is an example:「That egret standing so still in the estuary is fishing.」You can see the egret, the estuary, the standing, the stillness, but you cannot see the fishing. The style blends perception with inference.

EXERCISE 4: Previous Inferences

Here is the fourth exercise: combine exercises 2 and 3. Study a scene and think it through until you have made an inference connected to what is directly perceptible. Then, when you are joined by your companion, make your presentation without marking stylistically the difference between perception and inference, the sequence connecting perception to inference, or the archival nature of your inference. Here is an example: suppose you have deduced at some point that a restaurant dining room with an ocean view down the street from where you live must once have been an outdoor patio, now enclosed. You say to your dining companion,「We are lucky to be here with an ocean storm setting in. Those electrical outlets in the wall have covers because this room used to be outside.」

EXERCISE 5: Focusing on a Person

The fifth exercise is the same as the fourth but focuses on a person. Among things that cannot be directly perceived — interest, disappointment, hope — many of them cannot even be inferred at a glance. They are discoveries that take time. They depend upon a series of refinements that eventually leads to an inference. But, as we said in laying out the principles of classic style, the style「does not acknowledge process or stages of discovery, does not acknowledge revision or successive refinements.」Since the style does not acknowledge process, what might, in fact, be the result of observation stretching over a long period, with many stages and many revisions, is presented in the same style as something that can be observed at once, like a blackbird.

How long did La Rochefoucauld know Madame de Chevreuse before he could say she「had sparkling intelligence, ambition, and beauty in plenty; she was flirtatious, lively, bold, enterprising; she used all her charms to push her projects to success, and she almost always brought disaster to those she encountered on her way」? He could not have known this the first time he met her, but the style does nothing to draw attention to the steps by which he came to know her.

Everyone notices, after a while, features of temperament, personality, and character that are not directly perceptible. They often remain unspoken observations. Here is the fifth exercise: you and a companion are both looking at someone. Present the person. Include something you have come to notice only gradually. Your subject might be the bartender, the postal clerk, your Chinese teacher, the manager of the bicycle repair shop, or, if you are doing this in the classroom, someone you see in or from the room. Include inferences. Do not let your observation be displaced by whatever experience led to it, and do not mark the inferences stylistically as different from the perceptions.

TUTORIAL: Two Steps to Classic Style

You have now worked on the indispensable first exercise and four other exercises that go beyond the fundamental scene of classic joint attention. In exercises 2 to 5, you used the classic scene to structure scenes that did not fit it for one reason or another — the subject of presentation was not directly perceptible, or the recognition was not spontaneous.

This pattern — inhabit the classic scene, and then use it to manage networks that go beyond it — is the essential lesson of the Studio because these two steps are the whole art of classic style:

Step 1: Learn to inhabit the scene of classic joint attention consciously. In this first step we learn to do something consciously and consistently that we already do unconsciously and inconsistently.

Step 2: Learn how to blend the classic scene with any mental network supporting expression, so that the blend provides a familiar, consistent, manageable anchor for that network. You probably are not used to thinking of classic joint attention as a general「scene」; you probably do not consistently distinguish between what is directly perceptible, such as a blackbird, and what is not, such as a sense of the absurd. So when you are asking a companion to「notice」somebody's sense of the absurd, especially when that somebody is not actually present, you should be aware that you are not in a scene of classic joint attention at all. In the previous exercises, you already moved from step 1 to step 2. For example, when you presented an inference, you were inviting your companion to recognize your conclusion as if it were directly perceptible. This is an exemplary case of borrowing classic joint attention to structure the presentation of what cannot be directly perceived.

Often in writing, you will feel that things are getting away from you. You are not mistaken. Things are in fact getting away from you. Notice that you never feel that things are getting away from you when you are pointing out something directly perceptible to somebody next to you. You are at home in this case because the classic scene is intelligible by itself. In classic style, all other scenes become intelligible and manageable because they are structured by the classic scene. Step 2 consists of practicing how to structure everything beyond the classic scene using it as a stylistic template. When you feel that things are getting away from you, do the first exercise, and then go back to blending networks of ideas to the classic scene. These two steps will get you through any problem in classic style.

Classic style depends absolutely on domesticating realities whose borders are necessarily vague: jealousy, resentment, regret. They are never directly perceptible and can be managed in thought and language only if we treat them as what we know they are not. When we talk about「putting aside our resentment,」no one is fooled into thinking that we can move our resentment out of the way as if it were a bicycle in the driveway, but if we try to handle the metaphysical character of resentment without anchoring it in something perceptible, we will be unable either to grasp the thought or to match it to language. Turning resentment into a physical object is a cognitive compression. Cognitive compression happens routinely in blending and can turn unwieldy conceptual ranges into manageable scenes. An entire mental network supporting expression can be blended mentally with the classic scene, to create a stylistic anchor for the expression. The network might involve any amount of complexity. Here is an example: In Life on the Mississippi, Mark Twain is writing for an unseen and indefinite audience about his boyhood experience growing up on the Mississippi before the Civil War. Classic style treats the invisible, indefinite audience as a person, treats the writing as speech, and treats「boyhood experience」in this time and place that no longer exist as if it were something directly perceptible, a thing with a definite shape, a definite texture, definite borders. This is a virtuoso, and classic, cognitive compression.

You are already a master at using simple scenes to domesticate conceptual ranges that cannot — in their undomesticated state — be held in mind. When you do that, you produce simpler, structured versions of those conceptual ranges. Language is the instrument par excellence for guiding us to that kind of structuring. In our experience, blackbirds are quite different from aspirations, but grammatically,「blackbirds」and「aspirations」belong to the same category. Nouns like confidence, religion, nation, aspiration, and money already prompt us to structure complicated concepts as things. In the structured version, they are all things that you can recognize. Single words prompt for simple structuring. So do larger grammatical constructions. Consider「Acid destroys metal,」「Acid eats metal,」or「Acid etches metal.」These sentences prompt us to conceive of the acid as an agent and the metal as a patient. In fact, as we all know, there is a chemical reaction between the acid and the metal, and the metal is as much a cause of this chemical reaction as the acid. The grammar prompts us to seize upon a simpler version of a complex thought; the structured version depends upon a universally accessible scene, a causal scene in which an agent acts on something passive, like a sculptor working on marble.

Blending, compression, and anchoring are the heart and soul of vocabulary and grammar. In the Studio, you are extending your abilities for blending, compression, and anchoring beyond simple vocabulary and grammar to communication, especially writing. You are learning to blend a complex mental network supporting expression with a simple scene of classic joint attention. That classic scene offers a clear and direct way of communicating about a clear and direct subject of presentation. These exercises are all moves toward learning how to blend any such network involving anything and anyone with that classic scene.

EXERCISE 6: Surfing

This exercise has five parts. In all of them, keep these features from the classic scene:

You are with a companion. You speak and gesture.

You point out something to your companion that is directly perceptible.

In addition, keep a feature you practiced in exercise 2:

Whether or not your recognition is spontaneous, present it in the same way in which classic style presents a spontaneous recognition.

But now, you are dealing with scenes that go beyond the scene of exercise 1.

In the five parts of this exercise, we use colloquial terms to mark different sources of knowledge: notably, direct perception, inference, judgment, prediction, cultural knowledge, and belief. Scientifically and philosophically, it is impossible to draw a line between perceptual knowledge and knowledge that comes from other sources, but for what follows, assume the commonplace distinction between every pair of such sources of knowledge. The goal of exercise 6 is not to create a consistent classification of sources of knowledge, but to acquire a smooth facility in moving back and forth across all such sources with no variation in the style and without marking the move from one to another.

In all five parts of this exercise, try using a single list of subjects. We provide one that has been road-tested:

a natural nonliving object

a manufactured nonliving object

a plant

an animal

a landscape

food

a work of art

a person

an interaction between two people

a public space

In the five parts of this exercise,

surf across perceptions and inferences

surf across perceptions and judgments

surf across perceptions and predictions

surf across perceptions and cultural knowledge

surf across perceptions, inferences, judgments, predictions, and cultural knowledge

The style never varies.

PART 1: Inferences

For each item on your list, present something that is directly perceptible joined with some associated inferential knowledge. In our own examples, because the style elides the distinction, we have used italics to indicate the features that cannot literally be perceived. We have provided analyses for the first three examples, because a smooth elision can go unnoticed although it becomes quite obvious with practice.

A natural nonliving object: The banded rocks are formed by sedimentation. You can see the rocks; you can see that they are banded; but you cannot see the millions of years of geological sedimentation that produced the rocks and their bands. The sedimentation is no longer happening. Although the distinction here is neither nuanced nor subtle, the style elides the distinction. It is as if the sedimentation were as perceptible as the rocks.

A manufactured nonliving object: Any owner who recognized that sound would have the slipping fan belt in that roadster fixed. You can hear the sound and see the roadster. It is an inference that the sound comes from a slipping fan belt. It is an inference that the owner does not recognize the sound because otherwise he would have had it fixed.

A plant: our struggling lemon tree needs less water and a little fertilizer. It might take an expert to infer from the lemon tree's appearance that it is struggling, and certainly that what it needs is less water and a little fertilizer. But these inferences are presented in the same way the directly perceptible lemon tree is presented.

An animal: The cliff squirrels, starved by the drought, have extended their range looking for food.

A landscape: The sand berms have been bulldozed up to stop the winter waves from eroding the sandstone cliffs.

Food: The harder goat cheese has been aged longer. Moisture leaves the cheese over time.

A work of art: The helmeted woman leaning on her spear in this stele is Athena, the warrior goddess, protector of Athens.

A person: She has the strong wrists and forearms of a pole vaulter or a gymnast.

An interaction between two people: The host and the chef are joking with each other with the familiarity that comes of being married for thirty years.

A public space: There is only one person running the flower shop. Business has returned to winter levels.

PART 2: Judgments

For each item on your list, present something that is directly perceptible joined with an associated judgment.

A natural nonliving object: A big wave gets thinner as it walls up. Just before it breaks, the sunlight comes through for a moment, turning it an exhilarating green.

A manufactured non-living object: The reflective green of the surfboard clashes with the translucent green of the wave.

A plant: Monterey Pines do not look so beautiful toppled over by the storm.

An animal: The adorably playful sea otters in the bay are actually banging abalone open to eat them.

A landscape: A small port town on an island in the Cyclades, with its deep blue water, white-walled buildings, and pure sunlight, is the place to send someone if you want to learn whether he is crazy or merely disturbed. Anyone who can stay disturbed there really does have a problem.

Food: The marvelous beef tacos here at the seaside burrito shack are taken for granted by the locals.

A work of art: To spend an hour walking through Victor Horta's house in Saint-Gilles is to understand the attraction of art nouveau architecture.

A person: He keeps missing the waves. His combination of athleticism, ambition, and indecision is lethal.

An interaction between two people: It's not his good looks that make her nervous. It's that she knows he would like her to find him good-looking.

A public space: The visitors to the row of antique shops do not see the fraud because they have made a commitment to a certain kind of experience. They are on holiday and want a good time.

PART 3: Predictions

For each item on your list, present something that is directly perceptible joined with an associated prediction.

A natural nonliving object: The west-northwest swell following this storm by a few days will have traveled thousands of miles. A swell like that loses much less of its energy than might be imagined as it travels long distances through weather.

A manufactured nonliving object: These houses are future beach sculpture, once the sandstone cliffs give way.

A plant: These pears will be ready to harvest in a month.

An animal: The mark of great racehorses is desire. Even in losing performances, they never just give up.

A landscape: When you are looking at the Swiss countryside through a train window, the occasional buildings look offensive.

Food: The price of the dinner includes the sense of well-being that lingers through the evening.

A work of art: The curator for Early Netherlandish paintings is depressed in anticipation of the inevitable damage to the fragile panels scheduled to be lent to an exhibit in New york.

A person: Her otherwise serene and beautiful mother is helpless trying to postpone her daughter's imminent descent into the long, dark tunnel of adolescence, in which bitterness, resentment, and sullen ingratitude are the power chords of emotional life.

An interaction between two people: His effervescence will evaporate after the initial impression wears off.

A public space: improving the neighborhood will destroy its historic charm.

PART 4: Cultural Knowledge

For each item on your list, present something that is directly perceptible joined with an associated aspect depending on cultural knowledge.

A natural nonliving object: No political or financial scheme has blurred the sharp division of rich and poor Chicago at the river.

A manufactured nonliving object: Despite indicating episcopal dignity, a mitre makes all but the most regal bishops look ridiculous.

A plant: Tea is the wine of China. It even has some of wine's sacramental character.

An animal: Horses are no longer an instrument of war, but they have not been displaced as a symbol of power.

A landscape: The English addiction to the hills of Tuscany as the earthly paradise has always been a puzzle to the italians.

Food: Both traditional French cooking before it and current techno-cuisine after it reject the principle of nouvelle cuisine that great cooking should never mask natural savors.

A work of art: James Ensor, the only artist of the late nineteenth century who did great original religious painting, and whose Entrance of Christ into Brussels in 1889 was acquired by the Getty Museum in Brentwood to serve as the culmination of its collection, is famous instead for his grotesques.

A person: Tony went to Flanders to study medieval architecture, but ended up spending most of his time surfing in Ostende.

An interaction between two people: She was promoted because, as a server, she was the best presence the dining room had ever deployed, despite her tenuous grasp on the otherwise adamantine principle that servers must not flirt with diners because it distracts from the food.

A public space: Despite the great reputation of the experience, seeing the Piazzetta di San Marco as you arrive by boat is never a disappointment.

PART 5: Safari

For each item on your list, present something that is directly perceptible joined with any combination of associated inferences, judgments, predictions, cultural knowledge, beliefs, or any other such commonplace category.

EXERCISE 7: Classic Style without Borders

PART 1: A New List

We offer another road-tested list, below. Here is the exercise: For each of the items on the list, present something that is directly perceptible, along with associated inferences, judgments, predictions, cultural knowledge, beliefs, and anything else that is not directly perceptible.

an article of casual clothing

an architectural feature

a piece of furniture

a uniform

a passage of music

a physical sensation

a taste

an electronic device

a piece of luggage

an actor engaged in a performance

PART 2: Another New List — Your Choice

When you have finished your exercises with this second list, move on to invent your own list of ten categories. You will find possibilities everywhere. Consider a photograph of someone's face. When you see one, it is almost impossible to resist forming a quick sense of the character of the subject. Of course, all you can see is the photograph. But a classic presentation of the photograph can include inferences, judgments, predictions, cultural knowledge, in fact recognition of any sort. Raymond Chandler's Marlowe, the detective in The Big Sleep, is shown a photograph of a man he is looking for:「He pushed a shiny print across the desk and I looked at an Irish face that was more sad than merry and more reserved than brash. Not the face of a tough guy and not the face of a man who could be pushed around much by anybody. . . . A face that looked a little taut, the face of a man who would move fast and play for keeps.」Here is the exercise: Invent your own list of ten categories, and then, for each item, do what you did in exercise 6. Enjoy the waves.

EXERCISE 8: Describing Is Not Presenting

Exercises 6 and 7 focused on blending any subject with a directly perceptible object. Now we turn to blending any purpose with presentation. The nature of presentation is fully discussed in the Essay and exemplified in the Museum. Recall that in presentation, writers take responsibility for everything. The reason writers speak in classic style is to present something they judge to be worthy of presentation. In particular, in classic style, writers are not following orders or a template.

In this exercise, we refine our concept of presentation by contrasting it with a different purpose, one with which it is often confused — description. Although the term「description」is elastic, it is quite different from what we mean by「presentation.」Description, as we use the term, is a performance in which the speaker is a delivery device. In some cases, the speaker performs a monitoring service, giving a running account of the salient features of a subject, the way an announcer might for a sporting event. In others, the speaker fills in a pre-existing template. In all cases, the speaker follows a protocol that comes from someone else. A description is inadequate if it leaves out part of this protocol. Presentation, by contrast, is something for which an individual is entirely responsible — responsible for what is included and for what goes unmentioned. A presentation may have uses, but its goal, stylistically, is not utilitarian. If you describe a painting, for example, the painting's dimensions are essential, as is its support (panel or canvas). This is the sort of information you expect to find in a descriptive catalogue. In a presentation, these features could conceivably be included, but they needn't be.

When Julien Green offers a presentation of the Ghent Altarpiece, he deals with just one of that polytych's panels. If your knowledge of the altarpiece were limited to the details that Green chooses to present, you would have no idea that it consists of a dozen sections when open and nine others when closed. You would have no idea that it is an oak panel with wings and that the wings are painted on both sides. If Green's presentation were meant to be a description, it would be completely inadequate, but he is not working for the editor of a catalogue; he is offering what he finds worth presenting. What Green says in his presentation is informed by his distinctive imagination and intelligence. What he presents can be seen once he has presented it, but it is not necessarily what someone else in his place would find worth presenting. If a professional art historian or curator were offering a description of the painting, it would be identical to what any other competent professional would offer as a description. You would be able to recognize the painting from the description just the way you would be able to recognize a book from a description in a rare book dealer's catalogue.

It is not yet time to start writing, but in this exercise, while as always retaining the scene of classic joint attention as the anchor of the network, give up actually being next to your listener. Here is the exercise: Call someone on the telephone, or through some kind of voice chat, and in the course of the conversation describe something you can see. Then call someone and in the course of the conversation present the same thing. The two activities should feel very different.

This exercise is intended to draw a distinction between presentation and description. You can repeat the exercise — first description, then presentation, until you command the difference — by choosing different items on the lists used in previous exercises. You might first choose a concrete, definite, visible object, like a chair. Then advance along a scale: a tree, a bird, a dress, the way a particular animal moves, the way a particular person talks, a local environment — such as Mount Vernon Square in Baltimore — , a city, someone's character, a legal concept such as perjury.

EXERCISE 9: Conversations

Here is the exercise: When you are with a companion, recall a conversation you had with her in the past. Present it in classic style. Notice that it is normal to treat this previous conversation as something present, something that you and your companion can jointly see, even though each of you is dealing with a separate memory, a separate mental representation, which can be and probably is quite different for each of you. The basis of classic style is that any scene of communication can be blended with the classic scene to bring it to intelligible and congenial human scale. You are familiar with this sort of blending, and often do it without thinking about it, as in the case of recalling and presenting the conversation. What this exercise asks you to do is something you have been doing practically all of your life. It is a simple step from presenting a perception (「The blackbird on the tree limb has red markings on its wings」) to the presentation of a memory (「Your response to my suggestion two days ago that we go away for the weekend was unexpected」). You can see both the blackbird and the red markings, but both the response and its unexpected nature, although they can be presented in the same style as the blackbird and its markings, are unavailable to perception. Consistent classic style requires recognizing that these features lie beyond the classic scene, yet domesticating them by anchoring them in that scene.

EXERCISE 10: Stealth Argument

Classic style characteristically avoids explicit argument and never seems to press for agreement since it is structured by a scene where neither argument nor urgency has a place. Your project is to accomplish the goals of argument by what is ostensibly simply presentation. If you ask a companion to notice an owl whose coloring makes it difficult to distinguish the owl from the tree and the foliage where it is perched, you don't have to persuade your companion that the owl is actually there; she can see it for herself as soon as she knows where to look. When classic stylists are interested in persuasion, they engage in a kind of stealth argument that is conducted as if it is simply presentation. In the Museum, we analyzed argument-as-presentation in Descartes, in Mark Twain's discussion of the experience of war, in Liebling's dismissal of the BBC's account of the Normandy Invasion, and in the Smithsonian presentation of the dragoon tie, where commercial motives are disguised as art historical presentation. Andrew Hodges on Alan Turing, Junichir Tanizaki on Terukatsu, Jane Austen on Mr. Collins, and La Rochefoucauld on Madame de Chevreuse all engage in argument as presentation. Here is the exercise: Review these passages and then offer a similar stealth argument of your own.

EXERCISE 11: Arrivals and Departures

Many situations impose a style — contractually or by convention. An official conducting a marriage must do so according to a protocol, and fulfill that protocol. These situations arise in life as soon as one represents a group. A child selling cookies may say,「Hello, we belong to Girl Scout Troop 27, and we are selling cookies to raise money for a field trip to the Getty Museum where we will earn our visual arts badges.」This is extremely unclassic, and all the participants in the conversation probably know that the Girl Scout has been taught to say exactly this. But when the Girl Scout is asked about the differences in the kinds of cookies, she may switch into classic style. After her classic presentation, she may switch back into the scripted sales conversation in order to complete the transaction, thank the customer, and otherwise create goodwill. Switching into and out of the classic scene serves a great range of situations, from selling Girl Scout cookies to presenting a case before the Supreme Court. Such situations often come with a scripted protocol. The moments that serve the protocol are highly unclassic because they are formal and because they are imposed. Yet the speaker or writer can switch into and out of classic style and keep the protocol to a minimum. The result can be a piece that has all the required parts but still feels classic most of the time.

In official style, the speaker is the agent of a system. A passport controller at the Brussels airport, for example, after asking the required questions about your travel plans, may drop straight into classic style.「What is the purpose of your trip?」「cultural. I want to see the James Ensor paintings in Antwerp.」「You won't be disappointed. Ensor lived in Ostende, but his best paintings are in Antwerp.」

Suppose two people are interviewing you for a job. This is an encounter so complex, unfamiliar, and difficult to navigate that many people find it paralyzing. The actual cast and purpose are far from classic. The scene can induce terrible anxiety; efforts to control it are often immediately apparent to the interviewers. But the job interview can be done in classic style. It just happens that what you are presenting is yourself, but in the way you would present the blackbird. You are pointing out what you expect the interviewers to recognize once you show them where to look. When asked,「So, what did you do in college?」you answer,「I divided my time between molecular genetics and surfing.」The exercise is to carry out a job interview in classic style. The reader of the Studio might not have the opportunity to do this assignment in the field. But it can be done in imagination, or with a friend, as a mock interview. Similarly, a letter of application for a job falls into a protocol. If it does nothing more than follow that protocol, it will be impossible to distinguish it from a hundred others. There is a real advantage in being able to include a passage in classic style even in this most unclassic situation. The situation need not — and usually should not — dictate the style.

Here is the exercise: Begin in a nonclassic style — official style or practical style, for example — and then switch out of it into classic style.

EXERCISE 12: Talking to Strangers

We began with the scene of classic joint attention, which has a cast of two. This scene and its cast anchor classic style, although in most forms of writing and in many forms of broadcast speech the audience could consist of any number of people, known or not, visible or not. Any audience is treated as if it were a single individual. Consider Alec Guinness's speech accepting an honorary Academy Award, in which he wittily presents the defining moment of his formation as a film actor. (You can find it on YouTube.) Although his speech sounds informal, there are many reasons to think it has been carefully prepared: there are no false starts or awkward sentences, grammatical mistakes, syntactic bobbles, or hesitations. Contrast this to Dustin Hoffman's introduction. Sir Alec's intonation, cadence, and pace are perceptible; their preparation and his forethought are neither perceptible nor, at first, even evident. He sounds natural and spontaneous. Although he probably wrote his speech and memorized it, it sounds like conversation. He is talking to a group, but it sounds as if he is talking to one person — you. Of course, he doesn't call you by name, but the model for the interaction is one person addressing a companion.

Now, do the same thing. Here is the exercise: Make a presentation to a group of people, but anchor it in the classic scene, treating the group, stylistically, as an individual.

导语：

第一部分介绍了古典风格的原理，第二部分展示了古典风格作品及不同风格的对比赏析，到这里，我们已经具备了学会古典风格的全部必要知识，唯一缺的是实践了。于是我们为本书增加了第三部分 —— 古典风格工作室，这里有导师平等友善的引导，可以帮助初学古典风格的人渡过必然会写得磕磕碰碰的练习阶段，令初学者成长为自信而熟练甚至超越导师的写作者。

结语：

每一位伟大的艺术家都曾当过学徒，向才华远不如自己的老师学习基础知识。委拉斯开兹是一位比他的老师杰出得多的画家。牛顿是一位比他的老师杰出得多的数学家。如果不搭建基础知识框架，他们谁也不可能取得后来的成就。现在你已经搭建了一些关于写作的基础知识框架，也尝试了一些进阶练习，已经完成了本工作室提供的学徒训练。但艺术家从来没有真正离开过他们的工作室。他们不断深入学习基础知识，拓展运用范围。这种精进或拓展没有终点。假如说本工作室有一个终极训练，那就是抓住一切新机会，提升你对古典风格的应用能力，同时始终铭记你所呈现的要像真相一样清晰简单。

0701 写作基础练习：先练后说

7.1 古典联合注意与非古典思想网络

在工作室里，学生入门要先学基础，然后才会慢慢精通。本工作室部分要教的基础是一组通用练习 —— 通用是因为既可以用于说话也可以用于写作。我们从说话开始练习，因为古典风格写作根源于说话。

练习 1：古典联合注意

呈现的本质是认知科学家称为「联合注意」（Joint Attention）的场景。联合注意是一种熟悉且常见的场景，我们日常都有体验。在联合注意的场景中，人们在同一个地方关注同一件事情；他们知道彼此都在关注它，他们也知道因为共同关注，彼此之间建立了某种联系。他们在联合互动。他们可能比画着谈论那些吸引他们注意力的事物，但有可能实际上一句话都没说。他们相互影响着彼此的思想；言语可以提供帮助但不是必要的。联合注意不一定要有实际目标。重要的是要建立一种共同的交互注意力。

古典联合注意是一种最简单、最基本的联合注意。我们在原理篇和博览篇说过古典联合注意的特点：只有两个人，正观察着某些直接可见的东西，比如树上的一只乌鸦。它具备古典风格的所有特征：动机是真相，目的是呈现，场景非正式，语言充分，真相可知，说者和听者均能胜任，等等。这两个人不仅看到了同一只乌鸦，而且在同种包含相互之间影响的思维情境中看到了它。

因为古典联合注意太常见了，我们通常不会思考它，甚至都不会注意到它。但古典联合注意是古典场景，是古典风格的「锚」。要成为一个古典风格作者，必须能够有意识地思考古典场景，注意哪些真实场景可以对应古典场景，哪些相似，哪些背离，真实场景和古典场景之间有什么不同。没有这种古典场景做对照，写出来的风格会缺失风格之锚。自然，工作室的第一个练习是练习如何让自己沉浸到真实的古典场景中。

第一个练习如下：注意一些可直接观察的事情，口头呈现给身旁的同伴。你和你的同伴可以在任何地方练习：公园里、花园里、餐厅里、大街上、杂货店里、火车站候车处。原理篇提到向某人呈现某物不单是引起注意，如「看，有只乌鸦」，而是呈现你想让你同伴看到的事物。你希望你一指出来，你的同伴就能看到你在说的事物，如「篱笆边的树枝上站着一只乌鸦，每边翅膀都有一溜红色小条纹」。你可以呈现一个建筑细节之类的事物，一旦注意到很容易发现，但也很容易忽略。它不一定是视觉可见的东西，它可以是鸟鸣的旋律，或者是带着咸味的海风。

像工作室的所有练习一样，第一个练习适合在教室进行。找一个伙伴。观察房间、人、窗景、移动设备的声音和图像或任何在你观察范围之内的事物。可以让一个人播放幻灯片，展示大自然、建筑物、艺术作品、机场、城市景点、一部电影。开始与同伴对话，一边说一边做简短的古典呈现。可能一开始的对话听起来刻意、不自然，因为你正在有意识地做一些原先不假思素就会做的事情。练习过程中，不仅要听你同伴的声音，也要听你自己的声音。当你说话时，注意你自己在说什么。刚开始，这种有意识注意自己说话会令你犹豫甚至尴尬。坚持下去。最终你会越来越放松，直到自然而然地沉浸到古典联合注意的场景中，并用古典风格讲出来。老师可能希望将同学们带出教室散散步，去咖啡馆，逛城市街道，参观艺术博物馆或走进花园。走路时继续和你的同伴对话，抓住每次机会做古典呈现。

练习指导：非古典联合注意

学习有意识地关注古典场景，并在这种场景中呈现事物，是成为古典风格作者的第一步。但人类大部分交流因为各种原因超出了古典场景的范围。在任何一种交流行为中，你的心里都会有一个错综复杂的思想网络，这个网络太大、太细致、太复杂，以至于你无法同时思考。这个网络可能包括你自己的身份、他人的身份、过往经历、渴望、推测、判断、预测和各种文化知识，还有一系列参与者：你也许认为许多人此时在听你讲或将来会听你讲。也许在你的思想网络中，听众的个体之间有很大的差异。也许这个网络的参与者是未知的，甚至是虚构的或想象出来的。这个思想网终可能包含较长的时间间歇 —— 你正在回应某人一周前对亚伯拉罕·林肯的言论的批评，而你知道明天别人会评论你的回应。思想网络可能涉及漫长而复杂的因果链。它可能涉及不同甚至冲突的动机或目的。在这个思想网络中，你可能会想一些复杂的问题，比如你的表达如何被传达、接收和记住。当然，你思想网络中的主题 —— 你想谈论的事物 —— 和能直接看到的事物可能差异很大。你的思想尽力兼顾的所有事物，我们将其称作「思想网络」。这个网络可能接近也可能背离古典场景的想法。有些网络在某些方面接近，在其他方面背离。学习把任一种思想网络锚定在古典场景中，是成为古典风格作者的第二步。

当你身旁实际上有一位同伴，你看到一只在树上栖息的乌鸦，并向他呈现乌鸦的某些方面时，你正沉浸在古典场景中。但是现在假设你正在通过电话与同一个人说话，告诉他一些他不在场时你看到的东西。这种电话交谈，你用的正是某种特定的思想网络。它包含你想要呈现的东西、交流的方式、不同地方的另一个人、彼此见不着面的事实、观察和对话之间的延迟 —— 诸如此类还可以列出很多。打电话不属于古典场景。虽然两者的差异在你注意到时很明显，但一开始可能意识不到。一开始看不出两个场景属于两种类别，是因为我们构建电话交流场景时用到了古典场景。我们把前者锚定到后者中。即使实际场景不是古典联合注意场景，把我们的行为锚定到相应古典场景中，我们也能呈现事物。我们将一种思想网络 —— 比如我们认为自己身旁只有电话或电脑 —— 与我们的古典联合注意想法融合在一起。给某人写信不等同于直接和他对话。写作从来都不是古典场景。但给熟悉的人写信，自然会把信当作对话来写。这就是我们说的用一个场景（对话）构建另一个场景（写作）。从某种意义上说，我们把一个人在纸上写信的场景，看作两个人面对面说话的场景。简·奥斯汀写信给她姐姐时说：「我现在已经掌提了写信的真正艺术…...整封信我一直在同你说话，说得快极了。」1 写作并非说话，没有多少对话，但我们可以把写作锚定为我们理解的说话，甚至可以像写信一样，锚定为我们理解的双方对话时轮到其中一方说话。

把不完全是古典场景的思想网络与古典场景融合一起，这种融合方式是古典风格的基础。把我们看不见的事物（比如一个明显的失误）当成好像任何人都能「看到」，就是把判断当作看得见的东西的例子。判断在思想网络中，看得见的东西在古典场景中，我们将它们融合在一起，融合时从风格上把判断当作看得见的东西。日常交流中，我们一般很自然地用到古典风格，但如果我们没有有意识地注意古典场景和我们用它锚定非古典网络的方式，我们的表达就不一致、不可靠。在无意识的情况下，我们可能在古典场景和非古典场景之间相互切换，却不知道自己在做什么。结果是我们写出的风格不受我们控制，而且容易令读者困惑。古典风格作者请楚地知道哪些属于风格之锚，哪些属于思想网络，并将思想网络锚定到古典场景中。我们实际交流时的思想网络可能干变万化，但锚定场景 —— 古典联合注意 —— 从不会变化，正是这种风格之锚奠定了古典风格。

想象你坐在火车上，路过的是你从未见过的风景。下午时分，列车在某个乡村车站停留。你指着车窗外一棵树对同伴说：「那棵苹果树结了两种不同的果子。」这是一种古典联合注意的场最。现在想象你正在给你在家的同伴写信。你写道：「火车停在某个乡村车站。窗外的苹果树结了两种不同的果子，一种是斑驳的青色、另一种是红黄色。」这是锚定在古典联合注意场景中的古典风格。

接下来的每个练习的目标都是培养你识别非古典联合注意场景的能力以及从风格上把它们锚定到古典场景中的能力。

专门强调古典联合注意场景和那些仅由此构建出来的场景有哪些差异似乎没有必要，但认识这种差异对学习古典风格是必不可少的。在工作室，你学习了如何通过古典联合注意场景构建不同网络，而要做到这一点，你必须首先认识到发生的是什么。一旦你认识到，你就会注意它，并学习将思想网络锚定到古典场景中。如果你意识不到发生了什么，你要表达的东西会很难让人理解。认识到通过古典联合注意构建思想网络，意味着什么，是掌握古典风格最重要的一步。

练习 2：隐藏事前功夫

第二个练习在第一个练习的基础上做了一点小变化。你仍然在花园里，或走在街上，或在餐厅里，或正和别人一起听段音乐。你把同伴的注意力指向看得见的事物，但你让你的同伴注意的不是你自己刚刚注意到的东西，而是你早已知道的东西。当你引导你的同伴注意它时，你要表现得就像刚刚发现一样。你不需要解释自己是怎么注意到它的，或注意它多久了。它其实就在那里，可以被看到，你不用假装刚刚才注意到它，你只要把它指出来。你呈现的风格不要表现出你早就知道了。想象你站在你的冲浪板上经过碎波带，你的同伴站在他的冲浪板上离你五码（约 4.6 米）远。几年前你就知道海浪的形状会随着潮汐的变化而变化。而且你看了当天的冲浪报告，知道潮水正在退去。你说：「要退潮了。海浪正发生破碎，向更南边传播，并且更大。」潮水对海浪的作用虽然在指出来时非常明显，但是那种即使看到也不一定会注意到的事物，你自己并不是看一眼就知道了，这需要一个长期观察和了解的过程。你正在处理的思想网络不是古典联合注意场景，但你说的内容从风格上被锚定在那种场景中。

练习题：向你身旁的人呈现直接可见的事物，实际上你先前就已经注意到这件事了，但风格上不要表现出你早就知道了。

练习 3：即时推测

第三个练习需要你接下来关注推测。例如，你认为某人「看起来很失望」是你推测出来的。「失望」是一种推测而不是看见的事物，人们往往容易忽略这个事实。我们得提醒自己，「你可以看到他满脸的失望」这种日常说法实际上不是这样。矛盾的是，生活中一些看不见的推测被你无意识地当作看得见的东西 —— 但是现在，我们要你意识到你正在做的这件事，这样才能提升你对风格的运用能力。

练习题：向你身旁的人呈现看得见的事物，除此之外，这次还要呈现一个相关的推测，但风格上不要表现出这种变化。像呈现看得见的事物一样呈现推测。举个例子：「一只白鹭正一动不动地站在河口辅鱼。」你可以看到白鹭、河口、站立、一动不动，但你看不到捕鱼这个动作。

古典风格把推测与观察融合在一起了。

练习 4：预先推测

第四个练习：这是练习二和练习三的综合版本。仔细观察并思考某个场景，根据看得见的事物做出一个推测。然后，当你的同伴加入时，你的呈现风格不要表露出观察和推测的差异、观察与推测的顺序或推测依据的历史信息。举个例子：与你的住所隔一条街的地方，有一家带海景包厢的餐厅，你曾推测过它以前肯定是一个户外露台，现在被围了起来。你对一起吃饭的同伴说：「我们坐这里真幸运，刚好迎着海上的风暴。墙上有带盖子的电源插座是因为这个房间以前是露台。」

练习 5：观察一个人

第五个练习与第四个练习一样，但观察的是一个人。有很多无法直接看到的事物 —— 兴趣、失望和希望 —— 很多甚至无法一眼推测出来，需要花费一些时间。它们需要几番推敲才能有所推测。但是，正如我们在阐述古典风格的原则时所说，古典风格「不承认发现有过程和步骤，不承认需要修正和反复推敲」。由于古典风格不承认过程，本来实际上要花费很长一段时间，经历很多阶段和很多修正后才能得出的结果，在风格上呈现出来就像一只乌鸦一样，一眼就看能见。拉罗什福科要花多长时间了解谢弗勒兹夫人，才能说出她「光芒四射，集智慧、抱负和美丽于一身；她风情万千、活泼大胆、勇于开拓；她动用她全部的魅力，争取把事情办成功，在这过程中她几乎总是给那些她碰到的人带来灾难」？他若第一次见到她，不可能知道这些，但古典风格没有把注意力放在他是如何一步步了解她的。

每个人，经过一段时间后，都会注意到别人的气质、个性和性格等无法直接观察的特征。它们通常是一种潜移默化的观察。

练习题：你和你的同伴都在看一个人。介绍此人，包括呈现出需要慢慢观察才会注意到的东西。观察的对象可以是酒保、邮政员、你的中文老师、自行车修理铺的老板，或者如果你在教室做这个练习，可以观察室内的人或从这教室可以看到的人。要把推测包含进去。呈现你的观察结果时不要展示推测过程，在风格上也不要区分推测和观察。

练习指导：古典风格的两个步骤

现在你已经做了第一个基本练习和非典型古典联合注意场景的另外四个练习。在练习 2 至练习 5 中，你用古典场景构建因为各种原因与之不匹配的场景 —— 呈现的事物不能直接看见，或者不能当即发现。

这种模式 —— 沉浸到古典场景中，然后用它来管理非古典场景的网络 —— 是工作室的核心课程，因为这两个步骤是古典风格的全部艺术。

步骤一：有意识地沉浸到古典联合注意场景。在这第一步中，过去我们无意识、偶尔才做的事情，现在要学着有意识地、始终如一地做。

步骤二：学习如何将任何支持表达的思想网络与古典场景融合在一起，融合之后思想网络可以通过一种熟悉的风格之锚呈现出来。你可能不习惯把古典联合注意视为一般的「场景」；你可能无法始终如一地区分可以直接看见的事物（比如乌鸦）和不能直接看见的事物（比如荒诞感）。所以，当你让同伴注意某人的荒诞感时，尤其是那个人不在场时，你应该意识到你根本就不在古典联合注意的场景中。在之前的练习中，你已经从步骤一前往步骤二了。比如，当你呈现推测时，你在邀请你的同伴像观察看得见的东西那样观察你的结论。这个典型例子借助古典联合注意构建了不可见事物的呈现。

在写作时，你通常会觉得事物遥不可及。你没有弄错，事实上事物确实遥不可及。但是当你给身旁的人指出某个直接可见的事物时，你从不会觉得事物遥不可及。你在这种情况下感到轻松自然，因为古典场景本身清晰明白。在古典风格中，所有其他场景都会变得明白易懂、易于呈现，因为它们均由古典场景构建。步骤二练习的是如何以古典场景为风格模板构建古典场景之外的所有场景。当你感觉事物遥不可及时，做第一步练习，然后再回来把，思想网络融入古典场景中。古典风格中的任何一个问题，都可以用这两个步骤解决。

古典风格完全取决于圈定边界模糊的现实：嫉妒、怨恨、遗憾。你永远无法直接看到它们，只有把它们当作别的东西时（尽管我们知道它们不是），才能用思想和语言来表达它们。当我们谈论「放下怨恨」时，没有人会傻到以为我们可以将我们的怨恨像车道上的自行车一样搬走，但是如果我们要试图表达怨恨形而上学的特征，却没有将它锚定到可见的事物中，我们要么无法厘清思想，要么无法找到合适的语言表达。将怨恨转化为实物是一种认知压缩。认知压缩通常发生在融合的过程中，可以把难以驾驭的概念类事物变成易于呈现的场景。支持表达的整个思想网络可以在思想上与古典场景融合在一起，为表达创造一种风格之锚。这种网络涉及的事物复杂程度不一。

举个例子：在《密西西比河上的生活》这部作品里，马克·吐温对着一群看不见且不确定的读者，讲述南北战争前少年时代的他在密西西比州的成长经历。古典风格把不可见的、不确定的观众当作一个人，把写作当作说话，把此时此地不复存在的「少年时代的经历」当作可直接观察的事物：有确定的形状、确定的纹理、确定的边界。这是一种精妙的古典认知压缩。

现在你已经学会使用简单场景圈定概，念类事物 —— 如果未圈定就很难被理解。这样做可以为概念类事物构建出结构清晰的简化版本。语言是指导我们找到那种结构的最佳工具。在我们的经验中，乌鸦与愿望大不相同，但语法上「乌鸦」和「愿望」是同一类别。像信心、宗教、国家、愿望和金钱这样的名词可以帮助我们把复杂的概念构建为事物，它们被赋予结构后，都是可以识别的事物。单个的单词提示简单结构。相应地，语法结构越长概念越复杂。「酸会破坏金属」「酸会侵蚀金属」「酸会腐蚀金属」，这些句子提示我们把酸当作行为主体，把金属当作行为受体。众所周知，事实上，酸与金属会发生化学反应，而金属跟酸一样，都是引发这个化学反应的因素。我们通过语法来简化复杂思想的结构。这种结构化的版本包含人所共知的场景，这是一种因果场景，行为主体作用于被动事物，就像雕塑家雕刻大理石一样。

融合、压缩和锚定是词汇和语法的核心和灵魂。在工作室，你将你的融合、压缩和锚定能力从简单的词汇和语法逐渐拓展到沟通，尤其是写作。你正在学习将支持表达的复杂的思想网络与简单的古典联合注意场景融合在一起。古典场景提供一种清晰直接的沟通方式，来呈现清晰直接的事物。这些练习训练的是如何把这类网络与古典场景融合在一起，无论这类网络涉及什么事、什么人。

知识漫游

练习 6：知识漫游 1

① 原英文为「Surfing」，表示在不同事物之间切换，如「Intemet surfing」指网上冲浪，这里指古典风格的呈现从观察转换到推测、判断、预测、文化知识等非可见的知识来源或者任意二者相互转换，表达同等意思的还有「Safari」（本节练习 6 第 5 部分的标题），本意是「游猎」，也是苹果手机浏览器的名称，两个词在本书中者均译为「知识漫游」。—— 译者注

这个练习分五个部分。在所有练习里，都要遵循古典场景的特点：

你有一位同伴在身旁。你一边说话一边比画。

你向你的同伴指出某个可以直接看见的东西。

此外，保留你在练习 2 中练习的特点：

无论你是否当即认出某个东西，都要像古典风格呈现刚看到的事物一样呈现它。

但现在，你要开始处理练习 1 之外的场景。

在本练习的五个部分里，我们使用通俗的语言标注不同的知识来源：特别是直接观察、推测、判断、预测、文化知识和信仰。从科学和哲学的角度来看，知觉认识与其他知识来源很难划清界限，为便于理解接下来的练习，假定每组知识来源之间存在显而易见的差异。练习 6 的目标不是为知识来源创造统一的分类方法，而是为了热练掌握在所有这些来源之间自如切换的能力，同时保证风格恒定不变，从一种来源过渡到另一种来源不着痕迹。

试着用同一个主题列表逐一练习五个部分。我们提供一个反复测试过的列表：

1、一种无生命的自然物。

2、一种无生命的人造物。

3、一种植物。

4、一种动物。

5、一处景观。

6、一种食物。

7、一件艺术品。

8、一个人。

9、一次双人互动。

10、一处公共空间。

本练习五个部分的风格始终不变。

1、从观察漫游到推测。

2、从观察漫游到判断。

3、从观察漫游到预测。

4、从观察漫游到文化知识。

5、在观察、推测、判断、预测及文化知识之间任意漫游。

第 1 部分：推测知识

对于列表中的每项事物，呈现可直接观察的部分及相关的推测性认识。考虑到古典风格会弱化两者的差异，在我们自己举的例子中用斜体表明实际上看不见的特征。前面三个例子会附上分析，因为自然的过渡不易察觉，尽管刻意练习时很明显。

1、一种无生命的自然物：带状岩石通过沉积作用形成。

你能看到岩石；你能看到它们的条带形状；但是你看不到岩石和它们的带状成形所需的数百万年的地质沉积活动。沉积活动已不再发生。虽然这个差异没有细微到难以察觉，但古典风格弱化了这个差异，就好像沉积活动跟岩石一样可以观察。

2、一种无生命的人造物：任何一位车主听出那个声音，都会修好那辆敞篷跑车打滑的风扇传动带。

你可以听到声音并看到这辆敞篷跑车。声音来自打滑的风扇传动带是一种推测。车主没有听出这声音也是一种推测，因为他若听出就会把它修好了。

3、一种植物：这棵挣扎着的柠檬树要少浇水多施肥。

可能只有专家才能从柠檬树的外观中推断出它正在挣扎，以及它必须少浇水多施肥。但这些推测呈现的方式和呈现可直接现察的柠檬树一样。

4、一种动物：一只在悬崖边活动的松鼠，因为干旱饥渴难耐，扩大了觅食范围。

5、一处景观：为了防止冬季海浪侵蚀砂岩峭壁，沙堤已被推平。

6、一种食物：那块较硬的山羊奶酪放久了。放久后水分会流失。

7、一件艺术品：石碑上戴头盔、倚长矛的女人是战神雅典娜，雅典的保护神。

8、一个人：她有撑竿跳高运动员或体操运动员的强壮手腕和前臂。

9、一次双人互动：主人和厨师之间互相开玩笑，熟得像结婚三十年的恋人一样。

10、一处公共空间：只有一个人经营着花店，生意回到了冬季水平。

第 2 部分：判断知识

对于列表中的每项事物，呈现可直接观察的部分及相关的判断。

1、一种无生命的自然物：一个巨大的海浪越往上砌越薄。在它即将破裂的时候，有一会儿阳光穿过其中，将它变成兴奋的绿色。

2、一种无生命的人造物：冲浪板反射的绿色跟波浪的半透明绿色很不协调。

3、一种植物：被狂风暴雨刮倒的蒙特利松树，看起来没那么美丽。

4、一种动物：海湾中调皮可爱的海獭，其实正在把鲍鱼敲开来吃。

5、一处景观：基克拉迪群岛上的港口小镇，有深蓝色的海水、白色的建筑和纯净的阳光。你要想知道一个人是精神压力大还只是焦虑，就让他来这个地方。无论是谁，到这里后仍然焦虑不安，那是真遇上问题了。

6、一种食物：在海边的饼摊吃到美味的墨西哥牛肉卷饼，在当地人看来理所当然。

7、一件艺术品：花上一个小时去圣吉尔维克多·奥塔的房子走一圈，看看新艺术派建筑的魅力。

8、一个人：他总是错过风头。他的运动天赋、踌躇满志与优柔寡断是一种致命的组合。

9、一次双人互动：不是因为他帅气的面孔让她紧张。而是因为她知道他希望她看到他的帅气。

10、一处公共空间：古玩一条街的游客们，没看到这里的猫腻，因为他们铁了心要感受某种体验。他们在度假，期待度过一段美好的时光。

第 3 部分：预测知识

对于列表中的每项事物，呈现可直接观察的部分及相关的预测。

1、一种无生命的自然物：经过这场暴风雨之后，西北偏西的海浪在接下来几天，将流经数干里。在天气的作用下，像那样的海浪流远之后，损失的能量比想象中要少得多。

2、一种无生命的人造物：一旦没有砂岩峭壁的阻挡，这些房子就成了未来的海滩雕塑。

3、一种植物：这些梨一个月后就能采摘了。

4、一种动物：优秀的赛马的标志是欲望，即使体力不支，它们也绝不放弃。

5、一处景观：当你坐在火车内看向窗外欣赏瑞士乡村时，偶尔出现的几处建筑显得格格不入。

6、一种食物：晚餐的价格包含整个晚上的幸福感。

7、一件艺术品：早期尼德兰画作的展厅负责人想到画作要被借到纽约参展有些沮丧，担心脆弱的画框不可避免会损暇。

8、一个人：平静而美丽的母亲无奈不能延缓女儿即将堕入狭长黑暗的青春隧道，在这条隧道里，悲痛、愤恨和阴郁的仇恨是情感生活的重力和弦。

9、一次双人互动：第一印象过去后，他的热情将会消退。

10、一处公共空间：改善周边环境将破坏它的历史魅力。

第 4 部分：文化知识

对于列表中的每项事物，呈现可直接观察的部分及相关文化知识。

1、一种无生命的自然物：没有哪个政治或金融方案削弱了两岸芝加哥居民悬殊的贫富差距。

2、一种无生命的人造物：尽管主教冠能展示主教的尊严，但除非是最庄严的主教，任何其他主教戴上它都显得荒谬可笑。

3、一种植物：茶是中国的葡萄酒。它甚至有葡萄酒的某些神圣特性。

4、一种动物：马不再是一种战争工具，但它们作为权力象征仍未被取代。

5、一处景观：英国人对托斯卡纳山痴迷到把它当作人间天堂，一直让意大利人感到费解。

6、一种食物：它之前的传统法国菜和它之后现行的技术派法国菜都摈弃了新式法国菜的原则 —— 一道好菜不应该掩盖食材固有的味道。

7、一件艺术品：詹姆斯·恩索尔是十九世纪晚期唯一一位画过伟大的原创宗教题材的艺术家，他的作品《1889 年基督进入布鲁塞尔》被收入布伦特伍德的盖蒂博物馆，成为该馆最有代表性的收藏品，但该作品因其怪诞而出名。

8、一个人：托尼去佛兰德斯学习中世纪建筑，但最后却花费了大部分时间在奥斯坦德冲浪。

9、一次双人互动：她获得了晋升，因为她是这家餐厅历任服务员中最出色的一位，尽管她没有严格遵守服务员不能跟客人调情打扰客人用餐这条硬原则。

10、一处公共空间：尽管这种观光经历已颇负盛名，当你坐船来看圣马可广场时，你绝不会失望。

练习 7：古典风格没有边界

第 1 部分：一份新主题列表

下面是另一份经过测验的列表。

练习题：对于列表中的每项事物，呈现可直接观察的部分，以及相关的推测、判断、预测、文化知识、信仰及其他任何不可直接观察的事物。

1、一件休闲服装。

2、一种建筑特征。

3、一件家具。

4、一套制服。

5、一段音乐。

6、一种身体感觉。

7、一种味道。

8、一件电子设备。

9、一件行李。

10、一位正在表演的演员。

第 2 部分：另一份新主题列表（自选）

当你完成第二份列表的练习时，写出你自己的十个类别创建一份新列表，你会发现古典风格无处不在。比如一张某人脸部的照片。当你看到这样一张照片时，你几乎是不自觉地迅速反映出照片中的特征。当然，你能看到的只有照片。但古典风格的呈现可以包含推测、判断、预测、文化知识，事实上可包含任何一种认识。雷蒙德·钱德勒（Raymond Chandler）的作品《长眠不醒》（The Big Sleep）里的侦探马洛（Marlowe）看到一张照片，那上面正是他在找的一名男子：「他把一张反光的照片往桌面上一推，我看到一张爱尔兰人的脸，这张脸看起来欢乐实为忧伤，看起来傲慢实为拘谨。它不是一张铁汉的脸，也不是一张任人差遣的懦夫的脸…...他的脸看起来有些紧绷，是一个行动如风、为生计奔波的人的脸。」2

练习题：创建你自己的十个类别列表，然后每个类别都像练习 6 一样做。享受新一轮的练习吧。

综合应用

练习 8：描述不是呈现

练习 6 和练习 7 主要是练习把任一种主题和可直接观察的事物融合在一起。现在我们要把任何一种目的与呈现融合在一起。呈现的本质在原理篇已充分讨论过，在博览篇也进行了举例分析。可以回想一下，呈现时作者要对一切负责。作者使用古典风格说话，是为了呈现他们认为值得呈现的东西。尤其在古典风格中，作者不是按照指令或模版写作。







在这个练习中，对比另一个不同且容易混淆的目的「描述」，可以加深我们对呈现的理解。虽然「描述」这个词的含义很广，但与我们所说的「呈现」完全不同。我们所说的描述，是一种说话者充当信息传送者的活动。在有些场合，说话者会提供某种监测服务，持续介绍某个主题的重要内容，就像播报员播报体育赛事一样。在另一些场合，说话者只要补充预先设置好的模板。不论哪一种场合，说话者都要遵循别人指定的规范。如果遗漏这个规范的某部分，描述就不会充分。相比之下，呈现由个人全权负责 —— 讲什么、不讲什么都要为之负责。呈现可能有某些用处，但它的目标从风格上来说不是实用主义。比如，你要描述一幅画，画的尺寸与它的材料（画框或者画布）一样重要。你可以在描述性目录中找到这类信息，而呈现可以考虑纳入这些特征，但不是非要不可。

当朱利恩·格林（Julien Green）呈现根特祭坛画（Ghent Altarpiece）时，他只介绍了多联画屏的其中一联。如果你对祭坛画的认识仅限于格林选择呈现的部分细节，那么你不会知道它展开时由二十个部分组成，收拢时由其他九个部分组成。你不会知道它是一个侧翼双面上漆的橡木画框。如果格林的介绍是一种描述，那完全不够，但他不是为某个书画目录的编辑而工作的；他介绍的是他认为值得呈现的东西。格林在他的呈现中所说的内容，因他独特的想象和智慧被赋予了新信息。他呈现的内容一旦呈现出来，就能立即看到，但换成其他人站在他那个位置，就不一定认为他呈现的东西值得呈现。如果一位专业的艺术史学家或策展人描述这幅画，描述的内容将与任何其他称职的专家完全一样。你能够从描述中识别出这幅画，就像你能够从稀有图书经销商的目录描述中识别出一本书一样。

现在还没有到开始练习写作的时候，但在这个练习中，虽然仍然保留古典联合注意场景作为思想网络的风格之锚，但你身旁没有人。

练习题：通过电话或某种语音聊天方式联系一个人，对话时描述你可以看到的东西。然后联系另一个人，对话时呈现同样的事物。这两种活动应该感觉非常不同。

本练习的用意是区分呈现和描述。你可以重复这个练习 —— 先描述，再呈现，直到能区分二者 —— 选择前面练习的列表中的不同类别练习。你可以先选择一个具体、明确、可见的物体，比如一把椅子。然后逐步深化练习：一棵树、一只鸟、一件衣服、一种特定动物移动的方式、一个特定人物谈话的方式、一种当地环境（比如巴尔的摩弗农山广场、一座城市、某人的性格、一种法律概念（比如伪证）。

练习 9：回忆对话

练习题：当你和同伴在一起时，回想一下你过去与他的一次对话。用古典风格呈现那段对话。把先前的对话看成正在发生的事情，你和你的同伴能共同看到，注意这是很正常的事情，尽管你们两个处理的是各自单独的记忆、单独的心理表征，可能且很有可能跟彼此的大不相同。古典风格的基础是，任何一种交流场景都可以与古典场景融合在一起，放到人类可以理解和接受的范围内。你很熟悉这种融合方式，并且常常在无意识中这样做，就像呈现回忆中的对话一样。这个练习你要做的实际上是你日常生活中一直在做的事情。从呈现观察（树枝上的那只乌鸦两边翅膀上有红色标记）到呈现记忆（我两天前建议我们周末去远游，你的回应令人意外）。你可以同时看到乌鸦和红色标记，但无法观察到「回应」和回应让人感到「意外」这种性质，虽然呈现它们的风格与呈现乌鸦和红色标记一样。古典风格的一致性要求意识到这些特征不属于古典场景，但要把它们锚定到那个场景中圈定它们。

练习 10：隐形论证

古典风格总是避免明显的论证，而且似乎从来不急于达成一致意见，因为构建它的场景无须论证，也无须紧迫。你要达到论证目的，显然只需做好呈现。你看到一只栖息在树上的猫头鹰，它自身的颜色使它融入树和枝叶中难以区分，如果你要指给你的同伴看，你不需要向你的同伴证明猫头鹰实际就在那里；他只要知道看向哪里就会自己看出来。古典风格作者想要说服时，他们会使用一种隐形论证，写得好像只是呈现而已。在博览篇，我们列举了不同例子分析「呈现式论证」，包括笛卡儿的方法论，马克·吐温描述的战争经历，李伯龄不屑提及英国广播公司播报的诺曼底入侵事件，以及史密森尼博物馆介绍的龙骑士领带把商业动机伪装成艺术历史。霍奇斯写的艾伦·图灵、谷崎润一郎写的辉胜像、简·奥斯汀写的柯林斯先生以及拉罗什福科写下的谢弗勒兹夫人都是呈现式论证。

练习题：复习以上这些段落，然后写一段自己的隐形论证。

练习 11：风格切换

许多场合因为某些要求或惯例要用到指定的风格。主持婚礼的公职人员必须遵循场合规范，并实现这种规范。当一个人要代表一个群体时，生活中会出现这些情境。一个卖饼干的孩子可能会说：「您好，我们属于女童子军第二十七队，我们在卖饼干，为实地参观盖蒂博物馆筹钱，在那里我们会获得我们的视觉艺术纪念章。」这种交流非常不古典，所有与女童子军说话的人可能都知道她们说的这些话是组织者教的。但是，当女童子军被问及不同种类的饼干有什么差别时，她们可能会切换到古典风格。结束古典风格的介绍后，为了完成交易她们可能又会回到读稿式的推销对话，感谢客人，或用其他方式表示友好。从卖女童子军饼干到向最高法院提起诉讼，很多场合会在古典场景与非古典场景之间切换。这些场合常常有书面规范。遵守规范的时候非常不古典，因为它们很正式，而且是强行规定的。不过说话者或写作者可以在古典风格和非古典风格之间切换，将规范减到最少。这样一来，一段话即使保留规定的部分，大多时候仍然感觉是古典风格。

在官方风格中，说话者是某种体系的代理人。例如，布鲁塞尔机场的护照管理员，对你的旅行计划提出规定的问题后，可能会直接进入古典风格。「你的旅行目的是什么？」「文化旅游。我想去安特卫普看詹姆斯·恩索尔的画。」「你不会失望的。恩索尔住在奥斯坦德，但他最好的画在安特卫普。」

假设有两个人对你进行工作面试。这种场合既复杂又陌生，而且很难掌控，许多人会不知所措。实际的角色和目的都不是古典风格。这种场景会引起糟糕的焦虑；你想控制它的表现常常会被面试官察觉。但工作面试也可以使用古典风格。只是这回你呈现的是你自己，呈现的方式要像你呈现乌鸦一样。一旦你告诉面试官看向哪里，你就相当于指出你希望他们看到的东西。当被问道：「那么，你在大学里做了什么？」你回答说：「我的时间都花在分子遗传学和冲浪上了。」

练习题：进行一场古典风格的工作面试。工作室的读者可能没有机会参加现场面试。但可以想象着做，或者和朋友模拟面试。同样，一份求职信也是一种规范。如果它只是遵循规范，那么它很难从另外一百份求职信中脱颖而出。因此，即使是这种最不古典的场合，用古典风格表达也有实际的优势。情境不一定 — 通常也不应该 — 一指定风格。



练习题：先从非古典风格开始 —— 比如官方风格或实用风格 —— 然后从这种风格切换到古典风格。

练习 12：对一群陌生人讲话

我们从由两个角色组成的古典联合注意场景开始。这个场景和它的角色锚定了古典风格，虽然在大多数形式的写作以及多种形式的广播演讲中，听众的人数没有限定，听众可以是已知的，也可以是未知的，可以是看得见的，也可以是看不见的。无论什么样的听众，他们都被看作单独的个人。我们看一下亚历克·吉尼斯（Alec Guinness）接受奥斯卡终身成就奖时的致辞，他风趣地呈现了那段把他塑造为电影演员的重要时期（你可以在 YouTube。上找到这个视频）。尽管他的发言听起来不正式，但有很多理由认为它是经过精心准备的：他的发言没有错误的开头或尴尬的句子，没有语法或句法上的错误，也没听出犹豫不决。与达斯汀·霍夫曼（Dustin Hoffman）的致辞对比，你能听出亚历克爵士的语调、抑扬顿挫和节奏；你看不出来他们提前做过准备和思考，甚至一开始一点都不明显。他的话听起来是自然的即兴发言。虽然他可能事先写了讲稿并熟读于心，但它听起来像对话。他和群人说话，但听起来他好像只跟一个人说话一你。当然，他不会直接叫你的名字，但是他与听众互动的方式就像一个人在跟他的同伴说话。

现在，做同样的事情。

练习题：向一群人演示，但把这种演示锚定在古典场景中，在风格上把这群人当作单个的个体。

### Fundamentals: Write Second

If you have completed the common exercises in speech, you are probably ready to do them in writing. If you are wondering why there has been such a lengthy oral preliminary to the acquisition of a style of writing, our answer can be found in the opening paragraphs of this book. Writing is an intellectual activity. To achieve good prose styles, writers must work through intellectual issues, not merely acquire mechanical techniques. The heart of classic style is the root scene of classic joint attention. The actual scene of writing is blended with the classic scene so that writing is treated as speech. No matter how many people are addressed, no matter how indeterminate this「audience」is, no matter where they are, the style treats them as if they were a single person to whom the writer is speaking. Inferences, judgments, predictions, and cultural knowledge are treated as「things」that can be directly perceived. Neither the concept of classic joint attention nor an ability to blend an actual scene with the classic scene can be acquired simply by writing and then doing some local revision. Blending complex networks to the classic scene defines classic style, and while it is possible to acquire this ability through imitation of classic models, it is a chancy and inefficient path. In the Studio, we are offering a tested and secure path. If you work out the intellectual issues first, the activity of writing will be defined by a concept of style. You can then proceed with confidence.

You have already practiced the common exercises in speech. Now is the moment to observe that what works in speech cannot be directly transfered to writing. Go through the common exercises anew, this time in writing. We are not asking you to transcribe what you have already said, offering it in written form. Approach the exercises now with the resources of writing; do not cling to the resources of speech. Anchoring writing in speech is not pretending that writing is speech. Anchoring a mental network supporting expression in the classic scene is not pretending that you are in an actual classic scene; it is more subtle. It may sound paradoxical to say both that having done the speech exercises will help you to master a style of writing and that writing is a very different activity from speech because it lacks the resources of speech. But both are true and for a crucial reason: classic prose style blends speech with writing. A classic prose stylist must be able to supply by imaginative blending the structure of classic joint attention that the actual environment of writing lacks.

In what follows, we will add some comments on doing these common exercises in writing.

TUTORIAL: Blending Scenes

Writing is not a scene of classic joint attention, but in classic style the writer will use the classic scene as an anchor so that, in the blend, writing becomes speaking, the indefinite audience that is not present becomes a single person who is right there, and the subject becomes something that can be perceived. If writing is not a scene of classic joint attention, neither is reading — and writing, especially in classic style, assumes a reader, so it is part of the writer's task to induce the reader to anchor her activity in the classic scene as well.

Neither writer nor reader is deluded. They both know they do not share an environment they can refer to directly, but the writer anchors the actual scene to the classic scene in order to provide a consistent style.

TUTORIAL: Lost in Words

In writing, you lose the effects of the charm you may have in person. You lose the effects of gesture, proximity, warmth, intonation. In person, you can command and hold attention by being attractive, but all of that is gone in writing. All you have is the appeal of the presentation — the attraction of thought and of language. A speaker of some personal charm can give a pastiche of clichés the illusion of meaning, but in writing, a pastiche of clichés will always look like a pastiche of clichés. Presence is crucial to the classic scene. But in classic writing, there is no speaker, no shared environment, no interaction between speaker and listener. Presence must be supplied by the writing itself. Bernard Shaw, a dramatist who wrote his plays to be read, was especially sensitive to this distinction. He once remarked that there are fifty ways of saying the word「yes,」and five hundred ways of saying the word「no,」but just one way of writing them down.

TUTORIAL: Onset and Dismount

A written text has a beginning and an end — a first sentence and a last. Sections of writing have beginnings and ends too. Typically, speaking is not so discrete. When you drop into classic style in speaking, there may have been quite a bit of speech before it — greetings, small talk, and obligatory ceremonial questions and answers — and always after it the dribbling little bits of farewell, which the Viennese used to call「Goodbye without leaving.」Your first words are unlikely to be taken as the start of a coherent presentation. In classic prose, it is automatic. The first sentence is the onset. The last sentence, at least of the section, is the dismount. Crisp onset and dismount carry a premium in classic writing beyond their value in classic speech.

0801 写作基础练习：写为其次

如果你已经完成口头形式的通用练习，你可能准备好开始书面形式的练习了。如果你想知道为什么学习一种写作风格之前，需要做这么长时间的口头预备练习，答案可以在本书的开头几段找到。写作是一种脑力活动。要写出不错的风格，作者需解决思想问题，而不仅仅是学习机械的写作技巧。古典风格的核心是古典联合注意这一基础场景。写作的实际场景与古典场景融合在一起，所以可以把写作看作说话。无论要面向多少人，无论这些「读者」多么不确定，无论他们身在何处，古典风格都把他们当作与作者对话的一个个体。推测、判断、预测和文化知识被视为可以直接观察的「事物」。无论古典联合注意的概念，还是将实际场景与古典场景融合的能力，都无法通过单纯的写作和一些局部修改掌握。将复杂的网络融合到古典场景确立了古典风格，虽然模仿古典风格范例有可能获得这种能力，但这种方法不可靠而且低效。在工作室，我们提供了一种经过验证的可靠方法。如果你先解决思想问题，写作活动只是一种风格概念问题，然后就可以自信地写了。

你已经完成了口头形式的通用练习。现在是时候注意，适用说话的不一定直接适用写作。重新做一遍通用练习，这次写出来。我们不是让你把之前说过的话转录成书面形式，而是要用书面表达资源来做这些练习，不要依赖口头表达资源。将写作锚定到说话场景，不是假装写作就是说话。将支持表达的思想网络锚定到古典场景，不是假装你就在一个真实的古典场景中，实际情况要比这微妙得多。一方面，做这些口头表达练习将帮助你掌握一种写作风格；另一方面，写作因为缺乏口头表达资源与说话大不相同，这两种说法似乎相矛盾，但两者都能成立，且基于一个重要原因：古典文章的风格将说话与写作融于一体。一位古典风格作者肯定会借助想象力融合古典联合注意的结构，补足实际写作环境欠缺的东西。

接下来做书面形式的通用练习，我们会增加一些评论。

练习指导：融合场景

写作不是一种古典联合注意场景，但是在古典风格中，作者把古典场景用作风格之锚，所以锚定融合之后，写作变成了讲话，不在场的不确定观众变成了正在现场的个人，主题变成可以被观察的事物。如果说写作不是古典联合注意场景，那么阅读也不是一写作，尤其是古典风格的写作，会假想一个读者，因此作者的任务之一就是引导读者将他自己的活动也锚定在古典场景中。

作者和读者都不会上当。双方都知道他们并没有处在同一个可直接参照的环境中，但作者将实际场景锚定到古典场景可以保持风格一致。

练习指导：文字中的缺失

面对面交流的魅力，一旦用文字表达出来，就会消失殆尽。你无法表现手势、亲近、热情和语调。面对面时，你可以依靠个人魅力吸引和保持对方的注意力，但写作无法发挥这样的效果。你唯一可以发挥的就是呈现的魅力 —— 语言和思想的魅力。一位魅力无穷的人，即使重复陈词溢调，也会让它们听起来有意义，但在写作上，陈词溢调看起来永远都是陈词滥调。现场感对古典场景至关重要。但古典风格的写作，没有人说话，没有共同的环境，没有说者与听者的互动。写作本身需创造一种现场感。剧作家萧伯纳写剧本要能读出来，对这种细微差别特别敏感。他曾说过，有五十种方式说「是」这个词，有五百种方式说「不」这个词，但两个词都只有一种写法。

练习指导：开头和结尾

文章都有开头和结尾 —— 有第一句话，就有最后一句话。文章的章节也有开头和结尾。通常，说话不是东拉西扯，说话时，进入古典风格之前要说很多话 —— 问候、闲聊和必要的礼节性问答 —— 结束时又总会断断续续地说些零零碎碎的告别语，维也纳人曾经称为「告而不别」（Goodbye without leaving）。你开头的话不可能作为一个连贯呈现的开始。在古典文章中，默认第一句话就是开始。最后一句话，至少章节的最后一句话，代表着结束。干净利落的开始和结束对古典写作很重要，并且远超过它在古典讲话中的价值。

### Advanced Writing

Every classic stylist encounters novel situations. We explained in the Essay how some occasions call for a sequence of styles, or a blend of styles, or the development of a special style based on a general style. A style, after all, is defined by a coherent and consistent stand on the elements of style, expressed as a short series of questions about truth, presentation, writer, reader, thought, language, and their relationships. These questions are addressed to fundamental issues that must be answered deliberately or by default before we can write at all. Style is an intellectual matter of thinking through these questions in any situation. Someone who has worked through the curriculum of the Studio is equipped to recognize and work on new projects without further coaching by thinking through the elements of style and drawing on techniques learned in the Studio. In what follows, we suggest a few encounters with novelty.

EXERCISE 13: Sketchbook

Most of the writing instruction in the United States focuses on revision. This approach is fatal for the student attempting to master classic style. The essential ability of the classic stylist is to inhabit the style and to work within it. It is almost always a mistake to try to drag a piece of writing that was unclassic at its inception over rocks and through vegetation in a misconceived attempt to move it somehow to classic heights. Inhabiting the style means imaginatively blending the classic scene with the mental network supporting expression. The blend anchors the network and provides the stylistic structure. It is the platform from which the classic stylist works from beginning to end. The classic stylist learns to speak directly from inside that blend, even if the initial performances are weak. A piece conceived and written from within classic style can be improved, but no draft written without a settled style can be revised into classic style. The conventional advice to think of「style」as a final touch leads to disaster because style is not a surface decoration that can be added during revision. Style must be considered at the outset. Forget entirely the idea that「working on your writing」begins after you have something down on paper.

Consider that students in an art studio are often asked to take their sketchbook out into the field to do speed sketching. They see something and sketch it rapidly, never erasing but instead flipping quickly to a blank page to sketch something else. Later, they review their sketches, but they do not revise. In this Studio, the sketchbook exercise asks you to do in writing what the art student does in speed sketching. Here is the exercise: Recognize something in the field; step into classic style; present your recognition. Do not revise. Continue until you have ten prose sketches. As you begin to advance in your sketchbook exercises, you might move up, as you did in the common exercises, to subjects that are less and less directly perceptible, always blending them stylistically with what is directly perceptible. Once you have finished your ten speed sketches in classic style, put the work of your session aside. Review it later, but do not revise it. Tomorrow, do the sketchbook exercise again. A daily dose of the sketchbook exercise for a couple of weeks seems to have the power to move students rapidly. At first, they find this extremely difficult and seem to make no progress, but after a few days the style starts to come naturally. Some students get past their previous conditioning only after a couple of weeks of the sketchbook exercise has purged them of bad habits.

EXERCISE 14: Coherent Mixed Styles

It may seem paradoxical in a Studio devoted to classic style to include the study of styles that are only partially classic. But classic virtues can come from even a few classic ingredients, and the opportunity to deploy such mixed styles arises frequently. Instruction manuals have a practical motive, but they do not have to be impersonal; the cast can be collusive; the thought and language can be distinctive. The voice does not have to be one job description speaking to another. We can instead match a practical motive with a classic presentation, to produce a mixed style that might be called classic practical style, a style whose attraction and power do not depend exclusively on accomplishing a practical goal. Imagine reading a cookbook even if you have no intention of cooking. A cookbook in classic practical style might be attractive purely for the virtues of its classic presentation. There are many styles that can be mixed with classic ingredients to create an unmistakably classic flavor.

Here is the exercise: Pick a subject you understand well and write a「how-to」piece. The subject can be anything: how to identify a tree from its leaves, how to avoid probate, how to give a dinner party. The piece will be practical, of course, but experiment with the inclusion of classic ingredients. These classic ingredients might include a classic voice, a collusive cast, a full command of language, a crisp onset and dismount, truth as a complementary motive, presentation as a complementary purpose.

EXERCISE 15: Lists

Can a list be written in classic style? Of course. The material does not determine the style. The writer of a list could accept the stand of slavish adherence to a template, like a notary providing an inventory. But the writer can take the classic stand — someone recognizes something worth presenting to someone else. The writer can assume full responsibility for the selection.

A menu is a list, but if it is written in classic style, it can present the character and tradition of a restaurant and the nature of a cuisine. There is an owner, chef, or dining room manager standing behind the presentation. In classic style, neither the menu nor the wine list is a helter-skelter list of what happens to be available to eat and drink. A wine list can present the knowledge, culture, and taste of the sommelier. In the previous exercise, you practiced writing something in classic style that had an additional practical purpose. Menus and wine lists can similarly be written in classic style even though their ostensible purpose is practical. For someone interested in food and wine, a classic menu or wine list can be read for pleasure, even if the restaurant is a continent away or has been closed for years.

Menus and wine lists are only one example of lists that can take the classic stand and can accordingly be read and enjoyed independent of any practical goal. Georges Perec, in La vie mode d'emploi (Life A User's Manual), presents lists of the contents of basement storage lockers of an imaginary apartment building. Each is a masterful presentation in an individual voice not just of the items but also of the owner's habits, history, and character, and their cultural resonance. Here are two:

Bartlebooth's cellar:

In Bartlebooth's cellar there is some left-over coal on top of which still lies a black enamelled metal scuttle with a wooden grip fitted on its wire handle, a bicycle hanging on a butcher's hook, now unoccupied bottle racks, and his four travelling chests, four curved chests covered in tarred canvas, braced with wooden slats, with brass corners and hasps, and lined throughout with a sheet of zinc to ensure waterproofing.

The Rorschachs' cellar:

A bottle rack, wire, plastic-coated, is placed to the left of the slatted door. The lower level of the rack holds five bottles of fruit brandies: kirsch, apricot, quetsch, plum, raspberry. On one of the middle rows there is the score — in Russian — of Rimsky-Korsakov's version of Pushkin's Golden Cockerel, and a probably popular novel entitled Spice, or the Revenge of the Louvain Locksmith, with a cover depicting a girl handing a bag of gold to a judge. On the top row, a lidless octagonal tin containing a few novelty chessmen made of plastic, crudely imitating Chinese ivory pieces: the knight is a kind of Dragon, the king a seated Buddha.

Ernest Hemingway is said to have written a six-word short story — 「For sale. Baby shoes. Never worn.」 — that provides the inspiration for this exercise. Here is the exercise: Locate some suitable publication that carries classified advertisements, and write for that publication a list offering items for sale. Take the classic stand.

EXERCISE 16: Résumé

A résumé is a list presenting a person. Its writer can take the classic stand. Often, résumés are completely unclassic, signaling — through their formatting and phrasing — anxiety and desire. Résumés often appear simultaneously pushy and defensive, with ungenerous margins, scarce white space, compressed fonts, hyperbolic and aggressive vocabulary (「High-powered self-starter seeks management position with superpotential for advancement」), and the listing of every conceivable fact that might sway a reader (「Second-place, all-class essay competition, 7th grade, East Nowhere Middle School」). Academic résumés often expose self-inflicted wounds under「Publications」(「Genetics of the ALDH2 locus. Science, submitted」). Anyone established in the academy knows that anybody can submit anything anywhere; a submission is not a publication. A classic résumé, by contrast, is one whose writer, stylistically, is self-possessed, unconcerned, merely presenting. Stylistically, the writer has no anxiety. The writer does not want anything from the reader. The motive is truth — not desire for a job — and there is symmetry between writer and reader. A classic résumé typically has pleasing margins, ample white space, and a classic font. Its phrasing is calm. It is often distinctive for the range of lower-level detritus it leaves out. The style is not affected at all by insecurity, fear of unemployment, or sense of urgency, regardless of what is in the writer's mental network.

Here is the exercise: Write a résumé strongly influenced by classic style for a historical person: Anne Boleyn before her marriage, Einstein when he worked in the Swiss patent office, Hannibal before he invaded Europe, Grace Kelly before she made her first movie, Vermeer applying to the painters' guild.

EXERCISE 17: Admissions Essay

The essay, or statement, that an applicant submits for admission to a program belongs to a real scene that, like the résumé and the job interview, is unclassic in cast and purpose. But the applicant can write the essay entirely in classic style and may by doing so distinguish the application from a mountain of predictable rival submissions. Here is the exercise: Imagine such a case and write an admissions essay in which you, someone you know, or a historical or fictional person is the candidate.

EXERCISE 18: Science

Classic style is often the ideal style for scientific writing. Here is the exercise: Write a scientific piece in classic style. Point out where your reader should look and present the recognition. Stylistically, your reader is with you in a scene of classic joint attention, and pleased to be there.

Accomplished scientists often eschew stridency of any sort, since after all it is presumably the science that is the subject rather than the scientist or the scientist's chapel. Treating scientific writing as adversarial argument disguises the fact that almost all of a mature scientific piece is presentational: it presents the relevant tradition of research, and it presents the facts, events, and evidence that the reader needs.

Your own writing for this exercise will not resemble Sir Isaac Newton's prose, because he wrote in the early eighteenth century, but it may come as a surprise to see how often Newton used a style close to classic. Here is a passage from the Opticks (1704):

In a very dark Chamber, at a round Hole, about one third Part of an Inch broad made in the Shut of a Window, I placed a Glass Prism, whereby the Beam of the Sun's Light, which came in at that Hole, might be refracted upwards toward the opposite Wall of the Chamber, and there form a colour'd Image of the Sun. The Axis of the Prism (that is the Line passing through the middle of the Prism from one end of it to the other end parallel to the edge of the Refracting Angle was in this and the following Experiments perpendicular to the incident Rys. About this Axis I turned the Prism slowly, and saw the refracted Light on the Wall, or coloured Image of the Sun, first to descend, and then to ascend. Between the Descent and Ascent, when the Image seemed Stationary, I stopp'd the Prism, and fix'd it in that Posture, that it should be moved no more. For in that posture the Refractions of the Light at the two Sides of the Refracting Angle, that is at the Entrance of the Rays into the Prism, and at their going out of it, were equal to one another.

EXERCISE 19: Obituaries

obituaries often follow a template closely and exclude classic presentation. Such obituaries are conventional descriptions of mainly surface information — date and place of birth, education, professional accomplishment, cause of death. In these routine performances, there is often no indication that the writer is responsible for selecting details or exercising independent judgment. There are, however, exceptions. Jeremy Pearce's obituary for John L. Bull, one of the authors of The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Birds, Eastern Region, from which we quote in the first entry of the Museum, appeared in The New York Times for 15 August 2006. He includes the obligatory descriptive information but takes the classic stance in presenting what he has judged to be worth presenting. Here is how he ends the obituary:

Mr. Bull was often accompanied by his wife, an educator at the [American Museum of Natural History], on birding journeys. In 1989, the couple collaborated on a book,「Birds of North America: Western Region: A Quick Identification Guide for All Bird-Watchers.」

Remarking on the mourning doves that he spotted in Central Park, Mr. Bull observed:「They are the most monogamous birds I've ever watched. They always travel in pairs.」

This is classic presentation; it follows no template. The writer, in offering an analogy between the travels of Mr. Bull and his wife, and the travels of the mourning doves that Mr. Bull observed, decides what is significant and appropriate. His perfect dismount is a classic achievement, one that belongs to a writer, not to a template. Now try writing a classic obituary of your own.

EXERCISE 20: Real Estate Pitch

Like obituaries, real estate prose of the sort one finds in multiple listings of properties for sale is typically entirely impersonal. It is marked by obligatory hyperbole and artificial effervescence. Here is the exercise: Study some real estate prose and then present a house as if it were for sale, offering in classic style what the reader would want to know if that reader were shopping for a house. You might want to present a property not actually for sale: the Ca' d'Oro in Venice, Jacques Cœur's hôtel particulier in Bourges, the Rockoxhuis in Antwerp, the Getty Villa in Malibu, the White House during the federal government's bankruptcy sale.

EXERCISE 21: Restaurant Review

In classic style, direct perceptions, inferences, and judgments can all be treated as recognitions and can all be presented to a companion who will share these recognitions once they are pointed out. Restaurant reviews are not merely replete with inferences and judgments; they are an outstanding example in contemporary writing of discussions of taste, subject to endless debate and qualification. In classic style, taste can be treated as if it were as perceptible as a table setting. A restaurant review in the hands of a classic stylist treats its standards of judgment as obviously appropriate and writes as if the reader would agree not merely with the evaluation of the flavors in the ris de veau en salade but with the standards that produce that evaluation. The style is indifferent to what those standards might be. They might devalue mere novelty or they might value novelty above all. A classic restaurant review could either criticize a formal restaurant for using exotic instead of common ingredients in a traditional dish or praise it for innovating the traditional dish by using exotic ingredients. The classic restaurant review consists, in large measure, of placing the reader in a position to perceive both the validity of the judgments and the appropriateness of the standards — as if such matters are impossible to miss once obstacles are cleared out of the way and the reader has an unobstructed view of things.

Consider:

On a November evening in Dijon, Jean-Pierre Billoux serves wild duck, in its own juice, roasted with apples. This is the refinement of a classic by a master cook. There is no stridency or forced originality. The eight-year-old Corton Grancey seems to have been made for this perfectly roasted duck. This dish is the culmination of a tradition that has its historical roots in Guilaume Tirel's「Chapitre de Fricassure」; it reflects the accumulated wisdom of a six-hundred-year-old craft that translates nature and seasons, and their immemorial recurrence, into textures, fragrances, and flavors that allow you to feel yourself a part of them. It is rooted in a place too; it is not a cuisine suitable for「international hotels.」The seasons, the fragrances, the flavors of Burgundy are not the seasons, the fragrances, the flavors of Kyoto, or London, or Las Vegas.

The superiority of a cuisine rooted in a place and in a season over a cuisine suitable for「international hotels」is not asserted but treated as if it were as obvious as the duck and its apples.

Here is the exercise: Write a classic review of a restaurant and post it to one of the many online sites carrying restaurant reviews. Focus especially on including judgments in passing, almost incidentally, as if they are not personal judgments at all but rather elements of the restaurant that any competent diner could recognize, once pointed in the right direction.

EXERCISE 22: Travel Writing

Travel pieces — like cookbooks, restaurant reviews, and real estate descriptions — can be utilitarian. The reader is going somewhere and looks for facts and information in order to organize a trip. But in all of these genres, the practical purpose can be subordinated or even ignored. Travel writing can be completely presentational, and when it is, it can incorporate indefinite ranges of history, judgments, and cultural commentary, treated as if they can be seen.

The Michelin Green Guides are the gold standard of commercial travel writing. Here is a passage from the entry on the Abbey of Fontenay from the Michelin Green Guide to Burgundy:

Cistercian architecture first appeared in Burgundy in the first half of the 12C (Cistercium was the Latin name for the town of Cîteaux). It is characterized by a spirit of simplicity in keeping with the teaching of St Bernard. He objected bitterly to the luxury displayed in some monastery churches, opposing the theories of some of the great builders of the 11C and 12C with extraordinary passion. His argument against the belief of abbots such as St Hugh, Peter the Venerable, and Suger, who believed that nothing could be too rich for the glory of God was expressed for example in the letter he wrote to William, Abbot of St-Thierry, in which he asks,「Why this excessive height in the churches, this enormous length, this unnecessary width, these sumptuous ornaments and curious paintings that draw the eyes and distract attention and meditation? . . . We the monks, who have forsaken ordinary life and renounce worldly wealth and ostentation for the love of Christ, . . . in whom do we hope to awaken devotion with these ornaments?」

Fontenay, which is now a historic site and has not been a functioning church since the French Revolution of 1789, is one of the finest surviving examples of the austere beauty characteristic of Cistercian architecture, but no current visitor to Fontenay encounters Saint Bernard, his mentality, the opposition between styles of spirituality, or the architectural expression of that opposition in the uncluttered severity of Fontenay contrasted to the rich iconography of its Burgundian rival to the south, Cluny.

On reflection, it is not a surprise that the recognitions presented by the classic travel writer might lie beyond perception. As Mark Twain, launched on his career by his travel writing, observed,「[L]ife does not consist mainly — or even largely — of facts and happenings. It consists mainly of the storm of thoughts that is forever blowing through one's head.」Classic style domesticates these vast conceptual networks by blending them with the classic scene. Travel writing is an exemplary genre for such capacious classic presentation.

Here is the exercise: Write a classic travel piece, a presentation of a place or places, ranging wherever thought takes you, and without foregrounding any practical purpose.

EXERCISE 23: Prejudices: What about Peanut Butter?

A prejudice is something that has been accepted without the benefit of considered judgment: a preference for Swiss chocolate or Chinese tea, let us say, when they have not actually been compared to any alternative: Belgian chocolate or Indian tea. Everyone has such prejudices, but they are rarely presented as such. If you loathe baroque architecture and find art nouveau architecture pleasing because you have paid close attention to the style you like and haven't paid any attention to any other style, your taste has been affected by prejudice, but that is not necessarily a bad thing — especially in classic style, because the style has a fundamental prejudice of its own for human scale, and life is too short to give an impartial and considered judgment to every variety of chocolate or every style of architecture.

Someone with a narrow taste guided by prejudice can in fact offer a thoroughly excellent presentation of what falls within this restricted taste. Someone whose taste for art nouveau architecture has become a prejudice might be just the person whose essay on Victor Horta you will find most informative and even well-judged. Paul Erdös, the subject of a biography called The Man Who Loved Only Numbers, referred to anyone who had stopped doing mathematics as「dead.」For him, nonmathematicians were not alive. This legendary and, for Erdös, personally debilitating prejudice against anything but numbers did not mean that he was not worth listening to when he was talking about mathematics.

A presentation that covers many alternatives is not necessarily as good as a presentation — even if driven by prejudice — that focuses on just one. Here is the exercise: Present something you know and love without being defensive about it at all, without worrying about being fair or balanced. Belgian beer, baroque music, surfing in Southern california. Ignore that voice that says,「What about German beer? Gregorian chant? Alaia surfing in Australia? What about peanut butter?」

EXERCISE 24: Tethered Excursions

For this advanced exercise, select and present in classic style a subject as far away from the blackbird in the tree as possible, something that requires thought branching over almost every kind of conceptual geography. Our example — just one — is the concept of privacy. Privacy is something that cannot be directly perceived at all. It is a concept that stretches over all of human history, with remarkable differences across cultures in the placement of the dividing line between the private and the public. It is a highly nuanced concept that has never settled down. On the contrary, every aspect of it, from legal to moral to psychological, seems to be contested in our own time and place. It involves indefinitely many people, including unknown people. Presenting the concept of privacy is maximally uncongenial to the scene of classic joint attention. If you can blend the conceptual network for thinking and talking about privacy with the classic scene, we think you can blend anything with the classic scene, and you can consider yourself a competent classic stylist.

Conclusion

Every great artist was once an apprentice who learned fundamentals from someone much less talented. Velásquez was a much greater painter than his teacher. Newton was a much greater mathematician than his teacher. Neither could have progressed without a formation in fundamentals. Now that you have obtained a formation in fundamentals and experimented with a few advanced exercises, you have completed the apprenticeship offered in this Studio. But artists never really leave their studios. They continue to refine their grasp of fundamentals and extend their reach. There is no end to this refinement or extension. If there were a final exercise in the Studio, it would be to keep your eyes open for new opportunities to advance your command of style while keeping your presentations clear and simple as the truth.

0901 写作进阶练习

每位古典风格作者都会遇到新的情境。我们在原理篇解释了有些场合何种情况需要用到一组风格，或者混合风格，或者一种由一般风格发展而来的特殊风格。毕竟，风格的确立取决于对风格元素采取的一种连贯一致的立场，这种立场通过一系列问题表现出来，即真相、呈现、作者、读者、思想、语言，以及它们两两之间的关系。这些问题是我们开始写作之前，必须刻意回答或默认回答的基础问题。决定风格的是思想，遇到任一情境都要充分思考这些问题。学完工作室全部课程的人，即使后续没有进一步的指导，也可以通过思考这些风格元素并运用工作室学到的技巧，识别和处理新的主题类型。下面我们列举一些可能会遇到的新情境。

练习 13：速写

美国大部分写作教学强调文章的修改。这种方法对想要学习古典风格的学生来说是致命的。古典风格作家的基本能力，是让自己沉浸到这种风格中，在这种风格中写作。拖着一篇一开始就不是古典风格的文章穿越乱石丛林，妄想通过某种方式把它改成古典风格，几乎总是面临失败。沉浸到古典风格中，就是想象着把古典场景和支持表达的思想网络融合在一起。这种融合可以锚定思想网络，提供古典风格的结构。这也是古典风格作者从始至终的工作平台。古典风格作者学习直接以融合场景中的视角说话，即使一开始的表现一般。一篇在古典风格框架内构思和创作的文章有修改的余地，但没有确立特定风格的草稿不可能改成古典风格。传统建议都是把「风格」看作最后的润色，这种见解简直是灾难，因为风格不是改改就能加上去的表层修饰。风格必须从一开始就考虑。别再以为「开始写作」是在你写下什么之后才开始的。来艺术工作室经常要求学生带着速写本去野外速写。他们看到一些东西，迅速画出来，从不擦改，而是很快翻到下一张空白页继续画其他东西。之后，他们会回看自己的速写，但他们不会修改。本工作室的速写练习要求你像艺术生速写一样写作。

练习题：观察野外的场景；进入古典风格；呈现你的观察。不要修改。坚持做完十篇文章速写。当你开始做速写进阶练习时，你可能要增加难度，像你做通用练习一样，去挑战那些没那么容易直接观察到的事物，在风格上要始终将它们融入可直接观察的事物中。完成十个古典风格速写练习后，把这阶段的练习放到一边。过段时间再回看，但不要修改它们。明天，再做一遍速写练习。每天做一点速写练习并连续坚持几周，看起来能快速提升学生的风格水平。一开始，他们觉得很难，进步也不明显，但几天后，就开始自然而然地写出古典风格了。通过几周的速写练习改掉坏习惯后，一些学生很快克服了前期的适应阶段。

练习 14：风格融合

一个主张古典风格的工作室，提倡学习不完全是古典风格的风格，看起来自相矛盾。但只要有少部分古典风格成分，也能体现古典风格的特点，而且应用这种混合风格的机会很多。指导手册的动机是实用。但也没必要表现得很冷淡：角色之间可以多些互动；思想和语言可以更鲜明。它的口吻不一定是用一项工作描述回应另一项工作描述。我们可以换一种方式，把实用动机与古典呈现结合起来，创造一种混合风格，也许可以称为古典实用风格，这种混合风格的魅力和力量并不局限于实现一个实际的目标。想象你在读一本烹饪菜谱，尽管你没有烹饪的意愿。古典实用风格的烹饪菜谱，可能仅仅因为古典呈现的特点很吸引人。许多风格都可以融入古典风格的成分，创造出一种毫不违和的古典风味。

练习题：挑一个你理解得比较透彻的主题，写一篇「如何做」的教程，主题不限。如何通过树叶认出一棵树，如何避免遗嘱认证，如何举办一场晚会。当然了，文章的目的是实用，但尝试把古典风格的成分融入其中。这些古典风格的成分可能包含古典风格的口吻、相互配合的角色、充分表达的语言、利落的开头和收尾、作为互补动机的真相、作为互补目的的呈现。

练习 15：清单

清单可以用古典风格写吗？当然！写作素材并不决定风格类型。写清单的人完全可以按照模板要求写，像公证人出具物品清单一样。但作者还可以采取古典风格的立场一某人发现值得向他人呈现的东西。作者会为他的选择承担所有责任。

一份菜单就是一份清单，但如果用古典风格来写，也能呈现一家餐馆的特色和传统，以及某种菜系的性质。呈现的背后有餐馆老板、厨师和餐厅经理。古典风格中，一份菜单或酒单，绝不是毫无章法地列出刚好能供应的食物和酒水清单。一份酒单可以透露待酒师的知识、文化和品位。在上一个练习中，你练习了如何把具有其他实用目的事物写成古典风格。同样，菜单和酒单也能用古典风格写出来，尽管它们的实用目的很明显。对食物和酒感兴趣的人，阅读一份古典风格的菜单或酒单，也能读得津津有味，哪怕这家餐馆远在大陆的另一边，或者关门好多年了。

菜单和酒单，作为清单的其中一种形式，可以用古典立场呈现，自然也能阅读和欣赏，无论它的实用目的是什么。乔治·佩雷克（Georges Perec）在《人生拼图版》（La vie mode d'emploi）这本书中想象出一座公寓大楼，呈现了其地下室储物柜的物品清单。每一份清单都是一份精彩绝伦的呈现，用个体口吻讲述的不只是物品本身，还有屋主的习惯、历史和性格以及不同屋主的文化共鸣。试举其中两例。

巴特尔布思的地窖：

巴特尔布思的地下室里放着用剩的煤，煤上还放了一只装着木柄铁丝把手的黑色搪瓷桶，一辆自行车挂在肉钩上，放瓶子的空柳条篮和四只大旅行箱鼓鼓的，油布面，木条腰带，四角包铜饰，箱内全部用薄锌片衬里，因此箱子严密不渗水。1

罗尔沙斯的酒窖：

栅栏门左侧放着一个搁瓶子的包塑铁丝笼，下层放着五瓶果酒：樱桃酒、黄香李酒、紫罗兰李酒、李子酒、覆盆子酒。中间条板上放着里姆斯基科萨柯夫根据普希金作品改编的《金公鸡》—— 俄语写的 —— 和一本通俗小说《鲁汶铁匠的讼费或复仇》，封面印着一位年轻姑娘把一袋金子送给一位法官。上面条板上放着一个没有盖的八边形盒子，里面放着几个模仿中国牙雕的塑料棋子：马是一种龙，国王是一个坐着的菩萨。① 2

①《人生拼图版》两个选段的汉译文均出自丁雪英和连燕堂的合译版本。—— 译者注

据说欧内斯特·海明威写过一篇只有六个词的短篇小说 ——「出售。婴鞋。未穿。」（For sale..Baby shoes..Never worn。）—— 这给了本练习灵感。

练习题：找一份合适的出版物，刊登分类广告的那种，并为该出版物编写一份待售物品清单。用上古典立场。

练习 16：简历

简历是一种呈现个人的清单。写简历的人也可以采取古典立场。一般，简历完全不属于古典风格，它的格式和措辞处处透露着焦虑和渴望。简历看起来既咄咄逼人又急于自我辩护，页边距很窄，没有多少空白，字密密麻麻，措辞夸张且一副志在必得的口气（自我驱动力强，寻求潜在晋升空间大的管理岗），为了说服读者，逐一列出所有能想到的全部事实（东方止境中学七年级全班作文比赛第二名）。学术型简历通常在「发表作品」栏下自揭伤疤（《科学》「ALDH2 中心的基因」，已提交）。在学术界立足的人都知道任何人可以在任何地方提交作品；但提交不代表发表。相比而言，用古典风格写简历的人，在风格上笃定从容，只是呈现。从风格上看，作者没有一丝焦虑。作者对读者别无所求。动机就是真相一而不是想要一份工作一作者与读者之间是对等关系。一份古典风格作品，常常选用古典字体，并留出合适的页边距和充分的空白。它的措辞沉着冷静。因为没有低级的废话，格外与众不同。古典风格不会因为缺乏安全、恐惧失业或感到紧迫受任何影响，不管作者的思想网络发生了什么。

练习题：为一位历史人物写份古典风格的简历：结婚前的安妮·博林（Anne Boleyn），曾在瑞士专利注册局工作的爱因斯坦（Einstein），

入侵欧洲之前的汉尼拔（Hannibal），拍出电影处女作前的格蕾丝·凯利（Grace Kelly），申请加入画家协会的维米尔（Vermeer）。

练习 17：申请书

申请加入某个项目时呈递的论文或陈述，是一种现实场景，与简历和面试一样，角色和目的都不是古典风格。但申请人完全可以采用古典风格撰写论文，还有可能借此从众多墨守成规的申请书中脱颖而出。

练习题：想象这样一种场合，为候选人写一封申请书，候选人可以是你自己、你知道的人，也可以是一位历史人物或一位小说角色。

练习 18：科学写作

古典风格常常是科学写作的理想风格。

练习题：用古典风格写一篇科学论文。向读者指出应该关注的地方，并呈现你的观察结果。在风格上，你的读者与你处在同一个古典联合注意场景中，也很乐意待在那种场景中。

优秀的科学家通常避免任何形式的咄咄逼人，毕竟文章主题大部分时候应是科学本身，而不是科学家或科学教条。把科学写作当作针锋相对的辩驳忽视了一个事实：一篇成熟的科学论文处处都在呈现相关的研究传统，呈现读者想了解的事实、事件和证据。

你本次练习的文章不会像艾萨克·牛顿爵士的文章一样，因为他写于十八世纪早期，但是你也许会惊讶地发现，牛顿经常使用的写作风格，跟古典风格非常接近。下面一段话摘自牛顿的著作《光学》（Opticks）（1704）。

在一间非常黑暗的房间里，护窗板上开了一个三分之一英寸的圆孔，我在圆孔处放了一块玻璃棱镜，太阳光束透过这个圆孔，可能会向上折射到室内对面墙壁上，并在那里形成太阳的彩色图像。本实验以及接下来的实验中，棱镜的轴（通过棱镜中心从一端到另一端且与折射角的边平行的直线）与入射光线垂直。我围绕此轴慢慢转动棱镜，看到墙上的折射光，即太阳的彩色图像，先下降，然后上升。在下降和上升之间，当图像看起来不动时，我停止转动棱镜，并将它固定在这一姿势中，以使它不再转动。因为在这种姿势时，光的折射在折射角两侧，即在光射入和射出棱镜处，彼此相等。① 3

① 汉译文出自周岳明、舒幼生、邢峰和熊汉富合译版本。—— 译者注

练习 19：讣告

讣告通常严格按照模板来写，不会用古典风格呈现。这些讣告主要是对表面信息的常规描述 —— 出生的地方和日期、教育程度、职业成就、死亡原因。一般看不出来这些常规描述是作者个人的选择或独立判断。但是，也有例外。我们在博览篇第一条引用过一本书《奥杜邦协会北美鸟类野外观鸟指南·美国东部地区》，其中一位作者是约翰·布尔，他逝世后，杰拉米·佩尔斯为他写了一则讣告，刊载于 2006 年 8 月 15 日出版的《纽约时报》上。这篇讣告除了给出必要信息，还以古典立场呈现了作者认为值得呈现的内容，讣告结尾如下。

布尔先生的妻子，一位美国自然历史博物馆的教育工作者，经常陪同布尔观鸟。1989 年，这对夫妇合著了一本书《观鸟速查手册：北美西部地区鸟类图鉴》（Birds of North America: Western Region: A Quick Identification Guide for All Bird-Watchers）。

布尔先生在中央公园看到一对哀鸣的鸽子，评论道：「我见过的鸟当中，它们最遵守一夫一妻原则。它们总是成双成对地飞行。」

这就是古典呈现，不用任何模板。作者把布尔先生与他妻子的旅行，类比为布尔先生看到的一对哀鸣的鸽子的飞行时，决定了什么信息是重要的、合适的。他用古典风格写出了完美的结尾，这是一位作者的结尾，而不是一份模板的结尾。现在试着为自己写一则古典风格的讣告。

练习 20：房产广告

同讣告一样，人们在很多房屋出售资讯中看到的那种房地产介绍通常枯燥乏味。用词夸张和佯装热情是一贯的做派。

练习题：先研读一些真实的房地产介绍信息，然后写一则房产介绍，就好像要放到市场上出售一样，用古典风格写，给真正有买房意愿的读者提供他想要的信息。或许你也可以给不供出售的房产写广告：威尼斯的黄金宫（Ca'd'oro），法国布尔日雅克·科尔酒店（Jacques Ceur's Hotel particuier）、比利时安特卫普洛克斯庭院（the Rockoxhuis）、加州马里布的盖蒂别墅（the Getty Villa）、联邦政府破产期间出售的美国白宫。

练习 21：餐厅评论

在古典风格中，直接观察、推测和判断都可以看作可识别的事物并呈现给身边的人，一旦指出来，他们会像你一样看到这些事物。餐厅评论不完全是推测与判断；它们是典型的现代食评文章，容易引发没完没了的争议和解释。在古典风格中，食物味道可以跟桌上的餐具一样具体可见。古典风格作者写餐厅评论就好像他的评判标准自然公正，读者不仅会认可作者对沙拉酱甜面包口味的评判，还会认可他的评判标准。古典风格并不看重这些评判标准可能是什么。这些标准可以把创新看得一文不值，也可以认为创新高于一切。一篇古典风格的餐厅评论，既可以批判一家正统餐厅使用新奇原料而非常规原料做一道传统菜肴，也可以赞赏它使用新奇原料创新传统菜肴。古典风格的餐厅评论很大程度上将读者置于一种位置，让他既能看出评判是否合理也能看出评判标准是否恰当 —— 好像一旦清除障碍，读者的视线畅通，就不可能漏掉这些问题。我们来看下面这一段文字。

在法国第戎十一月的某个晚上，让-皮埃尔·比尤（Jean-Pierre Billoux）烹饪了一道烤野鸭子，就着鸭子自带的酱汁，跟苹果一起烤。这是一位烹饪大师对一道经典莱式所做的改良。没有强硬的态度，也不是非创新不可。八年的戈东格朗赛葡萄酒，似乎专为这道完美的烤鸭酿造。这道菜标志着传统莱系的巅峰，可以回溯到中世纪法国宫廷御厨绩尧姆·蒂雷尔（Guilaume Tirel）的「炖肉主题」（Chapitre de Fricassure）；这反映了六百年工艺传承下来的智慧，将自然与季节以及它们古老的周而复始化成肌理、芬芳和口味，让你觉得自己是它们的一部分。它也有自已的专属领地：它不会出现在「国际酒店」里。勃艮第的季节、芬芳和风味，不是京都、伦敦或拉斯维加斯的季节、芬芳和风味。

一道独属某个地方某个季节的菜肴，远胜「国际酒店」专供的菜肴，这种优势没有被反复强调，而是被看作和鸭子以及它搭配的苹果一样显然。

练习题：写一篇古典风格的餐厅评论，并发布到任何一个可以线上点评餐厅的网站上。重点在于你的评价不要太刻意，几乎是顺口一提，好像它们根本不是个人的评论，而是餐厅本身的元素一任何一位有能力的食客都能看到，只要指出正确的方向。

练习 22：旅游纪行

跟食谱、餐厅评论和房地产资讯一样，旅游纪行可以很实用。读者计划去某个地方，为组织旅行寻找事实和信息。但是所有这些题材的实用目的可以是顺带的，或者甚至可以忽略。旅游纪行完全可以写成呈现，一旦用这种方式，它可以将各种历史、判断和文化评论都包含进去，把它们都当作直接可见的事物。

《米其林绿色指南》（The Michelin Green Guides）是商业旅行指南的黄金标准。下面这段文字是《米其林绿色指南·勃艮第版》对枫特奈修道院（Abbey of Fontenay）的介绍。

十二世纪上半叶勃艮第首次出现熙笃会「Cistercium 是 Citeaux（熙笃）的拉丁文」。它以简洁的风格著称，遵从圣·伯纳尔德（St. Bernard）的教律。他极力反对一些修道院教堂的奢华装饰，不认同十一、十二世纪那些热情洋溢的伟大建筑师的理论。圣·休（St. Hugh）、（Peter the Venerable）以（Suger）等修道院院长认为，为了上帝的荣誉再怎么富丽堂皇都不为过，圣·伯纳尔德对此有截然相反的意见，他在写给圣·蒂埃里（St. Thierry）修道院院长威廉的信中问道：「为什么教堂要建得这么高、这么长、这么宽，远远超过正常的需要？为什么用这些奢华的装饰物和激发好奇心的画作吸人眼球、分散注意力和扰乱清修？… 我们这些僧侣，因为热爱耶稣基督，放弃了凡俗的生活，放弃了世俗的财富和荣誉，…...我们希望用这些装饰唤起谁的热忱呢？」4

枫特奈修道院，自 1789 年法国大革命结束后不再发挥教堂的功能，现在作为一道历史遗迹，完好保存着熙笃会建筑典型的简洁朴素特征。只是，如今参观枫特奈的游客再也不会遇到圣·伯纳尔德，再也无法体会他的心态，再也不会看到两种相互对立的精神风格和这种对立表达在建筑上的特点 —— 枫特奈修道院简洁朴素，而另一座同在勃艮第靠南边的克卢尼修道院（Cuny）装饰繁华。

仔细想想，古典纪行作家呈现的见闻不一定是直接观察到的事物，也没什么奇怪的。以纪行开启作家生涯的马克·吐温说：「生活的主要构成部分 —— 或者说大部分构成部分 —— 不是事实或事件，而是人们头脑中时刻发生的思想风暴。」5 古典风格将这巨大的思想网络与古典场景融合在一起。纪行是练习这种大容量古典呈现的最佳题材。

练习题：用古典风格写一篇纪行，介绍一个或多个地方，跟着你的思路走，不用特别强调任何实用目的。

练习 23：偏见：花生酱是不是更好？

偏见是未经过深思熟虑就确认的观点。举个例子，当一个人只品尝过瑞士巧克力或中国茶，不知道实际上还有别的同类产品（比如此利时巧克力或者印度茶）可以比较时，他就会偏好瑞士巧克力或中国茶。每个人都有这类偏见，但很少以这种方式表现出来。如果你喜欢新艺术运动风格的建筑却不喜欢巴洛克风格的建筑，只是因为你关注你喜欢的风格没关注任何别的风格，那么你的品位就带着偏见，但这不一定是件坏事 —— 尤其在古典风格中，古典风格因人类的局限性有它自身的基本偏见，而人生苦短，不可能客观、全面地考虑到巧克力的每个品种或建筑的每种风格。

一个带着偏见、品位狭隘的人，实际上可以把原本局限的品位呈现得十分精彩。你可能会发现，一个对艺术运动风格有自己偏见的人，对维克多·霍塔（Victor Horta）① 的介绍可能恰恰最实用甚至最中肯。人物传记《数字情种》（The Man Who Loved Only Numbers）中的主角保罗·埃尔德什 ②（Paul Erdes），认为一旦停止数学活动，人就「死了」。对他而言，不从事数学的人没有活着的。埃尔德什贬低数字之外的一切事物，这种人所共知的偏见，并不意味着当埃尔德什谈论数学时，他的观点就不值得听。

① 维克多·霍塔（Victor Horta），1861-1947，比利时人，世界著名建筑设计大师，新艺术运动的杰出代表人物之一。—— 译者注

② 保罗·埃尔德什（Paul Erde6s），匈牙利籍犹太人，数学家，论文数量居史上数学家之最。—— 译者注

追求面面俱到的呈现，不一定胜过专注某一个方面的呈现，即使是出于偏见。

练习题：介绍一种你熟悉并且钟情的事物，不用为它辩护，也不用担心你的介绍是否有失公允或有所偏颇。比如比利时啤酒、巴洛克音乐、南加州冲浪。忽略这些声音：「德国啤酒怎么样？格里高利圣咏呢？澳大利亚阿拉亚冲浪呢？花生酱怎么样？」

练习 24：镣铐之游：谈隐私

为这次进阶练习选一个与「树上的乌鸦」截然不同的主题，用古典风格呈现时需要考虑到几乎每一种概念地理环境（Conceptual geography）。我们仅举隐私概念这一个例子。隐私是一种无法直接观察到的东西。它是一个延及整个人类历史的概念，不同文化对隐私与公开之间的界限有截然不同的区分。它是一种相当微妙的概念，从未有确定的定义。相反，从法理到道德再到心理学，它的每一个方面似乎都受到我们自己时代和社会的质疑。它涉及很多人，这当中的人数无法确定，还包括未知的人。呈现隐私概念，与古典联合注意的场景格格不入。如果你能将思考隐私和谈论隐私的概念网络与古典场景结合起来，我们认为你有能力将任何东西与古典场景结合起来，你也就可以把自己看作一位合格的古典风格作者了。
