第一部分 古典风格的原理

1.0 导语

讲古典风格之前，我们要先了解什么是风格，以及一些常见风格与古典风格的区别。如果只能感觉一篇文章有风格，却不知道什么决定了风格，或者误以为调整字词就能形成风格，那么写好文章恐怕只是凭运气罢了。本书第一部分将带领大家认识不同风格，培养写作中的风格意识，选用一种比你的默认风格更实用、更自然的风格来进人写作的秘境。

结语：风格不是写作规范

本书希望成为一本古典风格学习指南，可以说对它的主题做了全面的分析。虽然本书默认读者的书写语言是英文，但这种风格不局限于某一门具体的语言。它是修昔底德等古希腊作家使用的风格，是十七世纪法国一批杰出作家使用的风格，尽管他们大多数人不会古希腊语；它是十八世纪法国化学家安托万·拉瓦锡使用的风格，是二十世纪美国的记者兼新闻评论员李伯龄使用的风格。本书讨论的原则是一种关于风格元素的立场，而不是一种或多种英语变体用法手册的依据。任何具备语言能力的人都能学古典风格，因为古典风格的原则像适用于英语一样，同样适用于日语或孟加拉语。

写作的概念比风格要广泛得多，我们已经尽力区分两者，但美国人常常混淆它们：写作的风格和英语的写作。大多数美国人在英语课上学写作，不少调查表明大多数美国人理解的英语无外乎拼写和用法（选择表达「可能」的情态动词用 can 还是 may，affect 与 effect 都能指「影响」，但前一个是动词后一个是名词，imply 和 infer 都能表达「暗示」但场景不同，等等，类似的例子不胜枚举）。

除了一些谈基本写作问题的书以外，还有大量且越来越多的相当于规范手册的书讨论惯用法和其他表面特征，这些都源于一种默认的假设：一个人只要掌握所有这些规范要点，就能写「英语」。形成这种假设的依据是了解事物就是了解它的表面细节。

有些人就常基于这种假设奚落别人，听起来无人可反驳。「X 怎么可能知道认识论（epistemology）？他连这个词都拼不出来！」口头语言也会有同样的轻视：「Y 怎么可能知道德加（Degas）？她连他的名字都念不出来！」这些话说出来几乎总是言之凿凿，虽然没一句有道理。任何一个人想说什么事物时，即使不会拼或不会念，完全有可能了解很多，这很普遍。

精通一本规范手册，掌握现在惯用的拼写规则，明确区分「allusion」（暗指）与「illusion」（幻想）和所有其他常用混淆词，不能说一定学不会标准英语。但这是最不可能学会的方式，就像马尔科姆·X（Malcolm X）想通过背诵字典来获得读写能力一样。问题是任何人想通过规范手册学会写作（字典也是语言规范手册的一种，就永远只是被动地接受建议；它们没有提供一组原则，让一个人理解这些原则后就可以不看手册。比如，一个会讲英语的人从不会写错句子顺序：他不太可能不确定是说「递给我糖浆」（Pass me the molasses）还是「我糖浆递给」（Me molasses pass the），还是这个人，但他可能会不确定「糖浆」（molasses）的正确拼写，即使他成为一家报纸的总编辑或一名英语教授。

作者要掌握一种风格，光做到准确还不够；即使一篇文章、一封书信、一则报道或是一本书完全「准确」，还是有可能表达不清；可能压根没有写出作者原本要表达的东西。这种表达，如果只是准确无误，哪怕有用，也只是一时的用处，时间久了就很难理解。夏尔·戴高乐（Charles de Gaulle）有一次去莫斯科进行国事访问时，用准确易懂的俄语发表演讲，让莫斯科人很吃惊。在那之前，没人知道他会讲俄语。这令一些国家的情报部门很难堪，以为是情报工作出了明显的纰漏，竟然不知道戴高乐会说什么语言，后来他们才发现没有弄错。戴高乐的确不会说俄语，他只是接受了训练，通过背诵录音正确读出俄语单词，并用一种显然是周密思考过的方式把它们组合一起，再用同样的方式抑扬顿挫地讲出来。这是一个演员娴熟运用技巧的表现。戴高乐的表现是轰动的，但这并没让他学会说俄语，他仍然对俄语一窍不通。

这本小书不是某种捷径，无法帮助你实现学写英语或任何其他语言这类不现实的目标。本书的目标不是教你怎么提升技巧怎么写英语这样模糊又泛泛无边的问题。本书有一个切实可行的目标，如何充分理解一个更具体的领域：古典风格，包括它在英语上的具体应用。第一个目标，「写英语」，和绝不会拼错单词一样不现实；第二个目标，写古典文章，就像写对语序一样能学会。如果你记不住「effect」和「affect」之间的差别，本书也帮不了你，笔者也不会赢得拼写比赛的冠军；如果我们以为学会写作就是学一种语言表面的偶然因素，没人能成为一个好作者。世上有哪个英语行家可以把《牛津英语词典》或《韦氏词典》中每一个单词都读出来、拼出来并用对呢？这能说明没有真正会说英语的人吗？一位有能力的作者完全可以掌握一种风格的原则，任何风格都不会是一组死板的规则。一旦理解这些原则并娴熟地运用起来，作者就能主动使用这种风格，这种风格会成为作者灵活运用的能力之一，就像轻松写对句子顺序一样。即使这种风格有它的限制，但创造和发现的空间是无限的；就像英语语序有它的限制，但形成意义和表达的空间是无限的；因为掌握一种写作风格就像掌握基本的语言能力一样，是一种需灵活运用的活动，不是某种死记硬背的表演。

### 1.1 The Concept of Style

「Style」is a word everybody uses, but almost no one can explain what it means. It is often understood as the inessential or even disreputable member of a two-term set: style and substance. This set of terms is elastic but in all its many applications, style is the subordinate term and, in the traditional American idiom, there is a persistent suggestion that we would be better off without it. Style is, at best, a harmless if unnecessary bit of window dressing. At worst, it is a polite name for fraud. There used to be a cigar company whose motto was「All Quality. No Style.」

When style is considered the opposite of substance, it seems optional and incidental, even when it is admired. In this way of framing things, substantive thought and meaning can be prior to style and completely separable from it. The identical thought or the identical meaning, it is suggested, can be expressed in many styles — or even in none at all, as when just plain integrity or the unvarnished truth is offered as an alternative to the adornments of style. Style, conceived this way, is something fancy that distracts us from what is essential; it is the varnish that makes the truth at least a little harder to see.

The notion that style is something completely separate from substance, so that substance can be offered「straight,」lies behind both the motto of the cigar company and William Butler Yeats's description of Bernard Shaw's writing, but in the second case the poet puts a high value on style and views writing in no style, while possible, to be something monstrously mechanical. Yeats apparently thought of his own characteristic poetic voice as「style.」It was a voice so compelling that attempts to imitate it have ruined quite a number of aspiring poets. Shaw's voice was not poetic in Yeats's sense, so Yeats considered Shaw to be a writer「without style.」Because he held the view that style is optional, Yeats could simultaneously view Shaw as「the most formidable man in modern letters,」able to write「with great effect,」and yet view Shaw's writing as「without music, without style, either good or bad.」He described Shaw as a nightmare sewing machine that clicked, shone, and smiled,「smiled perpetually.」

Whether style is viewed as spiritual, fraudulent, or something in between, any concept of style that treats it as optional is inadequate not only to writing but to any human action. Nothing we do can be done「simply」and in no style, because style is something inherent in action, not something added to it. In this respect, style is like the typeface in which a text is printed. We may overlook it, and frequently do, but it is always there. The styles we acquire unconsciously remain invisible to us as a rule, and routine actions can seem to be done in no style at all, even though their styles are obvious to experienced observers. A printer, a proofreader, or a type designer cannot fail to notice the type in which a text is printed, but for most of us, that typeface will have to be laid down beside a contrasting face before we even notice it exists. We thought we were looking at words pure and simple and did not notice that they are printed in a specific typeface.

When we do something in a default style acquired unconsciously, we do not notice the style of our activity. In such cases, we have an abstract concept of action that leaves style out of account. We can have a concept of lying without being aware — as a good investigative reporter is — that, in practice, we must have a style of lying. We can have a concept of quarreling without being aware — as a good marriage counselor is — that, in practice, we must have a style of quarreling.

Despite a lifetime of speaking, we can remain unaware of having a style of speaking. Yankees in Maine or Good ol' Boys in Louisiana think that people from Brooklyn talk funny. WASPS in the Chicago suburbs think that Poles or Lithuanians in Chicago speak English with an accent, as if the suburban WASPS, the Yankees, and the Good ol' Boys speak just plain American English with no accent. Coastal Californians think — just as the ancient Greeks did — that everybody else sounds barbarous. A moment's reflection will convince anyone that it is impossible to speak without an accent. But people who feel they set the local tone do not consider their own accents to be accents. It is hard to think of a child who is just learning to speak wanting to learn a style of speaking. The style is folded into the activity as it is learned: we think that we have learned to speak a language, not that we have learned a regional dialect. Children in Maine do not think they are learning to speak English with a Yankee accent; they think they are learning to speak English.

Although there are certainly a lot of English accents to be heard, even if we restrict the field to America, only a few people consciously choose theirs. Professional broadcasters, of course, do; sometimes people interested in acting careers do. Many politicians with degrees from prestigious universities have learned to speak with one accent in the capitals where they make laws and policy and quite a different one back home where they campaign for office. Senator Fulbright was a Rhodes scholar with an Oxford education. Before he went to the Senate, he had been the dean of a law school and the president of a university. His background was perfectly congruent with what he sounded like in action as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee conducting hearings on the Vietnam War, but when he campaigned in rural Arkansas, where he got his votes, there was no hint of Oxford, or even Fayetteville. On the stump, he sounded completely down home. After the election, that sound dissipated with every mile he got closer to Washington until he was sworn in for a new term and reassumed both the seat of power and the music of policy.

Senator Fulbright could maintain two dramatically distinct styles of speech in his personal repertory because he was aware of both as styles and consequently did not mistake either of them for just plain English. His awareness of his own styles allowed him to switch back and forth between them and fit them to circumstances. Everyone does this to some extent, but not everyone is aware of doing so. Speakers who are not consciously aware of their styles run into problems when none of their habitual styles fits a particular circumstance very well. We are trapped by our unconscious styles if we cannot recognize them as styles. When all of our styles are effectively default styles, we choose without knowing we are choosing and so cannot recognize the practical possibility of alternative styles.

People who unconsciously have acquired a full complement of routine conversational styles can deliberately and consciously add a new style of conversation to their collection, a style invented for new purposes and situations, once they have an operating concept of style. A novice receptionist at the headquarters of a large corporation consciously acquires the standard impersonal business style of conversation. The receptionist already possesses an underlying competence in conversation; he consciously acquires a new style meant for a special and unusually well-defined purpose.

Because writing is an activity, it too must be done in a style. But the domain of writing, like the domain of conversation, is enormous, not limited by just a handful of occasions or purposes. Consequently, there are many styles of writing. Common wisdom to the contrary, no one can master writing because writing is too large to be encompassed. It is not one skill; it is not even a small bundle of routine skills. A single style of writing invented for particular purposes, however, can be like a receptionist's conversation, something small enough to be walked around. It is possible to see where it begins and where it ends, what its purposes and occasions are, and how it selects its themes. These styles of writing can be acquired consciously as styles. Classic style is one of them.

Although nearly anybody who can read a newspaper can write, the styles we acquired unconsciously do not always serve our needs. Most of us have no unconscious writing style available to use when, after becoming engaged in a problem, we have thought it through, reached confident conclusions, and want to make our thought accessible to a permanent but unspecified audience. Even the best-educated members of our society commonly lack a routine style for presenting the result of their own engagement with a problem to people outside their own profession. Writers with a need to address such readers invented classic style. It is not a routine style in our culture, and unlike most of the writing styles we acquire, it is unlikely to be picked up without deliberate effort.

Classic style was not invented by one person or even by a small group working together. It was not invented just once, nor is it specific to one culture or one language. It was used with notable skill and effect by some of the outstanding French writers of the seventeenth century, and their achievements have left an echo in French culture that has no direct English or American equivalent. The seventeenth-century French masters of classic style, for one reason or another, conceived of themselves as addressing an intelligent but nonspecialist reader. They were all writers who had no doubt about the general importance of what they had to say. They shared the idea that truth about something is, in some sense, truth about everything, and they adopted the view that it is always possible to present a really significant conclusion to a general audience.

Classic style is focused and assured. Its virtues are clarity and simplicity; in a sense, so are its vices. It declines to acknowledge ambiguities, unessential qualifications, doubts, or other styles. It declines to acknowledge that it is a style. It makes its hard choices silently and out of the reader's sight. Once made, those hard choices are not acknowledged to be choices at all; they are presented as if they were inevitable because classic style is, above all, a style of presentation with claims to transparency.

To write without a chosen and consistent style is to write without a tacit concept of what writing can do, what its limits are, who its audience is, and what the writer's goals are. In the absence of settled decisions about these things, writing can be torture. While there is no single correct view of these matters, every well-defined style must take a stand on them. Classic style is neither shy nor ambiguous about fundamentals. The style rests on the assumptions that it is possible to think disinterestedly, to know the results of disinterested thought, and to present them without fundamental distortion. In this view, thought precedes writing. All of these assumptions may be wrong, but they help to define a style whose usefulness is manifest.

The attitudes that define classic style — the attitudes that define any style — are a set of enabling conventions. Some of the originators of classic style may have believed its enabling conventions — such as that truth can be known — but writing in this style requires no commitment to a set of beliefs, only a willingness to adopt a role for a limited time and a specific purpose.

The role is severely limited because classic prose is pure, fearless, cool, and relentless. It asks no quarter and gives no quarter to anyone, including the writer. While the role can be necessary, true, and useful, as well as wonderfully thrilling, it can hardly be permanent. For better or worse, human beings are not pure, fearless, cool, or relentless, even if we may find it convenient for certain purposes to pretend that we are. The human condition does not, in general, allow the degree of autonomy and certainty that the classic writer pretends to have. It does not sustain the classic writer's claim to disinterested expression of unconditional truth. It does not allow the writer indefinitely to maintain the posture required by classic style. But classic style simply does not acknowledge the human condition. The insouciance required to ignore what everyone knows and to carry the reader along in this style cannot be maintained very long, and the masters of the style always know its limits. The classic distance is a sprint.

0101 风格与古典风格

1.1 风格的概念

「风格」是每个人都会用的词，但几乎没人可以解释它的含义。「风格」与「内容」是一组词，但「风格」通常被认为不必要，甚至略带贬义。这组词使用灵活，但在多数用法中，风格是次要的一项，而且美国传统习语一直暗含这样的意思：没有风格我们会更好。往好说，风格可以装点门面，虽无必要但也无害；往坏说，这只是弄虚作假的委婉表达。过去有一家雪茄公司的标语就是「只要质量，无须风格」（AⅡ Quality, No Style.）。

即使人们欣赏风格，但风格被当作内容的对立面时，看起来只是一条可选的附加项。按照这种说法，内容上的思想和意义是先于风格产生的，且两者完全独立。也就是说，同样的思想或同样的意义可以用多种风格表达 —— 甚至什么风格都不用，我们可以选择某种风格来修饰，也可以直白坦率地、不加修饰地陈述。这样看，风格只是一种妨碍我们看到事物本来面目的装饰物；它好比给真相涂上一层清漆，至少看得不那么清晰了。

风格与内容完全独立，所以内容可以「直接」表达出来，这不是雪茄公司广告标语独有的理念，诗人威廉·巴特勒·叶芝在描述萧伯纳的作品时也持有同样的观点，不同的是，叶芝认为风格很重要，没有风格的作品即便存在，也是极其机械的东西。显然，叶芝把自己作品中独特的诗意音韵看作「风格」。它是一种迷人的音韵，吸引众多雄心勃勃的诗人竞相模仿，结果反倒毁了这些诗人的名声。在叶芝看来，萧伯纳的音韵毫无诗意可言，所以他认为萧伯纳是一位「没有风格」的作家。因为秉持风格可以选择这种观点，叶芝认为萧伯纳是「现代文学中最可怕的人」1，文章「影响深远」，但又觉得萧伯纳写的东西「没有音乐，没有风格，说不上好也说不上坏」。叶芝将萧伯纳描述为一台噩梦般的缝纫机，咔嗒咔嗒，闪耀着，微笑着，「永不消逝的微笑」。

无论风格是一种精神追求，还是徒有其表、华而不实，或两者兼而有之，凡是认为风格是可以选择的，不光写不好文章，也做不好任何其他事。没有哪一件事可以不用任何风格「简单」地做，因为风格是行为本身含有的，不是附加其上的。就这点而言，风格就像文本的字体。我们可能会忽略它，也确实经常忽略，但它一直在那里。我们通常注意不到无意识使用的风格，习以为常的行为好像什么风格也没有，但有经验的人很容易看到这些风格。印刷工、校对员或字体设计师不会注意不到文本的字体，但对于大多数人来说，要把那种字体和截然不同的字体放在一起才会看出差别。我们以为看的是纯粹简单的文字，没有注意到它们用了某种特定的字体。

我们做事自带某种无意识学到的风格时，不会注意到自己的行事风格。这个时候我们对行为只有抽象的概念，不会考虑到风格。我们有撒谎的概念，但不会像一位称职的调查记者一样，意识到我们实际上肯定会用某种撒谎风格：我们有争吵的概念，但不会像一位称职的婚烟顾向一样，意识到我们实际上肯定会用某种争吵风格。

尽管我们一生都在说话，但可能一直都未意识到我们有一种说话风格。美国缅因州的洋基人或路易斯安那州的南方乡村白人，觉得布鲁克林的人说话很好玩。芝加哥郊区的盎格鲁-撒克逊白人清教徒认为芝加哥的波兰人或立陶宛人说英语有口音，好像郊区的盎格鲁-撒克白人清教徒、洋基人和南方乡村白人说的是无口音的纯正美国英语一样。沿海的加州人认为 —— 就和古希腊人认为的那样 —— 所有其他人说的话听起来都很野蛮。细想一下就会明白，说话不可能没口音。但那些自认为说着本土正宗腔调的人，不会把自己的口音当口音。很难想象一个牙牙学语的孩子，会想着学习某种说话风格。学语言自然会学它自带的风格：我们自以为学了一门语言，而不是学了某个地区的方言。缅因州的孩子不会觉得他们学的是带洋基人口音的英语，他们觉得他们学的就是英语。

我们一定听过很多不同的英语口音，尽管只考虑美国这一个国家，也只有少数人会有意识地选择说话的口音。职业播音员当然会用口音；有时候对演艺事业感兴趣的人也会用口音。许多毕业于名牌大学的政治家会在不同场合用不同口音，比如在制定法律和政策的首都说一种口音，回家乡竞选公职时用完全不同的口音。参议员富布菜特是一名罗德学者，有牛津大学教育背景。去参议院之前，他曾担任法学院院长和大学校长。作为参议院外交关系委员会主席，他举行越战听证会时说话的口音完全符合他的背景；但当他在阿肯色州乡村竞选赢取选票时，听不出来一点牛津口音，甚至连费耶特维尔乡音都没有。做巡回演说时，他听起来是土生土长的本地人。选举结束回华盛顿的路上，离华盛顿越近，那种口音就越弱，直到他宣誓连任重新执掌政权时，操一口政客腔。

参议员富布赖特在巡演时能保持两种截然不同的演说风格，因为他知道两种演说都有各自的风格，所以不会把其中一种误当作纯正英语。知道自己使用的风格，他就能自如切换风格以适应不同场合。在某种程度上，每个人都会这样做，但并不是每个人都能意识到这点。那些不会特意注意自己说话风格的人，碰到某个场合不适用默认风格时，就会遇到问题。如果我们认不出自己的风格，就会困在自己的无意识风格中。当我们使用的风格实际上全都是默认风格时，我们做了选择却不自知，也就不知道可以选用更合适的风格。

无意识中掌握了整套日常会话风格的人，如果有运用风格的概念，可以为新的目的和情境再特意学一种会话风格。一位刚入职某家大公司总部的接待员，特意学会了不带个人情感色彩的标准商务会话风格。该接待员已经具备一种潜在的会话能力；为某个具体的特别目的，他特意学了一种新风格。

写作是一项活动，必然也是带着某种风格的。但是，写作和对话一样，范畴很广，不限于个别几种场合或目的。因此写作风格有很多种。和人们通常认为的不一样，没有人能掌握写作，因为写作的范围广到难以涵盖。它不是某一项技巧，也不是某几项技巧的组合。但我们很容易学会专为某种特定目的发明的写作风格，就像接待员学习会话一样。我们能看出它从哪里开始，到哪里结束，目的是什么，场景是什么，怎么选择主题。可以通过专门的学习学会这些写作风格。古典风格是这些风格中的一种。

一个人只要会阅读，基本上就会写作，但我们无意识学会的风格有些时候并不顶用。当我们在某个问题上冥思苦想得出自信的结论，想向一群固定的读者表达我们的想法，但又不知道这些读者是谁时，我们大多数人无意识学会的风格都用不上。即使是我们这个社会上学识最好的人，也很难用自己惯用的风格向外行人说明他们在某个问题上的研究成果。一些需要面向这类读者的作家发明了古典风格。它不是我们文化中的惯用风格，也不像我们大多数人学到的写作风格，它需要刻意去学才能学会。

古典风格不是某个人或某个一起工作的小团体发明出来的。它不是一次就发明出来的，也不是专为某种文化或某种语言发明出来的。古典风格被十七世纪杰出的法国作家运用得出神入化，他们的成就在法国文化中留下了英美文化不曾出现的回响。十七世纪法国的古典风格大师，因为某些原因，把自己的读者定位为聪明的外行人。他们是一群自信的作家，认定自己的话对每个读者都很重要。他们认同 —— 从某种意义上来说 —— 某件事的真相可以是所有事的真相，他们相信始终有可能向广大读者呈现真正重要的结论。

古典风格是明确的、肯定的。它的优点是清晰简单，但从某种意义上来说，这也是它的缺点。古典风格不接受模糊的表述、不必要的附加条件、支支吾吾或其他做派。它拒不承认它是一种风格。它暗自做出困难的选择，不让读者察觉。一旦决定，这些困难的选择压根不被看成是选择；它们的呈现好像非此不可一样，因为古典风格的首要特点是透明、无痕的呈现型风格。

没有确定一致风格的写作，自然不会考虑到写作能做什么，它的局限在哪，它的读者是谁，作者的目标是什么。若不对这些问题做出确切的选择，写作会很痛苦。虽然这些问题的观点不是唯一的，但每一种明确的风格必须采取一种立场。古典风格对基本问题既不会回避，也不会模棱两可。古典风格依存的假设是，人可以客观地思考，能知道客观思考的结果，呈现出来也不会有所偏倚。从这点来看，思想形成于写作之前。所有这些假设可能是错的，但它们可以帮助确立一种风格，这种风格的作用也很明显。

那些决定古典风格的态度 —— 决定任何一种风格的态度 —— 由一组基础规约构成。最开始使用古典风格的一些人，可能一直都信奉它的基础规约 —— 比如真相可知 —— 但是用这种风格写作，不需要作者信奉一组信念，只要作者愿意出于某种特定目的在一定时间内扮演一种角色即可。

这种角色受到严格的约束，因为古典风格的文章纯粹、无畏、冷静、无情。它不寻求怜悯，也不怜悯任何人，包括作者本人。尽管这样的角色必要、真实、有用，也令人激动不已，但很难长久。不管是好是坏，人类做不到纯粹、无畏、冷静或无情，即使为了达到某些目的而假装成这样很方便。以人类的条件，通常无法让古典风格作者表现出他希望的那种自主和笃定，也无法满足古典风格作者客观表达无条件真相的要求。它无法让作者一直维持古典风格要求的姿态。但古典风格就是不承认人类的实际情况。它要求漠视人人知道的事情，把读者带入这种风格中，这种漠视无法维持很长时间，而古典风格大师总能把握它的局限。古典风格是一场限时冲刺短跑。

### 1.2 Recognizing Classic Style

Classic style never became the standard for English prose that it has been at various times for French. The most admired prose writers in English have never been as successful in creating any dominant style as the most admired French prose writers of the seventeenth century were in making classic style a cultural norm. The reasons are many and defy simple summary, but they probably include the existence of an exceptionally influential line of verse writers in English — a line with no French counterpart; the profound influence of the King James translation of the Bible on English prose style; the great diversity of styles among admired English prose writers; and the fact that English prose before the eighteenth century cannot serve as a direct model for later writing. Seventeenth-century English prose seems archaic to later English readers; seventeenth-century French prose is perfectly normal even to a contemporary French reader.

Certain classic French writers — Descartes, Pascal, the duc de La Rochefoucauld, Madame de Lafayette, the Cardinal de Retz, Madame de Sévigné, and La Bruyère — have been taken as models of French prose practically from their day to ours. Indeed, for many, their French is French. Those who admire it rarely fail to single out for praise its clarity, suppleness, and elegance.

Propagandists, in the course of promoting the use of French as an international diplomatic language, attributed these marks of style to something inherent in the French language. Antoine Rivarol is the author of the best-known version of this primitive excursion into salesmanship as essentialist linguistics. Language, Professor Rivarol observes, is clear when it follows the order of reason, and unclear when it follows the movements and order of our experience. But, behold, French has a unique privilege among languages: its natural order is the order of reason. It is, therefore, necessarily clear where Greek, Latin, Italian, and English are not. In the absence of the uniquely French syntax of reason, writing in other languages is heir to all the fog and filthy air that passion and sensation impart. Rivarol won a prize for a disquisition based on these observations in the eighteenth century; today both his argument and his conclusion sound like a parody of alchemy. In the age of Derrida and Lacan, French prose has triumphantly displayed its capacity to be as incomprehensible, elephantine, and turgid as double-Dutch.

The almost transparent silliness of attributing marks of style to the inherent qualities of particular languages has not discouraged the practice even among accomplished writers who ought to know better. T. S. Eliot, in observing that English writers at no time looked to a common standard, attributes this fact to what he takes to be an inherent characteristic of the language.「The English language,」he pronounces,「is one which offers a wide scope for legitimate divergences of style; it seems to be such that no one age, and certainly no one writer, can establish a norm.」

It seems superfluous to argue that classic style does not issue from French or from any other language as such. All we have to do is look at its history. French classic style was invented by drawing together and refining attitudes and practices found in antiquity among writers of Greek and Latin, and the invaluable instrument that resulted has long been employed by classic stylists in English, although no English philosopher with the cultural standing of Descartes consistently employs it, nor was there ever such a remarkable group of classic writers in English at any one time as there was in the French grand siècle.

Consider, as an example of classic style, the following passage from La Rochefoucauld:

Madame de Chevreuse had sparkling intelligence, ambition, and beauty in plenty; she was flirtatious, lively, bold, enterprising; she used all her charms to push her projects to success, and she almost always brought disaster to those she encountered on her way.

Mme de Chevreuse avait beaucoup d'esprit, d'ambition et de beauté; elle était galante, vive, hardie, entreprenante; elle se servait de tous ses charmes pour réussir dans ses desseins, et elle a presque toujours porté malheur aux personnes qu'elle y a engagées.

This passage displays truth according to an order that has nothing to do with the process by which the writer came to know it. The writer takes the pose of full knowledge. This pose implies that the writer has wide and textured experience; otherwise he would not be able to make such an observation. But none of that personal history, personal experience, or personal psychology enters into the expression. Instead the sentence crystallizes the writer's experience into a timeless and absolute sequence, as if it were a geometric proof. The sentence has a clear direction and a goal. It leads us to that goal, which coincides with its final phrase; it is constructed to telegraph its direction. We know that it will bring us to its goal, and stop cleanly when it has done so.

By contrast, consider the opening sentence of Samuel Johnson's「Preface to Shakespeare,」which is a master's recital piece, but is not classic:

That praises are without reason lavished on the dead, and that the honours due only to excellence are paid to antiquity, is a complaint likely to be always continued by those, who, being able to add nothing to truth, hope for eminence from the heresies of paradox; or those, who, being forced by disappointment upon consolatory expedients, are willing to hope from posterity what the present age refuses, and flatter themselves that the regard which is yet denied by envy, will be at last bestowed by time.

This sentence does not telegraph its structure from the opening. We must follow it through complex and unexpected paths. In La Rochefoucauld's classic sentence, the last section is the conclusion of all that has gone before it; the beginning of the sentence exists for the end, and the sentence is constructed so that we can anticipate arriving at such a conclusion. In Johnson's sentence, by contrast, the final phrase,「flatter themselves that the regard which is yet denied by envy, will be at last bestowed by time,」is not a conclusion upon which the rest of the sentence depends. It might have come in the middle of the sentence. The end of the sentence might have been「be always continued by those, who, being able to add nothing to truth, hope for eminence from the heresies of paradox.」This does not make the sentence inadequate in any way, but it is characteristically unclassic. The classic sentence, once written, seems to have been inevitable.

La Rochefoucauld's sentence was of course difficult to write, but it looks easy. The writer hides all the effort. Johnson's sentence was clearly difficult to write, and its writer wants to display it as if it were a trophy won through his personal effort.

La Rochefoucauld's classic sentence pretends that it could be said. It would take a true master of speech to construct such a sentence spontaneously. In fact we sense that the rhythm is too perfect to be spontaneous. Still, it sounds like ideally efficient and precise speech. If angels spoke French, it would sound like this. Johnson's sentence, by contrast, can only be writing that took effort. In its rhythms, we do not hear someone speaking spontaneously. One could memorize it and repeat it in speech, but even then it would sound like memorized writing, not like speech. In the theology behind Johnson's sentence, writing is hard and noble, because truth is the reward of effort and cannot be captured in spontaneous speech. In the theology behind La Rochefoucauld's sentence, writing should look easy even as it looks masterful. Truth is a grace that flees from earnest effort. The language of truth is ideally graceful speech.

La Rochefoucauld's sentence is a prototype of classic style. The conceptual and linguistic environment associated with classic style is extremely rich and complex. No classic text — not even a prototype — incorporates all of it. Any list of criteria would be misconceived: some texts lack central attributes of classic style and yet are obviously classic; other texts are faintly classic throughout; still others have isolated parts that are strongly classic; some texts incorporate only a few elements of classic style; some clearly unclassic texts contain marks of classic style; some texts have the verbal marks of classic style but none of its theology; some texts lie between classic style and another style.

Consider the gradient between plain style and classic style.「The truth is pure and simple」is plain style.「The truth is rarely pure, and never simple」is classic style. The plain version contains many elements of classic style without being classic; the classic version contains all of the plain version without being plain.

The concept of classic style assumes that plain style already exists. The classic version introduces a refinement, a qualification, a meditation on the plain version that makes it classic. Classic style takes the attitude that it is superior to plain style because classic style presents intelligence as it should be presented: as a sparkling display, not weighed down by grinding earnestness. The classic writer wants to be distinguished from others because she assumes that truth, though potentially available to all, is not the common property of common people, and that it is not to be perceived or expressed through common means unrefined. The classic writer sees common sense as only an approximation which, left untested and unrefined, can turn out to be false. The plain writer wants to be common because she assumes that truth is the common property of common people, directly perceived and expressed through common means. For the plain writer, common sense is truth. Unlike plain style, classic style is aristocratic, which is not to say artificially restricted, since anyone can become an aristocrat by learning classic style. Anyone who wants to can attain classic style, but classic style views itself as an intellectual achievement, not a natural endowment.

There are many features of classic style besides a simple and elegant shape and the introduction of some refinement in the thought. Behind these features is a complicated, polished, and fascinating view of truth and language, writers and readers. The rest of this essay is an attempt to lay out the features of classic style and their underlying conceptual stand.

1.2 辨识古典风格

古典风格从来不是英语散文的典范，但曾在不同的时代被尊为法语散文的典范。十七世纪最负盛名的法语散文作家把古典风格推为一种文化规范，历代才华出众的英语散文作家在创造任何一种主流风格上从未取得如此成就。其原因有很多，并非三言两语可以概括，但很可能有以下几个原因：1）历史上有一大批影响深远的英语诗歌创作者，其数量之多非法语作家能比拟；2）钦定版圣经（KJV）对英语散文风格产生了深刻影响；3）杰出的英语散文作家创造了非常多元化的写作风格；4）十八世纪以前的英语散文很难成为后世直接模仿的典范。十七世纪的英语散文对后来的英文读者来说似乎过时了，而十七世纪的法语散文甚至在当代法语读者看来也极为日常。

一些古典风格法语作家 —— 笛卡儿（Descartes）、帕斯卡（Pascal）、弗朗索瓦·德·拉罗什福科（the duc de La Rochefoucauld）、拉法耶特夫人（Madame de Lafayette）、莱兹（the Cardinal de Retz）、塞维涅夫人（Madame de Sevigne）及拉布吕耶尔（La Bruyere）—— 几乎自他们的时代起直至今天，一直都是法语散文作家的模范。事实上，对多数人而言，他们的法语才是真正的法语。欣赏法语散文的人，说起它的优点很少不提到它清晰、灵活与优雅的特点。

法语宣扬者在推行法语作为国际外交用语时，把这些风格特征归于法语固有的一些东西。安托万·里瓦罗尔（Antoine de Rivarol）2 是早期本质主义语言学著作写得最好的作者。里瓦罗尔观察到，语言遵循推理顺序时很清晰，遵循我们体验的活动及顺序时则不清晰。但要注意的是，在众多语言中，法语有一个独特的优势，即它固有的顺序正好就是推理顺序。因此，那些希腊语、拉丁语、意大利语和英语说不明白的地方，用法语就能讲明白。因为其他语言没有法语特有的推理句法，写出来的文章承袭的是激情和感受散发出来的所有迷雾和浊气。十八世纪，里瓦罗尔根据这些观察结果写过专题论述，还获得了表彰。今天看来，他的论证过程及结论，听起来像模仿拙劣的炼金术。德里达（Derrida）及拉康（Lacan）的时代，写出来的法语文章如「天书」一般晦涩难懂、臃肿乏味。

2『第一次知道法语的一个特点：其固有的顺序正好是推理顺序。做一张任意卡片。（2022-03-05）』—— 已完成

即使是才华横溢的作家也未能幸免，他们本应见多识广，却也犯下这般显而易见的错误，认为风格特征是特定语言固有的优势。TS. 艾略特 (TS. Eio）注意到英语作家从不参照共同标准，但他把这个事实归咎于所谓的英语固有特征。他说：「英语语言，为合理多样化的风格提供了广阔的空间，似乎没有哪一段时期，当然也没有哪一位作家，能建立某种范式。」3

古典风格并非发源于法语或任何其他语言，说这话似乎有些多余。

我们回看古典风格的历史就知道了。古典风格源自对古代希腊语作家和拉丁语作家的态度及实践的总结提炼，英语古典风格作家长期以来一直受用于这种宝贵经验，只是说没有哪位资深的英语哲学家像笛卡儿那样一以贯之地使用这种风格，也没有哪个时期像法国「大世纪」时期一样涌现出一批杰出的英语古典风格作家。

我们举一段拉罗什福科的话作为古典风格的例子：

选段 1-1

谢弗勒兹夫人光芒四射，集智慧、抱负和美丽于一身；她风情万千、活泼大胆、勇于开拓：她动用她全部的魅力，争取把事情办成功，在这过程中她几乎总是给那些她碰到的人带来灾难。4

这段话展示真相的顺序和作者实际认识真相的过程无关。作者是以一种全知的姿态，这种姿态暗示作者有细致入微的丰富体验，不然他无法做出这样的观察。但他的表达没有混杂任何个人历史、个人经历或个人心理。相反，这句话将作者的经历凝结成一组永恒且绝对的序列，就像这种经历是一个几何证明题。这个句子有清晰的方向和目标。它把我们引向那个目标，与它末尾的短语交汇；句子组织起来是为了指明它的方向。我们知道它会把我们引向它的目标，一旦做到即刻终止。

我们再看看一个对比的例子，出自塞缪尔·约翰逊（Samuel Johnson）《莎士比亚戏剧集序言》（Preface to Shakespeare）的开头几句，这是大师的独奏曲，但不是古典风格：

我们可能永远听到有人抱怨说我们对于死人妄加赞扬，说我们对古人怀着他们不应得到的尊敬，这种尊敬只有真正优秀的作家才配享受。什么人常说这样的抱怨话呢？他们可能是这样一种人：虽然他们的话不能算是真理，他们却想靠着发表似是而非的谬论而出名：他们也可能是另一类的人：这些人由于不得志而不得不设法安慰自己，因此希望他们在当代所不能获得的名誉地位，后代的人会送给他们，因此他们妄想他们由于妒忌而受不到重视，最后时间会给他们带来人们对他们的重视。5

我们无法从这句话的开头看出它的结构。要理解它，我们必须穿过复杂难料的小径。在拉罗什福科的古典句子中，最后部分是前面所有内容的总结，句子开头是为了结尾而存在，句子组织起来就是让我们能够预料这样的结论。相反，在约翰逊的句子中，最后一句「因此他们妄想他们由于妒忌而受不到重视，最后时间会给他们带来人们对他们的重视」，并不是句子前面部分依存的结论。它可能应该出现在句子中间。用作结尾的句子可能是「虽然他们的话不能算是真理，他们却想靠着发表似是而非的谬论而出名」。不是说这样的句子不完整，但它显然不是古典的。古典句子一旦写出来，似乎就非此不可了。

拉罗什福科的句子当然不好写，但看起来简单。作者隐藏了所有努力。约翰逊的句子显然也很难写，但它的作者将这种困难展现出来，好像举着认可个人努力的奖杯一样。

拉罗什福科的古典句子可以当作口头说出来的。只有真正的演讲大家才能即兴造出这样的句子。事实上我们感觉到，节奏如此完美的句子不可能随口说出。但它听起来是完美精炼的。如果天使说法语，听起来大概就是这样。相比之下，约翰逊的句子只能是费脑筋的写作。从它的节奏，我们听不出是某人的即兴发言。人们可以先记住这句话，然后口头上复述出来，就算这样，听着还是像背诵书面文字，而不像讲话。约翰逊的句子背后的观念是，写作是一件既困难又崇高的事情，因为真相是作者煞费苦心获得的奖励，无法在即兴发言中捕捉到。而拉罗什福科的句子背后的观念是，即使写得精彩，也应该看起来简单。真相是苦心经营后仅存的一丝优雅。表达真相的语言是完美优雅的。

拉罗什福科的句子是古典风格的典范之作。与古典风格相关的概念环境和语言环境纷繁复杂。没有一篇古典文本能涵盖全部要素，典范之作也做不到。列出任何一条标准都无法全面涵盖：有些文本虽不具备古典风格的核心特征但显然是古典风格；另一些文本通篇没有明显的古典风格痕迹；有些文本的个别片段是明显的古典风格；有些文本只包含古典风格的少许要素；有些明显不是古典风格的文本却具备古典风格的特征；有些文本的语言特征是古典风格，背后的观念跟古典风格一点关系都没有；有些文本介于古典风格和其他风格之间。

看看平实风格和古典风格之间的过渡界限。「真相纯粹且简单」（The truth is pure and simple）是平实风格。「真相很少纯粹，也绝不简单」6（The truth is rarely pure, and never simple）是古典风格。平实风格的句子包含许多古典风格元素，却不是古典风格；古典风格的句子包含平实风格的全部元素，却不是平实风格。

古典风格认定平实风格是前提条件。平实风格的句子经过提炼、限定和琢磨，可以变成古典风格。古典风格的态度是它优于平实风格，因为古典风格以展示智慧的方式展示智慧：机智风趣地闪现，而非束手束脚地一本正经。古典风格作者想区别于他人，因为他认为尽管人人都可能知道真相，但真相不是普通大众共同享有的财富，也无法通过不经提炼的一般方式观察或表达。古典风格作者认为常识只是一种粗略认识，这种认识未经检验和提炼，可能是错的。平实风格作者希望大众化，因为他认为真相是大众的共同财富，可以用一般方式直接观察和表达。对平实风格作者来说，常识就是真相。与平实风格不同，古典风格是贵族风格，这不是说要人为限制，因为任何人都可以通过学习古典风格成为贵族的一员。只要想学，任何人都能学会古典风格，但古典风格本身是一种脑力成果，而不是一种天赋异禀。

2『这一节开始设计本书的核心概念「古典风格」了，古典风格做一张主题卡片。（2022-03-05）』—— 已完成

除了句子简单优雅、思想精炼，古典风格还有很多其他特征。这些特征源自对真相和语言、作者和读者的立场，这种立场复杂、优雅又迷人。在本篇，我们会尝试阐明古典风格的特征及其隐含的概念立场。

### 1.3 The Elements of Style

Elementary does not always mean easy. It often means fundamental. Euclid's mathematical classic is called The Elements of Geometry. If we ask what Euclid means by「elements,」we will discover that they consist of a short list of twenty-three definitions, such as「a line is breadthless length,」five postulates, such as「all right angles are equal to one another,」and five common notions, such as「if equals be added to equals, the wholes are equal.」From these elements, all of Euclid's geometry follows. For a mathematical genius like Sir Isaac Newton, the book is really over once these elements are laid out, since everything else is implicit within them. The Elements of Geometry, the most successful textbook in history, establishes a set of expectations for other textbooks that present the structure of a field. So, when we look into a book called The Elements of Accounting or The Elements of Boatbuilding or the elements of anything — every field has at least half a dozen books with such a title — we expect what we find in Euclid: a small number of starting points at a high level of generality from which all the details of the subject follow.

In the eighteenth century, when chemistry was separated from alchemy, the field came to be structured around the concept of chemical elements, only a handful of which were known. Chemical elements, like Euclid's elements, are the fundamental starting points of their domain; unlike Euclid's elements, they are also elemental in constituting everything more complex. The origin of this concept of chemical elements is often attributed to Antoine Lavoisier (1743–1794), whose presentation in Traité élémentaire de chemie, presenté dans un ordre nouveau et d'après les découvertes modernes (1789) was embraced by almost everyone who read it, partly because he wrote in classic style; other books on the subject were written in styles too complicated to be widely understood.

The concept of chemical elements is similar to Euclid's concept of elements, inasmuch as everything in the domain of chemistry can be said to be implicit in them. Even today, when there are 118 elements instead of the handful known to Lavoisier, it is possible to put them all on a chart inside the cover of a chemistry textbook or on the wall of a classroom. The concept that all matter is a combination of elements is fundamental to the science of chemistry; but some of these elements are less central as constituents than others. Oxygen, for example, is central; unnamed elements that are known to exist but have not been isolated experimentally are peripheral. The physical world, unlike geometry, is not invented. There are a multitude of geometries that derive from a multitude of starting points. There is only one physical world, whose starting point is not a human invention. So while the concept「elemental atom」is fundamental and distinct, the actual table of these elements has slightly fuzzy margins. New elements have been added or created within the past fifty years, but they are all exotic and have little to do with our understanding of the fundamental nature of the chemical world.

The periodic table of chemical elements is implicitly modeled on the alphabet. The chemical elements are a kind of alphabet of the physical world. The Roman alphabet, used to write English and most European languages, is itself a set of elements. With just twenty-six letters, we can write every word in these languages, even words that are obsolete, even tomorrow's words that have not yet been coined. When the letters of this alphabet are arranged on a typewriter keyboard, we can see that while they are not all equally important — we would miss the z if it were broken a lot less than the e — they exist like Euclid's axioms on the same level of generality; they are all fundamental: no one of them derives from any other. When the original typewriter keyboard became the more complex computer keyboard, it was expanded. It added exotic function keys, all of which are convenient, none of which is elementary in the sense that the letters of the alphabet are elementary. The computer keyboard, like the table of chemical elements, acknowledges in its spatial layout the marginal nature of the exotic additions.

Elements in all of these cases are definite and few and are the starting points of everything in their domain. We should expect the same limits to apply to the elements of prose style. These elements cannot be an indefinite and miscellaneous list of surface features and mechanical rules. The authors of this book think the elements of style legitimately can be expressed as a short series of questions concerning a set of relationships among truth, presentation, writer, reader, thought, and language. These questions are addressed to fundamental issues that must be answered deliberately or by default before we can write at all. The issues are all on the same fundamental level. None concerns a surface phenomenon — like sentence length — and however closely related they are, none derives from another.

These questions concern a series of relationships: What can be known? What can be put into words? What is the relationship between thought and language? Who is the writer addressing and why? What is the implied relationship between writer and reader? What are the implied conditions of discourse? In any given style, positions will be assigned to truth, language, the writer, and the reader. Classic style is a group of closely related decisions. It defines roles and creates a distinctive network of relationships; it takes a consistent stand on the elements of style. Other stands constitute other styles.

The concept that a style follows from a set of fundamental decisions is commonplace in musicology and art history. For example, when Charles Rosen describes the origins of the classical style in music, he begins by describing what he calls「needs」that the existing high baroque style was incapable of meeting. In Rosen's analysis, high baroque style was invented to present static states: it rendered sentiment or a theatrical moment of crisis. Classical style was invented to present dynamic action. Handel, a master of high baroque style, juxtaposed different emotions. Mozart, a master of classical style, represents a single character passing from one emotion to another in a sequence. In Rosen's formula,「Dramatic sentiment was replaced by dramatic action.」Classical style differs from the style of the high baroque because it has made different decisions about the object of presentation. Although it is possible to catalogue surface differences between high baroque style and classical style, the motive and character of the change cannot be understood as a replacement of one set of surface features by another. For Rosen, the first significant examples of the capacity of the classical style to represent dramatic sequence are to be found in the harpsichord sonatas of Domenico Scarlatti. Scarlatti made classical decisions about fundamental questions although he lacked many of the surface features of the style:「the changes of texture in his sonatas are the dramatic events, clearly set off and outlined, that were to become central to the style of the generations that came after him.」「Although there is little sign in his works of the classical technique of transition from one kind of rhythm to another, there is already an attempt to make a real dramatic clash in the changes of key. . . .」

In art history as well, there is normally an awareness that style follows from fundamental decisions rather than surface features. Émile Mâle, in his analysis of the iconographic sources of religious art in Western Europe, for example, notes that theologians of the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries share a conception of the world as a「vast symbol.」But while this theological concept of the world as an integrated symbolic form is the source of the stylistic decisions of the thirteenth century, it has no such role in the style of religious art of the fifteenth century. In Mâle's words,「A profound symbolism had governed the arrangement of the sculptured figures on the portals of . . . thirteenth-century churches,」so that「the statues of Chartres formed a perfectly coherent system of ideas.」

By contrast, the fifteenth-century façade of Saint-Vulfran at Abbéville, which Mâle describes as magnificent and compares for its beauty and the richness of its decoration to the great achievements of the thirteenth century, is stylistically a world away from the thirteenth-century conception of a church as a learned encyclopedia. The style of the sculptural program of Saint-Vulfran is not informed by any such governing plan because, in common with the other great achievements in religious art of its century, it does not derive from a symbolic conception of the universe. The symbolism of the thirteenth century that was the foundation of a style of iconography has yielded to a less learned, less literary style of iconography in the fifteenth. Sentiment and emotion have replaced symbol and encyclopedic organization.

The thesis that a style follows from a set of fundamental decisions and not from a catalogue of surface features is far less common in books about style in writing. Almost every book about writing contains the word「style」in its title or as a significant section heading, and many magazines and journals include a style sheet defining their house style. Let us consider a selection of these: The Chicago Manual of Style, the MLA Style Manual, the final section (「Style」) of The Harvest Reader, chapter 6 (「Style」) of Kate Turabian's Manual for Writers of Term Papers, Theses, and Dissertations, Strunk and White's The Elements of Style, and Joseph M. Williams's summary of his collaboration with Gregory Colomb, Style: Toward Clarity and Grace.

The word「style」does not mean the same thing to the writers of these guides, textbooks, and manuals. In The Chicago Manual of Style,「style」refers to those arbitrary decisions that must be made for consistency's sake in copy text, but have no consequence for intellectual content or conceptual organization. For example, with respect to intellectual content or conceptual organization, it makes no difference how a date is written — 「March 24, 1954」or「24 March 1954」 — but it is desirable that dates be written in a consistent manner throughout a text, and The Chicago Manual of Style gives a standard, arbitrary way to achieve consistency.「Style」here means necessary but arbitrary decisions about surface features of copy text.

Joseph Williams's Style, by contrast, views surface features of copy text as peripheral to its project, which is to explain how to revise「pointed」prose so that it can be easily parsed.

Yet all six of our selections, which stand for an indefinite number of others, characterize「style」as something external to the core decisions that define style in the sense that Rosen and Mâle have discussed it.

The MLA Style Manual is just a shorter and arbitrarily different version of The Chicago Manual of Style. Kate Turabian offers rules — many of them「adapted from The Chicago Manual of Style, 13th edition」 — suitable for term papers. The final section (「Style」) in The Harvest Reader implies that style is a decorative element that comes after all the serious work has been completed, like paint on a house.

Even Strunk and White's famous textbook The Elements of Style — whose title might lead you to expect a writer's equivalent to Euclid's Elements of Geometry — treats style as composed of distinguishing surface marks. If you open Euclid's Elements to the first page, you see a few fundamental definitions and axioms. If you open Strunk and White's Elements to the first page, you see:

1 Form the possessive singular of nouns by adding's.

Follow this rule whatever the final consonant. Thus write,

Charles's friend

Burns's poems

the witch's malice.

Exceptions are the possessives of ancient proper names in -es and -is, the possessive Jesus', and such forms as for conscience' sake, for righteousness' sake.

If you look at chapter 5,「An Approach to Style,」where the authors propose to treat「style in its broader meaning,」you will find a discussion not of core decisions but rather of「what is distinguished and distinguishing」about the surface of language:「When we speak of Fitzgerald's style, . . . we mean the sound his words make on paper.」

In Strunk and White, all style is finally said to be a「high mystery」because it cannot be learned from a catalogue of the only elements of style that they consider, the surface elements.「Who knows why certain notes in music are capable of stirring the listener deeply, though the same notes slightly rearranged are impotent?」Charles Rosen, working from the core decisions that define a musical style, rather than from individual notes, sees an intelligible historical process instead of high mystery.

Joseph Williams's book, Style, is completely free of high mystery and intelligently suspicious of rules of usage. Even his final chapter,「Usage,」which treats basic rules, regards points of usage as peripheral to writing. Style is entirely invulnerable to any accusation that it offers a mechanical approach to writing since it is quite explicit that it is not a guide to writing at all but rather a guide to solving a problem in writing: if the writer has finished the intellectual work of writing and has written a draft, but finds that his text frustrates his reader's attempt to understand it, then Style will show the writer ways to change the structure of expression so as to accommodate the reader's routines. To this extent, Williams's approach to style is distinguished from that of everyone else on our list. His book is not meant as a guide to arbitrary conventions or matters of taste but rather as a model of how people read what Williams calls「pointed discourse」 — which includes arguments, instructions, memos, and so on. Knowing this model allows a writer to shape his discourse to fit the expectations of his readers. Williams's book is effective and helpful as a guide to higher mechanics. But it presents itself as concerned with revision — an activity independent of decisions on the fundamental questions of truth, language, reader, and writer. In this way, Williams inadvertently and inevitably presents himself as describing style, rather than a style. There is a consistent set of decisions on fundamental matters lying behind the style Williams treats, but he does not acknowledge them or acknowledge that there are alternatives.

For every item on our list that treats prose style, there is an assumption made at the beginning that is linked to a mistake that comes at the end. If you start off with the view of style as a list of surface mechanical elements at any level, then you can end up with the correct list and present it as constituting style, rather than a style.

In music and in painting, different fundamental decisions define different styles. In geometry or logic, different fundamental axioms define different systems. In writing, different stands on the elements of style define different families of prose styles. A failure to view style as a fundamental stand on central issues entails a failure to see the possibility of other stands that constitute other styles.

The domain of style is what can be chosen. A fundamental stand is a choice open to the writer. By contrast, to know a language is to know a great range of things that are not open to choice: it is not open to every writer, for example, to decide that sentences shall begin with a period and end with a capital letter, that the word「dog」shall refer to cats, that predicates shall not agree in number and person with their subjects, or that six fine brick houses shall be called「brick fine houses six.」You can, however, decide whether to call a certain dog a「dog」or a「hound,」to say「Sally devoured the roast beef」rather than「The roast beef was devoured by Sally,」to write in sentences that are short and clipped rather than baroque and periodic, or to write「24 March 1954」rather than「March 24, 1954,」but these are surface features. Books that talk about style in writing treat these moments of choice at the surface level but typically ignore the elements of style, which is to say, the fundamental choices from which surface features derive.

We propose to describe the fundamental questions that are the elements of style in writing, and the answers to these questions that define classic style. The elements come under five topical headings: truth, presentation, scene, cast, thought and language.

0201 风格要素与古典立场

1.3 风格的要素 ①

① 标题及正文中的「要素」与正文《几何原本》《会计学基础》中的「原本」和「基础」均对应同一个英文单词 Elements —— 译者注

基础（Elementary）并不总是意味着简单。它常有不可或缺之意。欧几里得的数学经典被称为《几何原本》（The Elements of Geometry），如果我们问欧几里得「原本」（elements）指什么，我们会发现，它们被列成二十三条定义（如「线只有长度而没有宽度」）、五大公设（如「凡是直角都相等」）和五大公理（如「等量加等量，其和相等」）。这些要素是欧几里得整个几何体系发展的基础。对于艾萨克·牛顿爵士这样的数学天才来说，这本书把这些要素逐一列出来也就结束了，因为所有其他含义都隐含其中。《几何原本》是历史上最成功的教科书，在阐述领域体系上为其他教科书树立了一组标杆。因此，当我们查看一本《会计学基础》（The Elements of Accounting）或《造船术基础》（The Elements of Boatbuilding）或任一领域基础的书时，我们想看的是欧几里得那样的书：从一小部分高度概括的基础定理延伸出科学的所有细节。

十八世纪，化学从炼金术中独立出来，开始围绕化学元素的概念构建体系，当时为人所知的化学元素只有很少一部分。化学元素，像欧几里得的几何要素，是所在领域的核心基点，不同的是，它们也是构成所有更复杂事物的基础。化学元素这个概念一般来说是安托万·拉瓦锡（Antoine Lavoiser, 1743-1794）的首创，读过他的《化学基础论》（Traitelementaire de chemie, presente dans un ordre noveau etdapresles decouvertes modernes,1789）的人几乎没有不喜欢的，部分原因是这本书的写作风格正是古典风格；该主题的其他书因写作风格太复杂，未能被广泛普及。

1-3『看到拉瓦锡以及他「化学基础论」好亲切，之前研读过，而且拉瓦锡（1743-1794）之前记录进牛人卡片里，而且知道他是法国大革命时被砍的头，因之前是个官员，拉格朗日为其惋惜。（2022-03-06）』

化学元素的概念可以类比欧几里得几何要素的概念，在化学学科中，一切事物都隐含在化学元素中。即使现在发现的 118 种化学元素远超过拉瓦锡当时知道的数量，也全都能收录在化学教材封面内侧或者教室墙上的元素周期表中。所有物质都由化学元素组合而成，这个概念是化学学科的基础；但是有些化学元素作为组成成分，不如其他元素重要。比如，氧元素很重要，但未命名的元素 —— 即使知道它们的存在 —— 因没有通过实验分离出来所以不那么重要。

跟几何体系不一样，自然世界不是发明出来的。根据几何的众多基点，该学科可以划分成不同分支。而自然世界只有一个，它的学科基点并非人类发明。因此，尽管「基础原子」这个概念很重要也很明晰，但这些元素实际所处的列表仍有些许模糊和空白。过去五十年新添加或新发明的元素，都是新异元素，与我们以识化学世界的基本性质没有太大关系。

化学元素周期表完全是模仿字母表。化学元素是物质世界的一种字母组合。作为英语及大部分欧洲语言的书写字母，罗马字母本身是一组元素。我们可以用二十六个字母写出这些语言的每个单词，甚至那些过时的单词，又甚至尚未造出来的新词。当把这些字母排列组合在打字机键盘上时，我们可以看到，虽然这些字母不是同等重要 —— E 键的缺失会比 Z 键的缺失更让人想念 —— 但它们像欧几里得定理一样普遍；它们都不可替代：没有哪个是从另一个派生而来的。当原先的打字机键盘变成更复杂的计算机键盘时，键盘也跟着扩增。它增加了新异功能键，它们都很方便，但不像字母表中的字母一样基础。计算机键盘与化学元素周期表一样，在空间布局上考虑了新异元素的边缘性质。

这些例子中的要素都很确定且数量不多，是各自领域一切事物的基点。文本风格的要素也应该具备类似条件。这些要素不可能是五花八门、模棱两可的表面特征和死板规则。笔者认为，风格要素可以表达为对一组关系提出的系列问题 —— 真相、呈现、作者、读者、思想和语言，以及它们两两之间的关系。这些基础问题在我们写作之前必须有意识或无意识地回答出来。这些问题都是同等基础的问题。没有哪个关注表面现象 —— 比如句子的长短 —— 也没有哪一个由另一个派生而来，不论相互关系多么紧密。

这些问题问的是一系列关系：什么是可知的？什么可以用言语表达？思想和语言的关系是什么？作者对话的读者是谁？为什么是他们？作者与读者之间的内在关系是什么？言语交流的隐含条件是什么？任何一种确定的风格，都会对真相、语言、作者及读者采取一种立场。古典风格是一组密切相关的决定。它确立了角色，而且创建出一种独特的关系网络；它对风格要素采取一致的立场。采取的立场不同，形成的风格也不同。

风格源于一组基本立场（Fundamental Decisions），这种概念在音乐学和艺术史上很常见。比如，查尔斯·罗森（Charles Rosen）说到古典风格音乐的起源时，首先讲的是当时巴洛克盛期风格无法满足的他称为「需求」的东西。罗森分析，巴洛克盛期风格是为了表现静止状态：表达情绪或某个戏剧性的危急时刻。古典风格是为了表现动态行为。巴洛克盛期风格大师亨德尔（Handel）会同时表现不同的情绪。古典风格大师莫扎特表现的是某个场景中的个体人物从一种情绪进入另一种情绪。按罗森的话说，「戏剧性行为取代了戏剧性情绪」。古典风格不同于巴洛克盛期风格是因为它对事物的呈现做出了不同的决定。虽然可以列出古典风格和吧洛克盛期风格的表面差异，但不能把这种变化的根源和特点理解为一组表面特征替换了另一组表面特征。罗森认为，多梅尼科·斯卡拉蒂（Domenico Scarlatti）的羽管键琴奏鸣曲是古典风格表现戏剧性场景的首批重要代表作。斯卡拉蒂的作品尽管缺乏古典风格的许多表面特征，但在基本问题上采取的是古典风格立场：「其奏鸣曲的格调变化表现为戏剧性事件，有明确的起点和发展脉络，对后代音乐家的风格产生了重要影响。」「虽然他的作品没有表现出从一种韵律过渡到另一种韵律的古典风格技巧，但在音调变化上，他已经表达出了真正的戏剧性冲突......」1

艺木史领域也有这种普遍的认识，风格源于基本立场而不是表面特征。比如，埃米尔·马勒（Emile Male）分析西欧宗教艺术图像的起源时指出，十三至十五世纪的神学家都把世界看成一个「巨大的图形符号」。这种把世界当作统一符号形式的概念是十三世纪的宗教艺术风格确立的基础，但在十五世纪的宗教艺术风格中并不是这样的。马勒写道，「深邃的象征主义主导了十三世纪教堂…...门廊雕像的排列」，因此「沙特尔大教堂的雕像形成了一种浑然天成的思想体系」。26

相比之下，十五世纪法国阿布维尔的圣乌勒弗兰大教堂（Saint-Vulfran）的正门 —— 马勒称其宏伟壮观，并把它的华美与丰富装饰与十三世纪的杰出作品相比 —— 与十三世纪百科全书式的教学风格有天壤之别。圣乌勒弗兰大教堂的雕塑项目没有受到任何此类风格理念的影响，因为它与同世纪其他杰出宗教艺术作品一样，并不把世界看成符号。作为符号风格基础的十三世纪象征主义，发展到十五世纪后少了深奥和书卷气。情感和情绪取代了图形符号和百科全书式结构。风格源于一组基本立场而不是一系列表面特征，这种论点很少出现在谈论写作风格的书中。几乎每一本关于写作的书都会在书名或者某个重要章节标题上用到「风格」这个词，很多杂志期刊还会专门出一页格式须知规定出版样式。

我们可以举其中几个例子：《芝加哥风格手册》（The Chicago Manual of Style）①、《MLA 风格手册》（MLA Style Manual）、《丰收的读者》（The Harvest Reader）最后一章「风格」、凯特·杜拉宾（KateTb）《芝加哥大学论文写作指南》（Manual for writers for Term Papers, Theses, and Dissertations）第六章「风格」、斯特伦克（Strunk）和怀特（White）合著的《风格的要素》（The Elements of Style）及约瑟夫·M. 威廉姆斯（Joseph M. Williams）为他与格雷戈里·卡洛姆（Gregory Colomb）的合作写的摘要《风格：清晰、优雅的写作》（Syle: Toward Clarity and Grace）①。

① 此书有经济新潮社出版的繁体中文版《英文写作的魅力》，陈佳伶译。—— 译者注

这些指南、教材和手册所说的「风格」不是同一回事。《芝加哥风格手册》中的「风格」是一种必要的随机决定，以保证印刷文本的统一，但对思想内容或概念组织来说则无关紧要。比如就思想内容或概念组织而言，日期 1954 年 3 月 24 日是写成「March24, 1954」还是「24 March 1954」没有区别，但一篇文章中的日期应按统一格式书写，而《芝加哥风格手册》用一种随即标准保持统一。这里的「风格」是对印刷文本表面特征随机做出的必要决定。

与之相反，约瑟夫·M 威廉姆斯的《风格：清晰、优雅的写作》一书认为印刷文本的表面特征对他所说的风格无关紧要，他的风格是为了说明如何改进「观点文本」（Pointed prose）以便读者理解。

而我们上面试举出的六种风格只是管中窥豹（类似的例子不胜枚举），它们讨论的「风格」不涉及罗森和马勒所说的那种能定义风格的核心立场。

《MLA 风格手册》只是《芝加哥风格手册》的缩略版，两者的差异随机而定。凯特·杜拉宾的格式要求有很多「从《芝加哥风格手册》第 13 版改编过来」，适用于学期论文。而《丰收的读者》（The Harvest Reader）的最后一章「风格」表明风格是完成全部重要工作之后的一种装饰性元素，就像刷房子的油漆。

甚至斯特伦克和怀特的著名教科书《风格的要素》认为风格由明显的表面特征构成，书名也许会让你联想到欧几里得的《几何原本》。如果翻到《几何原本》第一页，你会看到一些基础的定义和公理，但翻到《风格的要素》第一页，你看到的是：

单数名词构成所有格加「's」

不管单数名词以什么辅音字母结尾，必须遵守这条规则。例如：

Charles's friend（查理的朋友）

Burns's poems（彭斯的诗）

the witch's malice（妖妇的毒心）

例外的情况也是有的，是指一些以 -es 或 -is 结尾的古代专有名词或古代习用词组，其所有格仅需加「'」。例如 Jesus'（耶稣的），for conscience' sake（为了良心），for righteousness' sake（为了正义）① 。

① 汉译文出自陈一鸣翻译版本，本书其他《风格的要素》选段均出自该版本，该版本书名汉译文为《英文写作指南》。—— 译者注

假如你看第五章「认识风格」，作者意在探讨「更广义的风格」，你会发现作者谈的不是核心决定，而是类似如何区分「distinguishing」和「distinguished」的显著语言表面特征：「当我们谈及菲茨杰拉德的风格时…...我们说的是他的文字在纸上发出的声音。」

斯特伦克和怀特把整个风格说成一种「高深莫测的东西」，因为仅仅学会一条条唯一要素（他们认为的表面要素），无法学会风格。「谁知道一些触动人心的音符为什么稍稍重组就不再动人了呢？」查尔斯·罗森考虑的是确立音乐风格的核心决定，而不是单个音符，他眼中的风格是一种可理解的历史进程，而不是高深莫测的东西。

约瑟夫·威廉姆斯的《风格》一书，不说高深莫测的东西，而是明智地怀疑用法规则。即便最后一章「用法」讨论了基本规则，也只是把这些用法知识点当成写作的次要技巧。没人会指责《风格》给出了一种技巧性的写作方法，因为它明确指出它不会指导你怎么写，而是指导你如何解决写作遇到的问题：假如作者已经想好了要写什么，也拟好了草稿，但是发现他的文本不能被读者理解，这时候《风格》就会告诉作者如何改变表达结构以适应读者的阅读习惯。这就是威廉姆斯的方法与我们前述所有其他人的方法的不同之处。威廉姆斯的书不是指导随机惯用表达或个人喜好的手册，而是示范如何阅读他说的「应用文」—— 包括议论文、说明文和备忘录等。了解这种范文格式后，作者就能调整论文，以便符合读者的预期。咸廉姆斯的书作为一本高等技巧指导书效果显著。但它表现的是一种修改活动 —— 与真相、语言、读者和作者这些基本问题的决定无关。从这点来说，威廉姆斯论述的是笼统的风格，不是具体某种风格。威廉姆斯所述风格已然对基本问题做出一组统一的决定，但他没有承认这些决定或承认它们可供选择。

我们列出的每本谈论风格的书，一开始提出的假设注定了最终的错误。如果一开始你就认为风格无论怎么看都是一组表面的技巧性要素清单，那你有可能学会这份清单，表现出风格，但不是特定某种风格。

在音乐和绘画领域，基本立场不同则风格不同。在几何学或逻辑学领域，基本公理不同则体系不同。在写作上，对风格要素采取的立场不同则文本风格的类型不同。只有把风格看作对核心问题采取的一种基本立场，才可能看到由其他立场构成的其他风格。

风格可以自主选择。基本立场可以由作者自主选择。相反，了解一门语言却要掌握很多不能自主选择的东西，比如每个作者都不能自由决定句子开头应用句号，最后一个字母应大写，「狗」这个词应指代猫，谓语不应与主语的单复数和人称一致，六座漂亮的砖房应说成「砖漂亮的房六座」。但你可以选择用「狗」还是「猎狗」来称呼某只狗，说「萨利大口吃着烤牛肉」而不说「烤牛肉被萨利大口吃着」，用小短句而不是巴洛克风格的华丽辞藻和长圆周句；或者把日期 1954 年 3 月 24 日写成「24 March 1954」，而不是「March 24, 1954」，但这些都是表面特征。谈论写作风格的书只是从表面上决定这些选择，一般都忽略了风格的要素 —— 表面特征的基本选择。

我们接下来会逐一介绍这些基本问题，即风格的要素，以及古典风格对这些问题的回答。这些要素分别是真相、呈现、场景、角色、思想和语言。

### 1.4 The Classic Stand on the Elements of Style

1.4 古典风格的立场

#### 1.4.1 Truth

René Descartes provides a kind of philosophic patronage for classic style in its seventeenth-century French expression. Because the fundamental problem he addresses and the solution he offers commanded attention throughout Europe, he helped to make the attitudes that define the style, as well as the style itself, widely plausible and attractive. Although classic style does not itself depend upon specifically Cartesian assumptions or conclusions, some of Descartes's characteristic attitudes and emphases are fundamental to the style. Not least among these attitudes is Descartes's conception of his audience's access to truth. In his view, the most important issues in philosophy are of general human concern and can be understood by nonspecialist readers. One expression of this attitude is the very fact that Descartes's most famous book, usually called (misleadingly) in English Discourse on Method (1637), is written in French, not in Latin, the conventional language of advanced study and erudition at the time.

A philosophic treatise called Discourse on Method might lead its reader to expect an abstract discussion about method in general rather than a book about a particular method for doing one thing. Descartes was not, however, interested in discussing method in general, and his original title, while long, was not misleading: DISCOURSE ON THE METHOD of rightly directing one's Reason and of seeking Truth in the Sciences. There is a remarkable and attractive freshness to this book, which in little more than fifty pages of disarming narrative offers a method for separating a few certain truths from the morass of uncertain opinions and simple prejudices that everyone manages unconsciously to acquire. He presents his subject according to the order of reason, represented — not coincidentally, for the supremely rational classic mind — as identical to the order of discovery. Assimilating intellectual experience to the order of reason is a matter of course in classic style.

Descartes's little book is among the most accessible of recognized philosophic classics in the Western tradition. It is not a book by an erudite addressed to other erudites. Descartes explicitly devalues erudition. His thesis is that everybody has what is essential for identifying truth — natural reason — whether or not that person has any special educational formation. Failure to identify truth comes either from directing natural reason to the wrong objects — which can include the recondite lore of erudition — or from uncritically accepting opinion and custom.

Descartes frames his Discourse as a personal account of what he himself did and suggests that anyone who wants to do what he did can. At least ostensibly, he is not arguing a case; he is merely trying to place the reader where he himself stood in order to make his subsequent actions intelligible. His method of expression mirrors his contention that once we clear away received opinion, custom, and prejudice, what is certainly true is immediately apparent because of its distinctness and clarity. Everyone who has cleared away the normal mental impediments is equally capable of perceiving what is certainly true and can personally stand behind his perception. What is certainly true can be personally verified by each individual — whether that individual has mastered Latin and the liberal arts or speaks only low Breton and has spent his life farming — and without the need of any outside authority.

From one point of view, classic style can been seen as a version of Descartes's approach to truth in which the domain of truth has been expanded to include, first, conventional information, and then those very opinions and customs that Descartes filtered out. For Descartes, there are very few certain truths, but everybody has a natural endowment that, once purified, gives access to them. Classic style treats all its objects as if they were equally available to every observer and as if every reader has whatever may be necessary to verify what the writer presents. What is a natural endowment in Descartes becomes a kind of cultural competence in classic style. The certain truths Descartes perceived are internal and essentially timeless. To verify them we need to return to a sort of state of nature as it was before we had acquired any local conventions. Classic style treats external objects, contingent facts, and even opinions as if they too are beyond doubt or discussion. To verify them we need to acquire local conventions so widespread within the relevant culture that the style treats them as if they were natural endowments.

To see how this attitude about verification applies in practice, suppose someone wants to know the color of a house two blocks away. The competence needed to check and report back is so widespread that we might think it pedantic to object to the claim that「anyone」could do it. Let us leave to the fine print all the qualifications: anyone old enough to know his colors, anyone with normal vision, anyone we can trust not to lie, anyone with a normal memory, anyone who will not just wander off after he has checked the house, and so on. If the information needed includes the street address, the pool of people competent to check it is slightly smaller, but as in the case of checking the color, it seems to be possible to ascertain the address with certainty, and again, anyone who knows a simple convention can just look at the numbers attached to the house and report back. Almost anyone whose eyes are pointed in the right direction can certainly get it right. Let us consider a few other bits of information that can be treated as routine to the point of being universally accessible and certain even though each one actually requires a slightly more specific competence based on a human convention that must be learned. Finding a bibliographic citation is like checking a special kind of address: anyone who knows how to use a library and knows the conventional form of a bibliographic entry can just look it up. Finding the citation for a painting in a museum is slightly more specialized, but like the previous examples, it is something that anyone who knows a few simple conventions can certainly look up and get straight. None of these tasks involves argument or reasoning, although they each require something more than a universally shared natural endowment. It seems plausible that the correct color, the correct address, the correct bibliographic citation, the correct catalogue number for a painting can certainly be known by just about anyone in a particular culture over the age of about ten who happens to be standing in the right place.

It is common enough to simplify matters and treat these bits of knowledge as if they were certainties equally accessible to anyone. Classic style expands the domain of truth to include anything that might require not merely the knowledge of a convention but even the ability to make a judgment.

In classic style, opinions stated clearly and distinctly are treated as if they can be verified by simple observation. The writer does not typically attempt to persuade by argument. The writer merely puts the reader in a position to see whatever is being presented and suggests that the reader will be able to verify it because the style treats whatever conventions or even prejudices it operates from as if these were, like natural reason, shared by everyone. It is a style of disguised assertion. A. J. Liebling writes,「The prize fighter is as reluctant as the next artist to recognize his disintegration.」What is at stake here includes the claim that boxing is an art. The point is not argued or even asserted. It is referred to as if it were a fact that the reader, because she shares the competence that Liebling himself has, will recognize as true once it is presented. And that competence itself, Liebling implies, is a convention. The list of the arts, as we all know, includes music, painting, ballet, boxing.

If a writer in this style wants her readers to think that a certain restaurant has a great cellar, a certain book is beautifully written, or a certain time and place attained the summits of civilization, these complex matters of judgment, open to endless qualification and debate, are presented as if they were as obvious as the Library of Congress call number for the first edition of War and Peace in the Maude translation, and as easy to check as that number is for somebody who happens to be in the Library of Congress. The classic writer prototypically neither argues nor asserts what is true because it is part of the definition of the style that anybody in a position to see truth can recognize it for herself.

Truth Can Be Known

There is probably nothing more fundamental to the attitude that defines classic style than the enabling convention that truth can be known. People tend to deceive themselves; they want to make exceptions for reasons of sentimentality or friendship, vanity or interest. They want to avoid knowing truth when truth is painful, to distort truth when truth is inconvenient. But there is no doubt, in the classic attitude, that truth can be known. Knowing truth is as much a part of the equipment of a classic writer as knowing how to play the violin is part of the equipment of a concert violinist. Is it possible to play the violin? can that question occur to a concert violinist? Could there be such a thing as a concert violinist if it were not possible to play the violin? Could there be such a thing as a classic writer if it were not possible to know truth?

Truth Is Not Contingent

The concept of truth that grounds classic style does not depend on what might be called「point of view」or「angle of vision.」The truth of things can be perceived by attentive people of any age or condition. Human experience reveals the same conflicts, the same needs and desires, the same weaknesses and virtues. To pay close attention to personal experience is to see through it to truths that run through all such experience.

Thucydides, writing in Greece in the fifth century B.C., assumes that anything true he says about human conflicts and human institutions in The Peloponnesian War will be verified by the sense of recognition he will elicit from readers who will live through other wars in other times or other places because what is thoroughly local is thoroughly universal, if properly perceived. As Thucydides himself puts it, he seeks「an exact knowledge of the past as an aid to the interpretation of the future, which in the course of human things must resemble if it does not reflect it.」

An experience that is uniquely personal and must therefore be accepted on faith is not a suitable subject for classic style. The reader cannot verify it from his own experience and cannot even check it against earlier testimonies of experience, such as Thucydides'. In the classic view, what cannot be universally verified cannot be true.

The classic attitude is thus both foundationalist and universalist — local events, properly observed, will always disclose universal truths as their foundations. This is an enabling convention. Just as the enabling convention「truth can be known」contradicts the view of the radical skeptic, so the enabling convention「truth is eternal」contradicts the views of the romantic, the relativist, and the ironist for whom truth is contingent. Classic style assumes that truths exist prior to an individual's experience but that knowledge of what is true is achieved through individual experience. Universal truths are eternal and will always be verified by normal experience. They are eternal in two senses: they are discovered, not created, and future experience will always corroborate past testimony. An individual discovers hypocrisy through his experience, but hypocrisy well observed and well described in one time and place will be recognized across cultures and across centuries, since to observe well and describe well in classic style is always to transcend contingent situations. Circumstances change; truth abides.

Truth Is Pure

Truth, in the classic attitude, is a standard for measuring human virtue. As such, it demonstrates an eternal human deficiency, since human virtue exists only in particular human actions, and human actions inevitably involve complex motives, contradictory emotions, and distracting sensations. These things are murky and fluid; they induce moral vertigo in all normal people. The resulting confusion can be temporarily and unsatisfactorily stabilized by deception, irony, and pretense. It can never be escaped.

Truth, on the other hand, has no feelings, no emotions, no motives. It exists always without seeking for anything. It is complete in a way that no person ever is. People feel their inadequacies and desires; they have ambitions. Their hungers cannot be permanently satisfied, merely temporarily assuaged. Truth, eternal and immutable, always remains available to the disciplined writer as a model and a standard, but classic prose is a refinement of human experience. It is what can be known; it is not what can be lived.

Alone with a piece of paper, a writer can submit to the discipline of classic style, prune away ambition and pretense, and achieve the clarity and suppleness that truth confers. But such moments are temporary accomplishments, not permanent possessions.

The classic attitude, especially in its origins, acknowledges human inadequacies: we are victims of our ambitions; fully accurate self-knowledge is unavailable; self-interest leads to self-deception; we are inconsistent, unreliable, impure. Yet the classic attitude is never despairing: these inadequacies are like an unfortunate layer of corruption over a fundamental soundness. We are not impotent, merely weak, and we can grow stronger. We recognize truth when we see it, even though the encounter with truth is brief and difficult to sustain. In the classic view, we can not only aspire to what is fundamentally true and valuable, we can even — and at the key moments — succeed in these aspirations. In Descartes, in parts of Pascal, and in certain American traditions influenced by classic style, encouragement constitutes the principal tone. For La Rochefoucauld, the classic attitude is a consolation for our failures. For Jefferson, it is rather more like the means to success.

The Motive Is Truth

The classic writer is licensed, so to speak, by the truth of what he says, not by his social position, political power, or technical knowledge. Classic writing is animated by a common motive, regardless of its local subject or local purpose

In classic style, the reader and writer are brought together by a common recognition of truth. The writer is never merely indulging personal interests. As a result, a complementary relationship is created between writer and reader: the writer presents truth, and the reader recognizes it. Of course, the classic writer may in fact serve personal interests through his writing, but the attitude adopted in classic prose is that the writer's governing motive is to present truth. To the extent that a work of classic prose has obvious practical purposes, the classic attitude takes the position that they are merely accidental.

One consequence of this attitude for classic prose is that the aphoristic quality of classic prose concerns observation (「No one is ever so happy or unhappy as he thinks」), not morality (「Those who live in glass houses should not throw stones」), or behavior (「Look before you leap」), although it tacitly conveys its expectations about both. The classic writer presents himself not as a guide to morals or behavior, but as an observer of truth.

Even when the classic writer's motive is persuasion, he is reluctant to admit it overtly, and even when he admits it, he does so conditionally, noting that persuasion can never take priority over the abiding motive of presenting truth. Local or practical motives are always constrained to respect this governing motive.

The classic writer presents truth, and typically takes the position that of course the reader will recognize truth. The classic writer rarely writes as if he is pressing claims and presenting arguments, but rather pretends that he is presenting subjects and conducting analyses. When, on rare occasions, the classic writer adopts the stance that the reader will not believe what is being presented, he never concedes that the reader's disposition should influence what he says. A writer who wishes to persuade is constrained from ever telling the audience something it is unwilling to believe, and this is a compromise unacceptable in the classic attitude. The classic attitude compels writers, in extreme cases, to express truth and leave the audience to its folly. In that case — as always — the writer's explicit motive is not hope of persuasion but rather respect for truth. It is the choice Socrates makes in the Apology.

1.4.1 真相

勒内·笛卡儿以一本法语哲学著作助推了十七世纪古典风格的发展。因为他思考的基本问题及为此提供的解决办法吸引了全欧洲的关注，他使这种决定风格的态度及这种风格本身广泛流传。虽然笛卡儿的假设或结论不是古典风格的直接依据，但笛卡儿的一些标志性态度和侧重点是古典风格的基础。最主要的一条是笛卡儿认为读者有权知道真相。在他看来，哲学上最重要的问题都是人类普遍关注的问题，非专业读者也能理解。这种态度可以从笛卡儿最著名的书使用的语言看出来，这本书通常被误称作《谈谈方法》（1637），书写语言是法语，而不是做高深学问常用的拉丁语。

一本名为《谈谈方法》的哲学论著，也许会让读者以为这本书是对一般方法的抽象讨论，而不是某种具体的做事方法。然而，笛卡儿对探讨一般性方法不感兴趣，他原来的书名尽管长，但不至于让人误解：《谈谈正确运用自己的理性在各门学问里寻求真理的方法》。这本小书新颖别致，在五十多页的篇幅里指出了每个人无意中都会陷进去的思想泥潭 —— 模糊观点和简单偏见，并告诉读者如何把它们和少数已确定的真相区分开来。他阐述主题遵照的是推理顺序，与发现顺序完全一样。对笛卡儿这种十分理性的古典思维来说，这不是巧合。他将思想活动按照推理顺序展开，这在古典风格中很常见。

历数西方传统的哲学经典名著，笛卡儿这本小书属于最通俗易懂的。它不是一本学究写给学究看的书。笛卡儿明确反对把学问做得深奥难懂。他认为每个人都有识别真相的必要能力 —— 推理本能 —— 无论他是否具备特殊教育背景。如果识别不出真相，要么是推理本能用错了对象，如晦涩难懂的学问，要么是对观点和习惯不加批判地全盘照收。

笛卡儿认为《谈谈方法》这本书描述的是他个人的亲身经历，还暗示他做过的这些事情任谁想做就都能做到。至少表面上，他没去争辩什么；他只是试着把读者放到他自己所在的位置，方便读者理解他接下来要做什么。他的表达方式传达了他的主张：只要我们消除成见、习惯及偏见，真相的明显和清晰的特点会使它立即显露出来。只要消除常规的思想障碍，每个人都能看到明显的真相，而且可以亲自佐证自己的观察。每个个体都能自已验证真相 —— 无论这个人学过拉丁语和历史文学，还是一辈子从事农耕只会说低等的布列塔尼语 —— 而且不用依赖任何外界权威。

从某种角度看，古典风格可以看作笛卡儿真相观的扩充，其中既有传统信息，也有那些被笛卡儿摒弃的观点和习惯。笛卡儿认为，确定的真相少之又少，但每个人都有一种本能：一旦净化思想，就能看清真相。古典风格无论谈论什么，好像每个观察者都能看到，好像每位读者都具备必要的能力验证作者所述。笛卡儿所说的本能，在古典风格中是一种文化能力。笛卡儿观察到的是一种内在的、永恒的真相。要验证它们，我们需要回到某种自然状态，这种状态就好像我们从未习得过任何某时某地的规约。古典风格把外在事物、有条件的事实甚至观点都当作确凿无疑的东西。要验证它们，我们需要学习某时某地的规约，这些规约根植于所在的文化，在古典风格看来相当于与生俱来的本能。

要看这种验证态度如何运用到现实中，可以假设某人想知道两个街区以外的一幢房子是什么颜色。查看并反映情况是一种普遍的能力，如果咬文嚼字反对「任何人」能做到就有点迂腐了。我们可以附注一列「任何人」的条件：年龄大到可以认识颜色，视力正常，绝不说谎，有正常记忆力，看完房子后不会到处闲逛，等等。如果还要确认房子所在的街道地址，在这个能力范围内的人就少了些。能确认颜色，似乎也就能肯定地确认地址，同样，任何人只要知道一条简单的规约，也能确认房子上挂的门牌号并反映这个情况。任何人只要看的方向没问题，几乎都不会错。让我们看看一些别的信息，这些信息可以看作那种人人都能获取和确认的普通信息，虽然每条信息实际上都要求学会某条人类规约以掌握更具特点的能力。查找文献引文就像确认一种特殊地址：只要知道怎么运用图书馆功能，知道文献条目的常规形式，任何人都能查到。在一座博物馆找到一幅画的出处是更专业一点的任务，但和前面的例子一样，任何人只要知道一些简单规约，肯定能查并能查到。这些任务没有什么需要争辩或理论的地方，虽然要求的能力超出人普遍具有的原始本能，可以说，十岁以上的任何人，只要知道特定文化背景，所在的地方也适当，都能获取正确的颜色、正确的地址、正确的文献引文、正确的画作条目编号。

简化事物，把各种知识当作任何人都能获取的确切之物，这很常见。古典风格把真相的范围从规约性知识扩至形成观点的能力。

在古典风格中，清晰明确的观点被当作经简单观察即可验证的确切事物。作者通常不会用论证来说服读者。作者只是把读者放在某个位置上，让他们去看所呈现的内容，并暗示读者可以验证它，因为古典风格把它依据的任何规约甚至偏见当作推理本能一样的东西，人所共享。它是一种不易察觉的断言。李伯龄（A. J. Liebling）写道：「优秀的拳击手像任何一位艺术家一样，不愿意承认自己大不如前。」（The prize fighter is as reluctant as the next artist to recognize his disintegration）4 这句话的关键信息包括「拳击是一门艺术」这个论点。这个论点没有论证，甚至也没有断言。作者提及这点就好像它是一个事实，只要说出来，读者就知道是真的，因为读者也有李伯龄那样的能力。这种能力本身，从李伯龄的暗示可以看出，是一种规约。正如我们都知道的，艺术名单有音乐、绘画、芭蕾和拳击。

一位古典风格作者如果想向读者表达某家餐厅有一个很棒的地窖，某本书写得很精彩，某时某处达到了人类文明巅峰，经他的呈现，这些容易帮致设完没了的解释和争论的复杂观点，就跟去关国国会图书馆状《战争与和平》第一版莫德英译本的素取号一样显而易见，就好像让一位刚好在美国国会图书馆的人找这本书的索取号一样轻而易举。古典风格作者通常不去论证，也不去断言什么是真相，因为在古典风格的定义中，任何人处于观察真相的位置都能自己认出真相。

真相是可知的

对定义古典风格的态度，最重要的莫不如「真相是可知的」这条基础规约。人容易自我欺骗；因为感伤或友情、虚荣或利益，他们想获得特别待遇。真相带来痛苦时，他们想屏蔽真相，真相带来麻烦时，他们想歪曲真相。在古典风格的态度中，真相是可知的这点毋庸置疑。知道真相是古典风格作者的必备能力之一，就像知道如何演奏小提琴是音乐会小提琴手的必备能力之一。小提琴能用来演奏乐曲吗？这问题是否会发生在一名音乐会小提琴手身上？如果小提琴不能演奏，会有音乐会小提琴手吗？如果真相不可知，会有古典风格作者吗？

真相不是偶然的

古典风格的真相观不是某种被称为「视点」或「视角」的东西。无论处于什么年龄和状态，一个人只要细致观察，就能看到事物的真相。人类经验揭示的是同样的冲突，同样的需求和欲望，同样的缺点和优点。仔细观察个体经验，有助于认识贯穿所有这类经验的真相。

公元前五世纪的希腊作家修昔底德（Thucydides），在《伯罗奔尼撒战争史》（History of the Peloponnesian War）中说到人类冲突和人类制度，他认为凡是他说对了的，都能在读者那里找到认同和验证。尽答这些读者经历的战争不同，所在的时代和地区也不同，只要用正确的方式观察，某时某地的个别情况可以代表普遍情况。正如修昔底德自己所言，他希望「正确认识过去以帮助解释未来，两者在人类事物的进程中如不能相互映照，也必定相似」。5

纯属个人的经验只能照单全收，不适合用作古典风格的主题。读者无法用自己的经验进行验证，甚至无法根据前人的事例（如修昔底德的经验）加以核实。对古典风格来说，不能被广泛验证的不可能是真相。

因此，古典风格的态度既是基础主义也是普遍主义一个别事件，只要正确地观察，总能揭示出作为共同基础的普遍真相。这是一条基础规约。「真相可知」与激进怀疑论者的观点对立，同样，「真相永恒」这条基础规约与浪漫主义者、相对主义者和反讽者的观点对立，因为后者认为真相是偶然的。古典风格认为，真相先于个体经验而存在，但只能通过个体经验认识真相。普遍的真相是永恒的，而且总能被普通经验验证。这里的真相永恒有两重含义：真相只能发现不能被创造；未来的经验总会证实过去的事实。个体通过自身经验发现的虚伪，只要根据此时此地的情况准确地观察和描述，即使跨越不同文化不同世纪也能传达出来，因为准确观察和准确描述超越了偶然情境。时移世易，真相常驻。

真相是纯粹的

在古典风格的态度中，真相是一把衡量人类美德的标尺。它本身展示的是一种永恒的人类缺陷，因为人类美德只存在于特定的人类行为中，而人类行为总会涉及复杂的动机、矛盾的情绪和困惑的感受。这些东西混沌不明、变幻不定，会引发所有普通人道德上的犹疑。这种困惑可以通过一时的欺骗、讽刺或伪装勉强安抚，但永远无法逃避。

但另一方面，真相无关感觉、情绪和动机。它存在不是为了谋求什么。它这种完美无人可及。人们知道自己的缺陷和欲望，他们又怀有野心。满足人们的渴望无法一劳永逸，只能暂时安抚。真相永恒不变，总能被训练有素的作者获取，成为一种模范、一种标准，但古典文章是对人类经验去其糟粕取其精华的结果。真相可以被知道，但无法成为一种生活方式。

只要动手写，作者就会信守古典风格的戒律，撒下野心和伪装，做到真相赋予的清晰和灵活。但这只维持得了一时，无法永久拥有。

古典风格的态度，尤其在发展之初，承认人类的缺陷：我们是自己的野心的受害者；自我认识不可能完全正确；寻求自身利益的结果是自我欺骗；不能始终如一、不可靠、不纯洁是我们的本性。但是，古典风格的态度从无绝望：这些缺陷只是腐坏其外，内核仍坚实完好。我们并非无能，只是羸弱，而且我们可以变得更强大。只要看到真相，我们就能认出来，尽管与真相只是擦肩而过。在古典风格看来，追求真正有价值的真相不仅是一种希望，甚至可以在必要之时成为现实。笛卡儿的作品、帕斯卡的部分作品，以及一些受古典风格影响的美国传统作品的主基调都是鼓舞。拉罗什福科认为古典风格的态度是对我们自身不足的一种慰藉。杰弗逊认为它更像通向成功的方法。

动机是真相

可以说古典风格作者之所以被认可，不是因为他的社会地位、政治权力或技术知识，而是因为他说的是真相。古典写作可以有各自的主题和目的，但都源于同一个动机。

在古典风格中，对真相的共同认识使读者与作者彼此靠近。作者从不会只想着个人利益。因此作者与读者之间存在一种互补关系：作者呈现真相，读者识别真相。当然，古典风格作者实际上可能会利用写作服务个人利益，但古典文章的态度是，作者的首要动机是呈现真相。即使一篇古典文章有明显的实用目的，古典态度只是将其视为偶然。

因为这种态度，古典文章的格言侧重观察，而非道德或行为，尽管暗含了后面两层期望。比如，古典文章会说「人们总是夸大自己的幸福或不幸」（No one is ever so happy or unhappy as he thinks），但不会说「自身有弱点，勿揭他人短」（Those who live in glass houses should not throw stones）或「三思而后行」（Look before you leap）。古典风格作者的姿态不是道德或行为导师，而是观察真相的人。

就算古典风格作者的动机是说服，他也不愿公开承认，就算他承认了这点，他也是有条件地承认，指出说服永远不会超越呈现真相成为首要动机。个别的或实用的动机总是服从这个首要动机。

古典风格作者呈现真相，通常默认读者当然会认出真相。古典风格作者很少为了推行主张和展开论证而写作，表现出来的只是呈现和分析主题。在某些少数场合，古典风格作者觉得读者不会相信呈现的内容时，他也不会退让到按读者的喜好决定怎么说话。作者为了让读者信服，对读者不愿相信的东西闭口不提，这种妥协不是古典态度。古典态度强制古典风格作者在极端的情况下坚持表达真相，读者信不信是读者自己的事。那样的情况下 —— 自始至终 —— 古典风格作者的动机明显不是为了说服，而是尊重真相。这是苏格拉底在《苏格拉底的申辩》里所做的选择。

#### 1.4.2 Presentation

Prose Is a Window

In the classic attitude, writing serves to present something else: its subject. The subject is conceived of as a「thing」distinct from the writing, something that exists in the world and is independent of any presentation. Clarity is the central virtue of classic prose because the classic writer's defining task is to present something he has previously perceived. Self-evident truths, Madame de Chevreuse's character, the power of well-ordered thoughts, the food of France are conceived as「things」with their proper characteristics, existing「in the world」and completely independent of their presentation. The language of classic prose serves these things and should never draw attention to itself. Naturally, when we read La Rochefoucauld's passage on Madame de Chevreuse, we are looking at words; we cannot look through them to Madame de Chevreuse herself, nor could we possibly know what La Rochefoucauld wants to tell us even if we could see her. Nevertheless, classic style operates on the premise that La Rochefoucauld's experience of Madame de Chevreuse is a「thing」that he wants to present through a medium that will, at its best, be transparent, as if the reader were looking at something through a perfectly clean and undistorting window; the window should not draw attention to itself, and will not unless it is obviously defective in some way.

Classic writers speak with conviction. That conviction, they imply, comes from knowledge or experience of something that exists before the writing and is completely independent of it. Their prose is conceived of as a perfectly efficient instrument: it neither invents nor distorts. It is as if the language they use had no characteristics of its own and therefore could not be considered a「thing.」Classic prose does not ask the reader to observe it as if it too is a thing; it invites the reader to look through it to what it presents. It draws attention to itself only when there is something wrong with it.

Consider Jefferson's phrase「that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.」Jefferson is an accomplished writer, but that is taken for granted and not something he wants his readers even to notice. If someone read the Declaration of Independence in 1776 and found the writing itself to be the most memorable thing about it, there would be something wrong with it.

Contrast Jefferson's style with that of Jeremy Bentham on the fallacy of begging the question:

Having, without the form, the force of an assumption — and having for its object, and but too commonly for its effect, a like assumption on the part of the hearer or reader, — the sort of allegation in question, how ill-grounded soever, is, when thus masked, apt to be more persuasive than when expressed simply and in its own proper form: especially where, to the character of a censorial adding the quality and tendency of an impassioned allegation, it tends to propagate, as it were by contagion, the passion by which it was suggested.

Bentham is talking about a fallacy here; he has no reason to want to place his own writing in the foreground, but whatever he may be saying about begging the question, what is likely to make the strongest impression on anybody who reads him is his manner of presentation. It is as if we expect to find a window and encounter a fun-house mirror. Bentham's sentence can be puzzled out. We can determine what he means to say. We could rewrite it in classic style. But classic prose never has to be puzzled out. We never have to rework the expression in order to see what it means to present.

Classic Prose Is Perfect Performance

When a jazz master improvises, perhaps the most impressive aspect of the performance is its appearance of impromptu perfection. Although improvised, the performance has no mistake, false step, or deficiency. It looks inevitable, as if it could have been done in no other way, as if every stage were known to the performer from the beginning.

Paradoxically, we know that if the same jazz master performed the improvisation again, it would be entirely different, but it would still appear as if it could have been done in no other way, as if it were inevitable.

This same characterization might apply to a knock-out sequence in a boxing match, a lethal volley at Wimbledon, a winning stretch move in a horse race, or an ingenious screen pass in football. It is perfect, and we confront a paradox. We know that the performance is not just a rare example of everything going right, because the masters of these arts can give similar performances repeatedly. The performance therefore had to be prepared, because no performance can be routinely perfect without preparation. Yet it is difficult to imagine just what such preparation might have been. The performances are not canned. They are fresh and spontaneous even though we know that they are the result of practice and effort. The basketball player who sinks the ball amid a chaotic field of play without looking at the basket can do that because she has memorized a certain spot on the floor to the point where she no longer even needs to see the basket to hit it. But the preparation is hidden, and the performance looks like magic.

Classic style is perfect performance, with no hesitation, revision, or backtracking. Its essential fiction is that this perfection happens at the first try. Classic style does not acknowledge process or stages of discovery, does not acknowledge revision or successive refinements. The performance suggests that to write this way, one can never hesitate, grope, or struggle, whether in thought or in language. This is part of the performance, and when it succeeds it does not seem to be a performance at all. Its corollary fiction is that the performance cannot be prepared because it has no parts that could be worked on separately or in stages. It is seamless. The writer appears simply to have been born with an ability that the rest of us lack. To someone attempting to learn classic style, these fictions can be intimidating. In learning this style, it is helpful to remember that these are fictions.

Because classic style presents fully refined thought in inevitable prose, it is final. This finality excludes two kinds of hedges, which we will call hedges of process and hedges of liability. Hedges of process are hesitations and uncertainties that arise because one is in the middle of thought. For example, one may say something, then think better of it, and then add a disclaimer or a qualifier. But in the model of classic prose, the thought is final, so hedges of process are rare.

Hedges of liability are insurance against the possibility of having overlooked something or being ignorant of something that would change the writer's views or conclusions. For example, a writer may say that in her limited experience, such and such is true. This hedges the writer against contradiction by experience she has not had. But in the model of classic prose, the thought is fully refined, so hedges of liability are rare. The classic writer does not say,「As far as I know, there was never a more gallant court than that of Henri II,」but rather,「There was never a more gallant court than that of Henri II.」

There is a third sort of hedge that classic prose omits, which we will call hedges of worth. The classic writer spends no time justifying her project. The classic writer does not compare its worth to the worth of other projects. A classic writer will write about milk, for example, with no indication that there can be a question about the worth of writing about milk, no indication that the reader could entertain any doubt about the worth of writing about milk. A classic writer might begin an essay on milk with the claim,「In spite of its liquid state, milk must always be considered as a food and not as a beverage.」A classic writer might begin an essay on a little-known species of bird with the observation,「Unusual among songbirds, shrikes prey on small birds and rodents, catching them with the bill and sometimes impaling them on thorns or barbed wire for storage.」Classic writers do not distract readers with questions of the worth of the project. There is no hierarchy of importance of subjects in classic writing. Everything is in close focus.

Every Word Counts

It is possible to skim certain styles. Most after-dinner speeches are presented in styles that claim only part of our attention. Many textbooks and news articles are written in styles that allow us to bounce over words and phrases and still feel that we have extracted the sense accurately.

Browsing is different from skimming. In browsing, we look from thing to thing, deciding what to choose. Classic style allows browsing but not skimming. We may turn to just one paragraph, say, in an essay, or even to one sentence, and focus on just that. But once we focus on a unit in classic style, and intend to understand it, then we must pay attention to every detail. Writer and reader assume that every word counts. If the reader skips a single word or phrase or sentence, the sense of the unit may be lost. Classic style contains crucial nuances, which can be lost in skimming.

Clarity Everywhere Is Not Accuracy Everywhere

Fine, accurate distinctions and subtle nuance are among the most typical features of classic style. But classic style has a clear hierarchy of goals; what is subordinate to the main issue can never be allowed to obscure that issue or distract attention from it. When accuracy in the sense of being exhaustively correct involves complicated qualifications of no consequence to the main issue, classic writers do not hesitate to simplify. In this frame, accuracy becomes pedantry if it is indulged for its own sake. A classic writer will phrase a subordinate point precisely but without the promise that it is technically accurate. The convention between writer and reader is that the writer is not to be challenged on these points because they are merely scaffolding.

Waverley Root begins The Food of France,「As far back as the records go, the people of the land now known of as France have thought of food in terms of its taste more often than in terms of its nutritive qualities.」Root wants to indicate that the culinary traditions he treats are immemorial, but the actual documentary history or demographic realities of France are not at issue. It would be silly to question whether Vercingetorix the Gaul really thought about food more often in terms of taste or nutritive qualities. The subordinate point is stated with care and precision, but without a tortured accuracy that would bury the essential distinction between nutrition and taste under a ton of scholarly documentation.

1.4.2 呈现

文章即窗户

在古典风格的态度中，写作是为了呈现写作之外的东西：它的主题。主题被看作一种不同于写作的「事物」，在这个世上实实在在地存在，与用什么方式呈现无关。古典文章的主要特点是清晰，因为古典风格作者的首要任务是呈现先前已观察过的事物。不言自明的真相、谢弗勒兹夫人的个性、条分缕晰的力量、法国美食，都被看作「事物」，有着各自专有的特征，「在世上」存在，完全独立于它们的呈现方式。古典文章的语言服务于这些事物，但不应让人过分关注语言本身。当我们阅读拉罗什福科描述谢弗勒兹夫人的段落时，我们看的自然是文字；我们不可能通过文字看到谢弗勒兹夫人本人，即使我们能见到她，我们也不可能知道拉罗什福科想告诉我们什么。不过古典风格依据的前提是拉罗什福科限中的谢弗勒兹夫人是一种「事物」，他用来呈现的媒介最好是透明的，就像一面极其干净又不会失真的窗户：这扇窗本身不该引人注目，也不会这样，除非某方面的问题太明显。

古典风格作者说话语气坚定。这种坚定源自对事物的认识和体验在写作之前就已发生且完全独立于写作。他们的文章被当作一种十分高效的媒介：不编造也不歪曲。好像他们用的语言没有自己的特征，算不上一件「事物」。古典文章不会让读者把文章本身也看成一件事物；它让读者通过它看到它呈现的东西。只有文章有问题时，文章本身才会引人注目。

看看杰弗逊的这句话「人人生而平等；人人都享有上帝赋予的某些不可转让的权利，其中包括生命权、自由权和追求幸福的权利。」① 杰弗逊是一位杰出的作者，但这是理所当然的事情，他都没想到让读者关注这点。假如有谁读了 1776 年的《独立宣言》，记得最深刻的是文章本身，那文章可能就有问题。

① 汉译文出自（世界各国法律大典美国法典（宪法行政法卷）》吴新平翻泽版本，本书其他《独立宣言》选段均出自该版本。—— 译者注

比较一下杰弗逊的风格与杰里米·边沁（Jeremy Bentham）论述「循环论证自证谬论」的风格：

选段 2-1

它有（虽无假设的形式）假设的力量 —— 以及（就目标及过于普遍的效果而言）在听者或读者心中构建的类似假设这类未经证实的断言，无论多么站不住脚，经过这般粉饰之后，往往比用一种简单、适合它的方式表达更有说服力：尤其是赋予假定的判断不容置疑的激昂论调后，它往往会大肆宣扬它所暗示的激昂，如传染一般。6

边沁在这里讲的是一种谬误，没理由突显自己的写作，但不管他谈到循环论证哪些方面，任何人读完后印象最深刻的可能都是他的呈现方式。这就像我们本来想找一扇窗户，却遇到了一面哈哈镜。边沁的句子多琢磨几遍也能懂。我们可以判断他要说什么。我们可以用古典风格改写它。但古典文章从来都不需要过多琢磨。我们从来不用改写之后才清楚它想呈现什么。

完美表演

当一位爵士大师即兴表演时，也许最让人惊叹的是，表演看起来即兴又完美。虽然即兴而作，但表演没有失误，没有出错的舞步，没有瑕疵。看起来非此不可，好像用别的任何方式都不行，好像一开始表演者就对每一段都了然于心。

相悖的是，我们知道，如果让同一位爵士乐大师还原前面的即兴表高，将是完全不同的表演，但看起来好像仍然没有更好的方式，非此不可。

我们可以用上面同样的方式描述拳击比赛的一次击倒绝杀，温布尔登网球此赛的一记致命截击，赛马比赛冲喇终点的制胜一跃，或者美式足球比赛的一次掩护短传。这都很完美，而我们面对的是一个悖论。我们知道，表演不出现任何失误的情况并不少见，因为精通这些艺术的人可以重复类似表演。因此表演要预先做好准备，因为没有准备的表演不可能总是完美的。不过这种准备该是什么样，很难想象得到。表演不是预先录制好的。它们是临场发挥的即兴表演，虽然我们知道它们是长期训练和努力的结果。篮球运动员在混乱的赛场上投篮，不看篮筐就能投进，因为他已经对球场上的某个位置熟稔于心。但是，赛前准备是私下进行的，表演看起来就像魔术一样。

古典风格是完美的表演，不会有犹豫、修正或回溯。这种一次就成功的完美虽是假象，但必不可少。古典风格不承认发现的过程和步骤，不承认需要修正和反复推敲。这种表演暗示，按照这种方式写作，无论思想还是语言，都绝不能犹豫、摸寻或挣扎。这也是表演的一部分，做到这点后，就看不出一点表演痕迹。这自然产生一种假象，这种表演无法事先准备，因为它不能分成不同部分，单独或分步练习，它浑然天成。作者看上去生来就有一种我们其他人没有的天赋。对想试着学习古夹风格的人来说，这些假象让人望而生畏。记住这些只是假象，会有助于学习古典风格。

因为古典风格用非此不可的语言呈现充分斟酌的思想，所以它是终局性表达。这种终局排除了两种防范态度，我们称为过程防范和责任防范。过程防范源自边写边思考的犹豫与不确定。比如，一个人可能说了什么，又想到更好的表达，就又加了个免责声明或限定条件。但按古典文章的模式，思想是终局性思考，所以很少出现过程防范。

责任防范是用来防止疏忽或者漏掉什么的，以免影响作者的观点或结论的正确性。比如，作者可能会说就他有限的经验来看，什么跟什么是正确的。这就避免了作者因经验不足而导致观点有误。但是按照古典风格的模式，思想是充分斟酌过的，所以很少出现责任防范。古典风格作者不会说：「据我所知，没有哪个时期的宫廷比亨利二世时期的宫廷更勇猛的了」，但他会说，「没有哪个宫廷比亨利二世时期的宫廷更勇猛的了」。

还有第三种防范是古典风格拒绝的，我们称为价值防范。古典风格作者不会花时间讨论这个主题值不值得写。古典风格作者不会把该主题的价值与其他主题的价值相提并论。比如，古典风格作者要写与牛奶相关的主题，就不会怀疑牛奶是否值得写，也不会担心读者会怀疑牛奶值不值得写。古典风格作者可能在文章开头这样描述牛奶：「尽管是液态，牛奶一向被看作食物而不是饮料。」7 古典风格作者介绍一种不常见的鸟，可能从观察开始写，「与大多数鸣禽不同，伯劳鸟捕食小型鸟类和啮齿类动物，用喙捕捉到它们后，有时还把它们穿在荆枝或铁丝网上储存起来」。古典风格作者不会用某个主题是否值得讨论这类问题干扰读者。古典写作的主题没有大小或主次之分。每件事物都值得细细观察。

一字不落

有些风格可以略读。大多数饭后闲谈所用的风格只需要部分注意力。很多教材和时事新闻的写作风格允许跳过某些字词，且不影响正确理解要旨。

浏览不同于略读。浏览时，我们逐条搜寻，决定选择什么信息。古典风格可以浏览但不可以略读。比如，我们看一篇论文，可能看到某个段落，或者甚至某句话，专注在那里。一旦我们专注古典风格的某个单元，要想弄懂它，我们必须关注每个细节。作者和读者假定每个字都很重要。如果读者略过某个字、词或句子，这个单元的语义可能会缺失。

古典风格有很多细微但重要的字词，略读容易漏掉。

处处清晰不是处处较真

古典风格最典型的特征包括细微差异和微妙变化。但古典风格有一个清晰的目标层级，不能因为细枝末节的问题埋没主要问题或抢占注意力。若为了精确，要详尽无遗地列出复杂的限定条件，却无助于表达主要问题，古典风格作者会毫不犹豫地简化。为了精确而精确是迂腐。古典风格作者会准确地表述某个子观点，但不保证严格意义上的精确。作者和读者默守着一条规约：作者不会在这些问题上受到挑战，因为它们只是搭建脚手架的组件。

维瓦利·鲁特（Waverley Root）在《法国美食》（The Food ofFramnce）这本书的开头写道，「早在有书面记载以前，法国这片土地早期的居民想到食物时，想的多是口味而不是营养价值。」9 鲁特想表明，他讲述的烹饪传统自古就有，但法国实际有记载的历史或人口现实不是他要讨论的问题。如果去问高卢人首领维钦托利（Vercingetorix the Gaul）想到食物时想的是味道还是营养，就显得愚蠢了。作者审慎准确地陈述子观点，但不会字字较真，把营养与味道这条主要差异埋没在一堆学术文献中。

#### 1.4.3 Scene

The Model Is One Person Speaking to Another

The idiom of classic style is the voice of conversation. The writer adopts the pose of a speaker of near-perfect efficiency whose sentences are the product of the voice rather than some instrument of writing. Johnson's sentence about Shakespeare is prototypically unclassic because it could never be taken for speech. Classic style models itself on speech and can be read aloud properly the first time.

In speech, an expression is gone the moment it is spoken, and has only that one instant to enter the mind and attain its place in memory. Since classic writing pretends to be speech, it never requires the reader to look forward or backward; it never admits that the reader is in a situation to do so. Each phrase is presented as if it has only one chance — now — to do its job. Of course, a reader may in fact go over a passage of classic prose many times. But the classic writer never acknowledges that possibility either explicitly or by implication.

The ideal speech of classic style appears to be spontaneous and motivated by the need to inform a listener about something. It has just occurred to the speaker to tell someone about this, and so he has begun to do so. Or perhaps he is talking to someone else and is overheard. What he has to say is not a set piece. He has not labored over it beforehand, systematically refining and arranging various thoughts, editing their expression, and then speaking the polished whole aloud. Something occurs to him and he says it. He takes another moment's brief but perfect thought and says the next thing. As a consequence, the rhythm of the writing is a series of movements, each one brief and crisp, with an obvious beginning and end. Of course, in retrospect, we may see that these movements are organized into a flawless global structure, but the pretense is that this global organization is the natural product of the writer's orderly mind. It comes out that way the first time without special effort. The global organization is never referred to; its existence is not even acknowledged. The classic writer thus banishes from his vocabulary phrases like「as we shall see,」「three paragraphs ago,」「before I move to my next point I must introduce a new term,」「the third part of our four-part argument is,」and all other「metadiscourse」that proclaims itself as writing rather than speech.

Pascal's Lettres provinciales are the prototype of this appearance. They are a defense of Jansenism, written in the form of letters from someone in Paris to someone in the provinces. The presentation is informal; the writer is just describing events in the capital. They do not suggest deliberate strategy. It is almost as if the writer had nothing better to do; it occurs to the writer to tell his provincial friend about something everyone in Paris is excited about. It could even be that the writer corresponds with this friend routinely, and that the controversy over Jansenism is merely this season's news. The letters give the appearance of spontaneity: the writer has not sketched out in advance how many letters there will be or what he will write about in each letter. He has not even sketched out the one letter he is writing. The letters do not suggest that they have been edited, either. In this way, classic style has something in common with dramatic performances of talk and conversation. The playwright or screenwriter has edited out everything that is dispensable, but the result is not supposed to sound edited.

The prototypical scene in classic writing is an individual speaking intimately to another individual. What the classic writer has to say is directed entirely to that one individual. But it can be overheard. The reader is sometimes cast in the role of the individual addressed, sometimes cast in the role of eavesdropper. The role of the reader in the Lettres provinciales, for example, is someone who has come across these letters accidentally. These letters imply the participation of their original recipient in a conversation. There is even one short answering letter.

In fact, classic prose is meant to be overheard, because although it is directed entirely toward one individual it never needs to be bent to fit that individual. It is fine if it is overheard, because what it has to say and the way it says it are not contingent upon the audience. It is never dishonorable or problematic. The classic writer does not appear to have written things in a way she would not had she known others were listening.

Classic style is not a style for oratory — in the first place because its model scene is so different from the model scene of oratory. In oratory, the implied author is a rhetor, an actor, adopting a role to speak to an implied audience consisting of a group. The classic writer is not speaking to a group, and although she is of course also an actor, her act is to play at presenting herself. She takes the pose of authenticity. This acting, when good, makes the writer look vulnerable, in the sense that she is exposing what she cares about.

Paradoxically, classic style thus requires a strong revelation of personality even as it subordinates what is merely personal. The classic writer is not interested in mirroring the personal processes of her thought; certainly she is not interested in mirroring her personal sensations or emotions. Yet, since her only motive for speaking is the felt importance of what she has to say, she reveals herself through the topics she chooses and what she says about them.

The model scene of classic prose — an individual speaking to another individual — is not always followed literally from beginning to end. Some texts that appear ostensibly to be based on a different model turn out, on closer inspection, to have been based on the classic model. Let us take as an example the Declaration of Independence. Its beginning and end do not look classic. Its ending is a formulaic speech act, an official declaration of independence with all the appropriate legalistic phrases:

We, therefore, the Representatives of the United States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by the Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown. . . .

Speech acts occur between two people informally and intimately all the time, as in「Can you open the door?,」but formal versions of speech acts, like those in the Declaration or「I hereby promise to pay you the amount owed,」are usually reserved for situations where the public audience serves as a witness that the act has been performed. There are no official witnesses to classic prose and no audience with institutional expectations, such as a theater audience, the audience at an inauguration, or the audience at the opening of a bridge.

The ending of the Declaration of Independence is unclassic in another way: its last sentence is a bit of inflated oratory:

And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.

The beginning of the Declaration of Independence is not classic, either. It announces a scene explicitly removed from the model scene of classic style: it pretends that it is an announcement from a people — the citizens of the colonies — to the whole world:

When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

But between the opening and the closing sections of the Declaration, its voice is the voice of one person talking, observing injuries. You can almost see the expression on the face of the speaker, and see his hand gestures as he speaks these words. The speaker wishes to present something to you: the state of things in the colonies, or more specifically in his own life, and why the colonies and he must go their own way. The language is clear and direct and memorable. It is written so as to be understood the first time it is heard. Here are a few examples:

The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. . . .

He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their Public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures. . . .

He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.

He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.

The Declaration of Independence is not one person speaking to another, but in its body it never gets away from that model. The case is similar for sermons, technical reports, lectures, and business memos: the actual scene is not the model scene of classic style, but the writing can be formed upon the classic scene. In fact, not even the prototypical texts of classic style are literally one individual spontaneously speaking to another.

If classic prose is ideal speech, just between us, spontaneous, it follows that its occasions are informal. On the other hand, Johnson on Shakespeare assumes an imaginary protocol between writer and audience in which the occasion is the formal presentation of the writer's labors. It is something like the Mass, whose observers know that its occasion is formal and planned. The protocol of classic prose, by contrast, is spontaneity. It just occurred to the speaker to say this. The informality of the occasion overlaps with the pose of authenticity.

The sense of informality is truer of seventeenth-century French classic style than of its English or American versions. French classic style was at heart a style for memoirs or private reflections. Other occasions — governmental, military, religious, bureaucratic, political — already had their sophisticated protocols, which classic style could not supplant. To some extent in England and to a far greater extent in the United States in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the styles of sermons, political speeches, and other formal presentations were not so immutably established. Classic style in America consequently had the opportunity to take on a use in formal presentations — such as the Declaration of Independence — that it could not have had in its French version.

We can contrast a political text like the Declaration of Independence — whose model scene though not its actual scene is one individual talking to another — with unclassic political speeches such as the typical State of the Union address to Congress or the typical inaugural speech by a governor. There is always a jolt of passion behind the real classic writer, a little excitement because there is a personal conviction and commitment that is often completely missing from a plain statement of what politicians say when they have no intention of acting on it. In the typical State of the Union address, the president of the United States not only can but must speak pieties clearly inconsistent with his actions. Who believes what he is saying? Who thinks he means anything related to action when he says it? In the course of reading the Lettres provinciales, it is possible to believe Pascal is wrong, but it is not possible to believe he is saying something he does not really believe, something he would not act on himself. The classic speaker of the Declaration of Independence is certainly going to act on what he is saying. In fact, his speech is an action, and he is putting his life and fortune at risk by that action. The classic writer is an individual, not the organ of a bureaucracy, and so he says what he believes rather than what a committee has decided it can live with. Classic writers are independent, not concerned to protect members of a bureaucracy. They are not controlled by policy, interests, or an organization, or at least they give no appearance of being controlled in such a fashion. Rid of this baggage, they have a freshness that no utterance cobbled together by committee can ever have. The typical political speech, such as a State of the Union address, cannot say much because it has so many constituencies to worry about. It cannot be written by any individual. It is always the product of a committee, so when it is said or read by the pope or the president or the secretary of lies, it does not sound like an individual speaking. It sounds like what it is: the rumble of bureaucracy.

The classic writer is an individual; his model audience is an individual. The classic writer, therefore, does not make distinctions between members of the audience, saying, for example, that some of them will be better prepared to understand what he has to say than will others, or that some will be interested in the first part and others in the second part. Of course, since he implicitly claims to be talking without having mapped out the global organization, he usually avoids any reference to parts. He also avoids raising any questions about whether the reader is interested in what he has to present, with the result that usually it does not occur to the reader to doubt his own interest.

Prose Is Efficient but Not Rushed

The efficiency of classic style is really a luxury. There are no pressures upon the classic writer. There is the absolute need to present truth about something, but that need, however strongly felt by the classic writer, is not an imposed need. Nothing external manipulates the classic writer, whose motive is neither gain nor reputation. Neither profit nor fear spurs the classic writer's efforts. Nor is there any internal anxiety or ambition. Certainly the clock has no effect upon the classic writer.

We think of efficiency as a weapon against time or as an instrument of productivity. The efficiency expert's job is conceived of as saving money by saving time. Efficiency in these contexts is a competitive trick.

The efficiency of the classic writer is purely a matter of mind. Efficiency in thought is the companion of grace and accuracy, indeed makes them possible. The efficiency of classic prose is the natural product of the classic writer's focused and orderly mind. The classic writer has the luxury of thinking without distraction or pressure. Nothing has the power to hurry the classic writer. Classic prose is thus free of disclaimers that the writer does not have time to do a proper job, or that abbreviations must be made in the interest of time, or that he must skip over something. Indeed, the classic writer seems almost to dwell over a sentence for the slightest moment after it ends, as if to savor it or allow its full impact, before going on to the next sentence.

Classic Style Is Energetic but Not Anxious

Students of martial arts explain that a muscle tensed before performance performs badly, because the tension interferes with the impulse to move. Classic style gives the impression that all of the writer's considerable energy is communicated directly to the writing, with none lost collaterally to anxiety or apprehension. The end of a particularly classic phrase seems to leave its writer in a state of repose out of which the next absolutely efficient movement will come.

If we think of a relaxed state as one free of needless tension but nonetheless fully attentive, then we can say that classic style is relaxed even as it performs, in the way a champion racehorse or sprinter is relaxed even at greatest speed. Inefficient effort is the mark of a neophyte.

1.4.3 场景

一对一说话

古典风格的精髓在于对话有声。古典风格作者采取的姿态是，他说出的话高效得近乎完美，句子声落即定，而不是边写边琢磨。约翰逊写莎士比亚的句子是典型的非古典风格，因为口头说不出来这样的话。古典风格模仿说话场景，一遍就可以准确地大声说出来。

口头的话刚说出来就消失了，只能在那个瞬间被大脑理解和记忆。因为古典风格把写作当说话，从不要求读者来回读；也从不承认读者需要来回读。它假定每次表达只有一次机会一此刻一才能被读到。当然，事实上读者可能会反复翻阅一篇古典文章。但古典风格作者不会声明，也不会默认这种可能性。

理想的古典风格对话看起来是即兴的，因为需要告诉听者什么事情。说话的人刚好想起来要跟某人说这个，于是就说了起来。或者也许是他和别人正说着话，无意中被听到。他不是酝酿着说。他无须事先费心思，先有章法地提炼和组织各种想法，斟酌好措辞，再一语惊人。一些事情浮入脑海，他就说了出来。很快跳入另一个完美的想法，他接着说出下一句。因此，写作的节奏是一系列动作，每个动作干脆利落，有明显的开始和结束。

当然，事后回想，我们会发现这些动作其实是组织得完美无瑕的完整结构，却假装是作者思想有序的自然结果。一想到就是那样，无须多想。作者不会说出这种完整的构思，甚至也不会承认。因此古典风格作者的用词不会出现「正如我们将看到的」「上面三个段落之前」「讲下一个要点之前，我要先介绍一个新词」「我们四段论的第三部分是」等写作才有而非说话必需的「元话语」。

帕斯卡的《致外省人信札》是典型的「假装说话」。这部作品借助一位巴黎人给外省人写信的方式捍卫詹森主义。这是一种非正式的呈现；作者只是描绘都城里发生的事情，看不出来是精心谋划的。就像作者没有别的更好的事情可以做，刚好想到跟一位外省的朋友讲讲每个巴黎人都喜闻乐见的事情一样。甚至可能是作者经常跟这位朋友通信，这季谈到的新闻恰好是对詹森主义的争论而已。这些信看起来是随兴写的，作者先前也没估算过要写多少封信，每封信写什么内容。就连他现在正在写的信，也没事先想好写什么。也看不出来这些信是编辑过的。这样看，古典风格与戏剧表演中的说话和对话有共通之处。剧作家或者编剧已经删掉所有可有可无的内容，但不会让人发现删减痕迹。

古典写作的典型场景是一个人与另一个人亲密交谈。古典风格作者要说的话完全是说给那一个人听的。但别人可能会无意中听到。读者的角色有时是参与对话的人，有时是偷听者。比如《致外省人信札》的读者角色是无意读到这些信的人。这些信暗示最初的收信人参与了对话。甚至附过一封简短的回信。

事实上，古典文章没有提防着被偷听，因为尽管它只对一个人说，也无须迎合那个人。有人偷听也不要紧，因为无论读者是谁，它讲述的内容和方式都不会变。它没有什么不光彩的或难办的。古典风格作者不会表现出这样的态度：要知道还有别人在听，他就不这么写了。

古典风格不适合用来演说 —— 首先，因为古典风格的典型场景跟演说风格的典型场景差别很大。演说风格默认作者擅长修辞和表演，默认听众对象是一群人。古典风格作者不是跟一群人讲话，虽然他自己当然也是一位演员，但他表演的是呈现自己。他的姿态是事实就是如此。这种表演，若演得好，会让作者看起来处于弱势，因为他在暴露自己关心的东西。

因此古典风格要求坦露自己的个性，但自相矛盾的是，个性纯属个人化的特质。古典风格作者的兴趣不在于表现他个人的思路过程；当然，也不在于表现他个人的感受和情绪。因为他说话的唯一动机是他觉得他要说的话很重要，所以他选择的话题和讲的内容揭露了自己。

① 此处的第三人称代词原为 she，本书多处用表示女性的「she」泛指作者或读者，但也有用表示男性的「he」泛指作者或读者，根据目前的通行程度，汉译文均统一为「他」，泛指作者或读者。—— 译者注

古典文章的典型场景 —— 一个人与另一个人说话 —— 并非总是从头到尾贯穿整篇文章。一些文本表面上看是别的风格，仔细看原来是古典风格。以《独立宣言》为例，它的开头和结尾看不出来是古典风格。它的结构是一种程式化言语行为，用恰当的法律用语发表官方独立宣言：

因此，我们这些在国会集会的美利坚合众国的代表们，吁请世界的最高裁判来判断我们这些意图的正义性。我们以这些殖民地的善良人民的名义并根据他们的授权，庄严地公告和宣布：这些联合殖民地现在是，并且按照法律应该是自由和独立的国家：他们解除了对英国王室的一切效忠…...

两个人的交谈总是非正式的亲密行为，比如「你能开门吗？」，但正式的言语行为，如《独立宣言》中的句子或「我在此承诺向你足额支付欠款」，一般专用于特定的场合，而听众作为见证人见证该行为被执行。古典文章没有官方见证人，也没有带着世俗期望的观众，比如，剧院、就职典礼或大桥落成仪式上的观众。

《独立宣言》的结尾不是古典风格还表现在：它的最后一句话有种演说的高调。

为了拥护本宣言，我们怀着对神圣上帝保佑之坚定信心，谨以我们的生命、财产和神圣的名誉互相发誓。

《独立宣言》的开头也不是古典风格。它表现的场景明显不属于古典风格的典型场景：它假装这是一个民族 —— 殖民地全体公民 —— 向全世界的宣告。

在人类事件的进程中，当一个民族有必要解除一直把它与另一个民族连接起来的政治桎梏，并且在世界列国中确认由自然的法律和自然的上帝的法律所赋予他们的独立平等地位时，对人类公意的真诚尊重要求他们宣布迫使他们独立的理由。

但是在宣言开头与结尾之间的部分，它的声音是一个人观察伤口时说话的声音。你几乎可以看到演讲者脸上的表情，看到他说这些话时做的手势。演讲者希望向你展示一些东西：殖民地事务的现状，或者具体到他个人生活事务的现状，以及为什么殖民地和他个人必须找到各自的发展道路。所用语言清晰、直接、易记，读者听一遍就能懂。比如下面几个例子：

当今大不列颜国王的历史，就是一部怙恶不悛、倒行逆施的历史。他的一切行为的直接目的，就是在我们这些殖民地建立一种绝对的专制统治…...

他把各州的立法团体召集到特别的、不便利的和远离政府档案库的地方去开会，因为其唯一的目的，就是使那些立法机关疲于奔命，以服从他的指使…...

他掠夺我们的海上船舶，骚扰我们的沿海地区，焚毁我们的城市，残害我们人民的生命。

他强迫我们那些在公海被俘的同胞武装起来反对自己的国家，充当屠杀其兄弟和朋友的剑子手，或者死于其兄弟和朋友之手。

《独立宣言》不是一个人与另一个人对话，但它的中间部分从未脱离这种模式。这种场合与布道、技术报告、讲座和商业备忘录的场合类似：实际场景不是古典风格的典型场景，但写作可以构建在古典场景上。事实上，甚至典型的古典风格文本，也不完全是一个人与另一个人的即兴对话。

如果古典文章是理想对话，仅是你和我之间即兴的交流，那么它的场合是非正式的。不同的是，约翰逊写莎士比亚戏剧集序言时，假定作者与读者之间存在一种假想协议：这是正式场合，要呈现作者的苦心弧指。它类似做弥散，它的观察者知道它是精心安排的正式场合。相反，古典文章的协议是即兴。作者想到就说了。这种场合的非正式性与此乃事实的姿态有共通之处。

相比英美的古典风格，这种非正式感在十七世纪法国的古典风格中尤为明显。法国古典风格本质上是一种回忆录或个人回忆的风格。别的一些场合，比如政府、军事、宗教、官僚、政治上的场合，已经有各自成熟的协议，非古典风格能取代。某种程度上对十七、十八世纪的英国来说，尤其是对美国，布道、政治讲话及其他正式陈述的风格还未建立不可撼动的地位。因此在美国，古典风格有机会用于正式发言 —— 比如《独立宣言》—— 但在法国不可能出现类似的古典风格宣言。

我们可以比较古典风格与非古典风格的政治文本，前者以《独立宣言》为例，典型场景（虽不是实际场景）是一个人与另一个人的对话，后者以典型的国会国情咨文讲话或典型的州长就职演讲为例。真正的古典风格作者总是藏着一股激情，透露些许兴奋，因为他们怀着个人的信念和承诺，这些情感在光说不做的政治家那里是缺失的。在典型的国情咨文演讲中，美国总统会说一些明显言行不一的大话，而且是必须要说的。谁相信他说的话？谁认为他会有心践行他说的话？读《致外省人信札》的过程中，你可能认为帕斯卡错了，但不会认为他说的话，是他自己都无法相信也无法践行的。

《独立宣言》的古典风格发言人当然会践行他自己说的话。事实上，他的演讲就是一种行动，这种行动将他的生命和命运置于危险之中。古典风格作者代表的是个人，而不是官僚机构，所以他说的是自己相信的，而不是委员会一致决定折中的事情。古典风格作者是独立的个人，不必担心要保护官僚机构的人。他们不会受政策、利益或组织的摆布，或者至少不会表现出受了某种方式摆布。因为不用背负这种压力，所以他们说话有一种即兴的热情，委员会东拼西凑的发言不可能有这样的热情。典型的政治演讲，比如国情咨文演讲，不能讲太多，因为要照顾到不同选区。任何个人写不出来这样的文章。它总是某个委员会共同权衡出来的结果，所以当教皇或总统或满口谎言的秘书说或读的时候，听起来不像个体发言，而像它本来的样子 —— 官僚机构的低声议论。

古典风格作者是独立的个体；他的典型读者也是独立的个体。所以古典风格作者不会划分不同的读者，比如有些读者比别人更愿意理解他说的话，或者一些读者对第一部分感兴趣，另一些读者对第二部分更感兴趣。当然，因为他默认的主张是，说话不会提前酝酿完整的结构，所以一般他不提某些单独的部分。他也不会问读者是否对他说的话感兴趣，通常读者也没想到自己是否感兴趣。

高效但不仓促

古典风格的效率确实是一种奢侈。古典风格作者没有压力。毋庸置疑，呈现事情真相是一种绝对的必要，但无论古典风格作者觉得多么急迫，这都不会是一种强制要求。没有什么外在的东西可以操控古典风格作者，他的动机非名亦非利。利益和恐惧都不能激发古典风格作者的创作。他也没有什么内在的焦虑或野心。自然，古典风格作者也不受时间限制。

我们把效率看作抢夺时间的武器，或是提高生产力的工具。效率专家的工作是省时省钱。这类效率是一种竞争手段。

古典风格作者的效率只是思想问题。思想的效率与优雅、准确并行，效率达不到，也很难达到优雅、准确。古典风格作者的思想专注而清晰，自然能写出高效的古典文章。古典风格作者可以随兴思考，没有干扰，没有压力。没有什么东西能催促古典风格作者。因此，古典文章没有免责声明，比如作者有充分的时间可以做得更好，或者因为时间有限只好缩减或只能略掉某些内容。其实古典风格作者写完一句话后会稍做停留，就好像要细品这句话的余韵，接着才写下一句。

专注但不紧张

武术表演的学生说，表演前如果肌肉太紧张，就发挥不好，因为紧张就无法蓄势而发。古典风格给人的印象是，作者的绝大部分能量直接用于写作，不会消耗任何能量在焦虑或恐惧上。古典风格作者写完一句非常古典的话后，会沉浸到一种安宁的状态，由此开始下一个绝对高效的动作。

如果我们将放松的状态理解为不过度紧张但仍全神贯注，那么我们可以说，古典风格在表演时也是放松的，就像一流的赛马或短跑运动员在一种放松的状态中全速奔跑。低效努力是初学者的标志。

#### 1.4.4 Cast

Elite Is Not Exclusive

Classic style rests on an implied view of human nature that finds echoes in many religious traditions: left to themselves, people are sure to get things wrong; but with effort and discipline anyone can get the essential things right. Are the saints an elite? Of course. But sanctity, unlike, say, noble birth, is accessible to anyone who is willing to make the effort. So it is with classic style. The elitism of classic style is not the result of natural endowment. It is the result of effort and discipline ending in achievement. No one willing to make the effort is excluded from joining this elite.

The elitism of classic style has nothing to do with the object of presentation, which can range from fine wines to deep sewer tunnels. It has nothing to do with the connoisseurship of the writer either. The writer may speak with a technical mastery not possessed by the reader, but his attitude is always that the reader lacks this mastery only accidentally. You could know what he knows, and you would if you were standing where he stands, which is where the classic writer is trying to place you.

Classic Style Is for Everybody

Imagine someone sitting down to study the works of Marcel Proust, or Ezra Pound, or Walt Whitman with a view to learning to write as they did. It seems absurd, the ambition of a crackpot who does not have the first clue about style. Imagine trying to learn to write like Coleridge, Poe, Faulkner, or Baudelaire. These writers' styles are so suffused with their personalities and have been forged in pursuit of such specific and idiosyncratic goals that no one can acquire their styles short of becoming the writers in question and adopting their goals. The attempt obviously cannot succeed and if pursued to the end results in grotesque impersonation expressed as unconscious parody.

Classic style, by contrast, was assembled out of attitudes and techniques that are available to everybody and independent of any specific subject. There is a definite and knowable path to learning classic style, and you can acquire it fully. When you do, it is yours. The classic writer is impersonating no one. On the contrary, although the classic writer has learned a style instead of having invented one, his attitudes and techniques are authentic to himself. The writer is not appropriated by the style. It is possible to distinguish at a glance between Pascal, Descartes, and La Rochefoucauld. But unlike idiosyncratic styles, classic style is not shaped by the details of a writer's personality or the details of his subject. Neither is it a medium specifically designed to receive the imprint of a whole personality in all of its mysterious individuality. The project of a writer such as Proust, inseparable as it is from the details of his personality, is not a classic project. One consequence of his success in creating a style that answers his needs so well is that his style cannot usefully be adopted to anyone else's.

The Reader Is Competent

Classic style is modeled not merely on speech but on the core concept of conversation — conversation between equals. There is an implicit symmetry in the relationship between the writer and the reader. The model assumes that the reader could take the next turn in the conversation.

Those who have made the effort to acquire classic style comprise, then, a complementary cast of competent writers and competent readers. Becoming competent in this sense consists in being dispassionate enough to see things straight and to present what you have seen without the special pleading of someone whose interests affect her judgments. Such「competence」will seem illusory to many. Can anyone ever see things straight? Can anyone present what she has seen without her interests affecting her judgments? Classic style rests on the enabling assumption that the answers to these questions are yes and yes. When doubt about whether anyone can actually see anything straight and doubt about whether anyone can present what she sees without the distortion of special pleading suffuses a writer's style, that style cannot be classic.

The writer and the reader achieve their competence in the same way. The writer may know something that the reader does not, but the reader has access, in principle, to the same source of knowledge that serves the writer. There is a tacit reference to a shared standard that creates a symmetrical relationship between the writer and the reader. The duc de La Rochefoucauld's description of Madame de Chevreuse rests on this sort of tacit reference. La Rochefoucauld knew her; his readers do not, yet there is an almost irresistible conviction to his description. That conviction rests on the unspoken premise that if we knew her, we would notice what the writer noticed. The writer takes no credit for noticing just these things, and contrasting them in just this way. His unspoken claim is that it would be altogether peculiar not to notice these things and contrast them in this way.

We can see something of this deep conviction that all competent people observe the same things in a passage from Pride and Prejudice. Elizabeth Bennet and her sister Jane are discussing Charlotte Lucas's marriage to Mr. Collins. Elizabeth says that she is scandalized at her friend Charlotte's marriage to a man for whom no right-thinking woman could possibly have any regard. Jane replies that, in forming this judgment, Elizabeth has not「made allowance enough for difference in situation and temper.」Here is part of Elizabeth's answer

[W]ere I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her understanding than I now do of her heart. My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as I do; and you must feel as well as I do, that the woman who marries him, cannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though it is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of danger, security for happiness.

If Elizabeth thought that situation and temper could make a difference in how someone judges Mr. Collins, it would destroy her ability to talk freely to Jane. She would be obliged to hold back her judgments, and that would necessarily alter the whole style of their relationship. Charlotte's decision to marry Mr. Collins has altered forever her relationship to Elizabeth because they can no longer be open and truthful to one another. Jane has seen the same things Elizabeth has seen and they judge Mr. Collins by the same standards, so in the absence of incompetence or special pleading, they must reach the same conclusions.

This assumed symmetry between writer and reader saves the prototypical classic writer from appearing to stoop to mere grinding persuasion. The classic writer does not have to persuade the reader. All he has to do is offer the reader an unobstructed view, and of course the reader will see. This is the stance, for example, of the Declaration of Independence and of Pascal's Lettres provinciales: any reasonable person not corrupted by interest would have to agree; their writers are not arguing, they are presenting. As the Declaration puts it,「To prove [that the King is a Tyrant], let Facts be submitted to a candid world.」The Declaration then lists facts, as if the conclusion to be drawn from them is evident to anyone who has「a proper way of thinking.」

The relationship between writer and reader in classic style is based on an unspecified set of perceptions and values held in common. When a writer makes a decision, it is presented as if it is a decision that the reader is equally capable of making. The silent convention is that a competent reader who had seen the evidence would have made the same decision. The reader does not have to regard the writer as having superior judgment or having access to information not independently available to the reader.

Here is the New Testament scholar C. H. Dodd explaining why he has rejected the idea of rearranging the textual materials of the Fourth Gospel before undertaking a detailed interpretation of the text:

Many attempts have been made to improve the work by rearrangement of its material. Some of these have been (as it were) canonized by being adopted in large and important editions of the Fourth Gospel, and in modern translations. I have examined several of these rearrangements, and cannot sufficiently admire the patience and endless ingenuity which have gone into their making. It is of course impossible to deny that the work may have suffered dislocation, and plausible grounds may be alleged for lifting certain passages out of their setting, where there seems to be some prima facie breach of continuity. Unfortunately, when once the gospel has been taken to pieces, its reassemblage is liable to be affected by individual preferences, preconceptions and even prejudices. Meanwhile the work lies before us in an order which (apart from insignificant details) does not vary in the textual tradition, traceable to an early period. I conceive it to be the duty of an interpreter at least to see what can be done with the document as it has come down to us before attempting to improve upon it. This is what I shall try to do. I shall assume as a provisional working hypothesis that the present order is not fortuitous, but deliberately devised by somebody — even if it were only a scribe doing his best — and that the person in question (whether the author or another) had some design in mind, and was not necessarily irresponsible or unintelligent. If the attempt to discover any intelligible thread of argument should fail, then we may be compelled to confess that we do not know how the work was originally intended to run. If on the other hand it should appear that the structure of the gospel as we have it has been shaped in most of its details by the ideas which seem to dominate the author's thoughts, then it would appear not improbable that we have his work before us substantially in the form which he designed.

In making his decision, Dodd takes the position that the reader, once the essential evidence has been assembled, will see precisely what he does. Even though scholarly editors of「large and important editions of the Fourth Gospel」have made a different decision, it requires only a disinterested review of evidence that is in principle accessible to anyone who might care to examine it to allow the reader to see not merely why Dodd has chosen not to rearrange the textual materials of the gospel but why anyone not positively perverse or whose judgment is not affected by personal preferences, preoccupations, or prejudice would do the same thing. In his presentation, his decision is not the product of his exceptional insight, or special knowledge, or personal experience. It has nothing to do with his situation or temper. Provided he is right when he says that the work「(apart from insignificant details) does not vary in the textual tradition, traceable to an early period」 — something that can presumably be verified — his decision can be confirmed by anyone who wishes to undertake the investigation he has. There is a silent assumption that part of the reader's competence consists in his agreeing with the writer about what can serve as a proper investigation of this point. It does not affect this attitude in the least if the reader of this passage has, let us say, no knowledge of Hellenistic Greek, no experience with textual materials of this sort, and has never even heard of the large and important editions of the Fourth Gospel that have patiently and ingeniously rearranged the text. All this is merely information, which, in principle, anyone can acquire in just the same way Dodd himself acquired it.

This sense of shared competence is characteristic of the relationship between writer and reader in classic style. There is always a tacit appeal to a standard of perception and judgment that is assumed to be general, rather than special. There is no need for the writer to make appeals to his sincerity, for example, or to some special insight or competence, to arcane or technical knowledge, or to a lifetime of experience obviously not available to everyone else.

Consider how different this attitude is from one in which the author speaks to the reader from an assumed position of superiority.「Reader, you think that high unemployment is bad for an economy because you don't know the first thing about economics; you think that light makes the retina transmit signals because you can't tell the difference between old wives' tales and biochemistry; you think that authors write texts because you don't know the difference between literature and textual modes of domination; you think marriage is normal because you've been taken in by a repressive society. You're lucky you picked up this book, my friend, because you need help. You need it bad.」The classic symmetry between writer and reader is broken whenever the writer presents distinctions as if they are the product of her own exceptional insight or temper, distinctions the reader could not have been trusted to see on his own in the right circumstances.

It is broken in a different but complementary way when the writer speaks as if from a knowledge of facts that is, in principle, private. The narrator of Proust's A la recherche du temps perdu breaks the classic symmetry between writer and reader in just this way. He dips a kind of cookie called a madeleine into a cup of tea, tastes it, and has his past come flooding into his memory in hallucinatory detail. The reader of this passage normally has no inclination to doubt the truth of what the narrator says, but neither can the reader verify it by furnishing himself with tea and madeleines of his own. There are all sorts of rhetorical inducements to believe the narrator, but then, you just have to believe him. You cannot see what he sees, and your exclusion is not accidental, as it is when a writer presents events he saw in the 1930s or conversation she heard at the court of Henri IV. Instead, you are in principle excluded from ever being able to verify the narrator's experience.

In「What Is an Author?」Michel Foucault defines a relationship between writer and reader that is asymmetric in both ways: he appeals tacitly to both his own superior judgment and private evidence. In his essay, Foucault observes that before Mallarmé, the concept「literary work」has a kind of validity that it does not have afterward because it is supplanted by「textual modes of domination.」There may be reasons to accept what Foucault says, but it is not presented as the sort of observation that a reader can confirm by examining evidence that is, in principle, accessible to anyone who cares to look at it. It is extraordinary really that no one before Foucault seems to have noticed this remarkable rupture in the history of literature. Foucault does not address the point, but if a reader were to pursue it and ask how it came about that something so fundamental had never before been noticed, the answer has two related but distinct parts. First, Foucault's ability to see what others have not is a consequence of his superior competence. Second, that superior competence defines the relevant evidence. That is why Foucault cannot point his reader to the evidence on which he has reached his conclusion in the way Dodd can. The competence needed to confirm Dodd by reviewing his evidence would take most of a lifetime to acquire — the linguistic, historical, and technical knowledge needed to conduct an investigation of the manuscript tradition of the Fourth Gospel and a critical review of the decisions made by its modern editors — but hundreds of people have acquired such competence and anyone who wants to is, in principle, free to do so. Foucault's evidence is difficult of access not merely because it requires competence that most people do not have and in practice cannot acquire; on the contrary, it is, in principle, private. You would need Foucault's superior insight even to realize that his evidence is evidence: it is, after all, exactly what everyone else since Mallarmé has been looking at without being able to realize that it is evidence for a historical discontinuity between literary works and textual modes of domination.

A reader can accept the idea that Foucault has superior competence, but the reader does not and cannot share that superior competence and, as a result, cannot share his perception either. He can merely be told about it. In classic prose, the relationship between writer and reader is never asymmetrical in this way because classic style appeals to a standard of perception and of judgment assumed to be general, rather than special.

The Writer Is Authentic

The classic writer stands fully behind what she has to say because she has thought it out independently. It may be that in thinking something out independently she has come to a common conclusion, but in expressing it she is neither joining a chorus nor embracing a platitude. Her conclusion is the product of her own thought. As a consequence, even when a classic writer reaches a common conclusion, it has the freshness of discovery. It does not come from camaraderie or conformity. She does not expect its common acceptance to be the evidence that causes it to be believed. It is possible to repeat clichés or say what you think you must to get people to believe you, but the classic stylist appears to have nothing to do with these activities.

It is not the accumulated acceptance of other people — even if these other people are right — that gives force to classic writing. It is the writer's conviction that she has earned a conclusion. To convince another competent person of what is being said does not involve appeals to authority or traditional wisdom or anything other than a simple presentation of the order of reason leading to that conclusion, so that someone else can also reach it independently.

This sort of thing happens every day. When a high school geometry student proves the Pythagorean theorem, she is not breaking new ground in mathematics. But if she has actually worked out the proof herself, she — not Pythagoras — stands behind the theorem. She can respond to any possible challenge by presenting her authentically personal — even if quite common — proof. Someone who copies the identical proof without understanding it cannot stand behind it. Under challenge, the inauthentic geometer has nothing better to offer than lame appeals to widespread acceptance:「Every geometry book since Euclid says this theorem is true, so it must be.」

The Writer Is Sufficient

The classic writer perceives truth and, as a corollary, enjoys a uniquely open and incomparably full communication with the society of other people who perceive truth. It would be inaccurate to say that there is absolutely nothing the writer wants from the reader, because the writer does indeed want the reader to belong to that society as well, so much so that he treats the reader as someone who is already a member.

But there is nothing else the classic writer wants from the reader, and nothing at all that the classic writer needs from the reader: the classic writer will present truth without distortion or special pleading even if there is, in fact, no competent reader available.

Above all, the classic writer never appears to be pursuing self-interest. There is nothing the classic writer needs, and so there is nothing the classic writer is trying to get from the reader.

The Writer Is Competent

It is paralyzing to think of how many things can go wrong in an attempt to present something clearly and accurately. Perhaps you cannot see straight. Perhaps you cannot express what you see. Perhaps your conceptual instruments are dull. You might have disabling gaps in your knowledge. You might be lying to yourself.

The situation is not much better even if you have no fears about these potential sources of impotence, because the reader might have doubts, and then you have a different problem: how do you deal with the doubts of the reader?

It is enough to stop some people from writing. Even worse, from the classic point of view, it is enough to convince some people that they should allow their doubts about their own problematic situation as writers to supplant all other subjects, since these doubts are the only things that seem certain.

Classic style frees writers from anxiety or silence by making the enabling assumption that the writer is competent. Truth, which is available to all, can be seen and presented by this writer. Such a competence is no more impossible or problematic than the competence of quite ordinary high school students to prove the Pythagorean theorem. A writer does not have to be omniscient; he just needs an everyday form of competence — the competence of knowing what he needs to know for this talk. His mind is in order and his facts are straight.

The result of this enabling convention is prose that is unclotted and that stays on track. In reality, all the doubts surrounding any writer's situation remain. Both writer and reader know them, so it is merely tedious to rehearse them. There is something at least mildly fraudulent about offering to present a subject and then substituting for it the problematic nature of the presentation.「Let me tell you how to make bread pudding. My God, have you any idea of how impossible it is actually to explain how to cook in writing? I can make bread pudding myself — done it a hundred times — but it's impossible to put into words how to know when you've got the right consistency. . . .」

The enabling convention that the writer is competent goes hand in hand with the absence of hedges in classic prose. There are styles of academic, legal, and business prose in which the motive is to ensure that no challenge can be raised that has not already been acknowledged by the writer, so that the writer is「covered.」Some of these challenges concern the activities of thinking and presenting. Writers in these styles typically work hard to demonstrate that they have anticipated challenges: Could the writer have been deluded by his prejudices? Could there be crucial missing facts? Could the writer's language be radically and irresolvably ambiguous, even self-defeating?

These anticipations are largely pointless, because it is usually impossible to prove a negative (「No, it is in principle impossible that I could be deluded by prejudice,」「No, there could be no crucial missing fact,」「No, there could be no reader, however perverse, able to misunderstand what I am saying」). Classic style sees nothing to be accomplished by rehearsing these questions, and so eliminates them from the outset.

This enabling convention is made to save writer and reader from spinning their wheels on uncertain ground to no possible effect, but it is not made to constrain the reader's belief. The writer speaks with confidence, and this can be compelling; but the reader will bring his full competence to bear and will make his own judgment about whether the writer is right or wrong. The reader may conclude that a text is masterful, classic, and completely wrong. In classic prose, the writer takes the pose of competence so as not to waste our time with distractions as he presents those things that allow us to decide whether he really is competent.

The Writer Does All the Work Invisibly

Suggestion is powerful, since people believe a conclusion more readily if they think they have helped to reach it or have reached it themselves.

A catalogue of styles of suggestion would be long and varied. It would range from subliminal suggestion, in which the writer tries to give the reader all the credit by hiding the suggestion, to what we will call domestic moral suggestion, which consists of posing a problem, garnished with appropriate facts, as if you cannot see what to do, in the hope that the slow-witted spouse, sibling, child, or parent addressed will recognize his duty and get on with it. There are poetic styles of suggestion, as in haiku, in which luminous details are juxtaposed so as to launch the reader toward a perception that is never stated. There are mystic styles, which view truth as something that can be hinted at but never grasped intellectually or expressed accurately. There is participatory suggestion, in which the speaker as if by chance arrays all the right details and begins to grope toward a conclusion but has difficulty and turns to the reader to work out the rest. There is lotus-eater suggestion, which consists of some ill-formed attempts, combined with a few gestures, and closed off with the lame,「You know what I mean.」

Classic style is not a style of suggestion. All necessary refinements have been made and are accurately expressed.

There are other styles in which the writer does all the work, but he does it under the reader's nose:「And now I think I need some decorative ornament with which to finish this off, a finial of some sort, so to make that I will have to fire up the lathe, and get the right piece of wood; let's see, this one won't do, it has a crack; we need one that has just the right grain; yes, here, now we mount this on the lathe. . . .」The classic writer, by contrast, does all the work invisibly. She pulls the finished finial out of her pocket. The classic writer is not like a television cook showing you how to mix mustard and balsamic vinegar. She is like a chef whose work is presented to you at table but whose labor you are never allowed to see, a labor the chef certainly does not expect you to share. There are no salt and pepper shakers on your table.

1.4.4 角色

人人可成为精英

与许多宗教传统不谋而合，古典风格基于一条没有言明的人性观点：放任不管，人肯定会犯错，但经过努力和训练，任何人都能做对基础的事情。圣人是精英吗？当然。但神圣跟生来高贵不同，只要愿意努力，任何人都可以成为圣人。古典风格也是如此。古典风格的精英主义并非出于本能，而是努力与训练终有所得的结果。一个愿意努力的人，不会被古典风格精英拒之门外。

古典风格的精英主义与呈现什么无关，从精致的葡萄酒到阴森的下水道都可以呈现。这与作者的鉴赏力也无关。作者讲述的口吻可能是他掌握了读者不会的专业知识，但他的态度始终是，读者只是因为偶然原因才没有掌握。你可以知道他知道的，而且自然会知道，只要你站在他所在的位置，这正是古典风格作者努力让你身处其中的地方。

人人可学会古典风格

想象一个人坐下来研究马尔塞·普鲁特斯（Marcel Proust）或者埃兹拉·庞德（Ezra Pound）或者沃尔特·惠特曼（Walt Whitman）的作品，为了学习像他们一样写作。这看起来很荒谬，像一个完全不懂风格的人幻想着成为大师。想象一下，尝试学着像柯勒律治（coleridge）、爱伦坡（Poe）、福克纳（Faulkner）或波德莱尔（Baudelaire）一样写作。这些作家的风格个性鲜明，由于追求一些特别且怪诞的目标形成了独特的风格，没人能学会他们的风格，除非成为他们那样的作家，并设立他们那样的目标。这种尝试显然不会成功，如果非要坚持，模仿怪诞不成，还变成一种无意识的滑稽。

相比之下，古典风格的技能和态度，每个人都能学会，且与主题无关。学习古典风格有确切可知的路径，而且你完全可以掌握这种风格。只要你学会了，它就是你自己的风格。古典风格作者不用模仿任何人。相反，虽然古典风格作者是学会一种风格，而不是发明一种风格，但他的态度和技巧仍属于他自己。作者不会隐没于古典风格之下。帕斯卡、笛卡儿和拉罗什福科的文章一眼就能区分出来。与怪诞风格不同，古典风格不是由作者的人格特征或它的主题细节决定的。它也不是专为表达作者的神秘个性及其背后的完整人格的某种媒介。像普鲁斯特这类作家的作品，因为与他的个性特点密不可分，不属于古典风格。他创造的风格如此独到，以至于只能满足自己的需要，而无法适用于任何其他人。

读者可以胜任

古典风格不仅模仿说话的方式，而且模仿对话的核心理念 —— 平等对话。作者和读者之间有一种隐含的对等关系。这种模式假定对话时读者可以应答。

那些努力追求古典风格的人，可以说由一组互补角色构成，即胜任的作者和胜任的读者。这里的胜任在于能够客观公正地看清事物、呈现事物，不受任何人的利益影响。这种「胜任」对许多人来说似乎不切实际。人真的能够看清事物吗？人真的能不受利益驱使客观地呈现所见之物吗？对两个问题的肯定回答是古典风格依存的基础假设。如果一位作者的风格总是怀疑人是否真的能看清事物，以及人是否能放下一己私利客观呈现所见之物，那肯定不是古典风格。

作者和读者胜任古典风格的方式是一样的。作者可能知道读者不知道的东西，但原则上，为作者所用的知识来源可以同样为读者所用。默认参照的是共同标准，这种标准为作者与读者建立起一种对等关系。拉罗什福科描述谢弗勒兹夫人就有这种默认参照。拉罗什福科知道她，他的读者不知道。但他的描述有一种几乎不容置疑的坚定。这种坚定源于一条隐含前提：如果我们知道她，作者注意到的我们也会注意到。虽然作者注意到这些东西并用这种方式对比，但他没有归为自己的功劳。他的潜台词是，没注意到这些东西、没用这样的方式对比，才令人奇怪。

我们可以从《傲慢与偏见》的一段话中看到这种坚定，即所有胜任的人都能观察到同样的事物。伊丽莎白·班纳特和她的妹妹简正在讨论夏洛特·卢卡斯嫁给柯林斯先生这件事。伊丽莎白说，她很气愤，她没想到她的朋友夏洛特会嫁给一个这样的男人，凡是头脑正常的女人都不会看得起的男人。简回应说，伊丽莎白做出这一判断时没有「充分考虑到处境和性情的差别」。伊丽莎白对此的部分回答如下：

假如让我相信夏洛特当真爱上了柯林斯，那我就觉得她不仅没有情感，而且还缺乏理智。亲爱的简，柯林斯先生是个自高自大、心胸狭窄的蠢汉，这一点你跟我一样清楚。你还会跟我一样感到，哪个女人肯嫁给他，一定是头脑糊涂。虽说这个女人就是夏洛特·卢卡斯，你也不要为她辩护。你不能为了某一个人而改变原则和准绳，也不要试图说服我或你自己，认为自私自利就是谨慎，胆大妄为就能确保幸福。① 10

① 汉语翻译选自孙致礼译本。—— 译者注

如果伊丽莎白认为这种处境和性情会影响一个人对柯林斯先生的评价，她就无法与简自由交流。她只会对自己的看法闭口不谈，这必定会改变她俩关系的整体风格。夏洛特嫁给柯林斯先生的决定永远改变了她与伊丽莎白的关系，因为她们再也不能坦诚相待。伊丽莎白看到的事情简同样看到了，她们评判柯林斯先生的标准也一样，所以如果不是无法胜任，也不是受了一己私利的蒙蔽，她们肯定会得出同样的结论。

因为作者与读者这种假定的对等关系，典型的古典风格作者不至于看起来据理力争。古典风格作者不必说服读者。他只需为读者提供一处没有障碍的视角，读者自然会看到。这就是《独立宣言》和帕斯卡的《致外省人信札》的立场：任何理智的、未被利欲熏心的人都会认同；它们的作者不辩解，只呈现。正如《独立宣言》中的一句话，「为了证明这一点（大不列颠国王是暴君），特向公正的世人陈述以下事实。」接着《独立宣言》列出事实，好像结论是显然的，凡能「正确思考」的人都看得出来。

古典风格中作者与读者之间的关系，基于他们都具备某些洞察力和价值观。当作者做出某个决定时，就好像读者也有能力做出同样的决定。不成文的规定是，一位胜任的读者如果看到证据会做出同样的决定。读者不用觉得，作者的判断高人一等，或掌握着读者无法获取的信息。

新约学者 C. H. 多德（C.H.Dodd）这样解释为什么没做文本解读时不会考虑重新编排第四部福音书的文本材料：

为改善第四部福音书的文本，人们已经做了很多重新编排工作。有一些（可以说是）已经奉为经典，被用作第四部福音书的重大版本和现代翻译版本。我查过几个重新编排的版本，由衷敬佩他们编排时的耐心和无尽才思。当然无法否认，编排工作会出现错乱，某个位置的内容，乍看起来破坏了原文的连贯性，移到别的位置或许看起来有它的道理。不幸的是，一旦福音书被拆解得支离破碎，重新编排很容易受个人偏好、先入之见甚至偏见影响。对比之下，我们前人编排福音书的顺序（除了不重要的细节外）沿袭了同样的文本传统，可以追溯到早期。我认为这是解读者的职责：试着改善原文本之前，至少先看看这些传承至今的材料能怎么用。这是我会努力做的事情。我会先假定一个初步设想，现在的顺序不是随意编排的，而是有人用心构思过 —— 哪怕只是一个抄写员尽自已的职责 —— 而且负责编排的人（无论作者还是其他人）心里有自己的设计，并不一定就是不负责或不聪明。如果我们没有找到论述的脉络，我们就不得不承认我们不知道原作最初的意图是什么。另一方面，如果现行版福音书的结构编排在大部分细节上尽量靠近作者的主要思想，他的作品延续至今仍大体上保持他最初的设计形式也不无可能。11

多德做出这项决定的立场是，读者一旦收集到必要的证据，就会确切地看到他做的事情。虽然一些博学的编辑在编排第四部福音书「重大版本」上做了不同的决定，但只要读者客观地复查证据 —— 原则上任何有心核查证据的人都能查到 —— 不仅会明白为什么多德选择拒绝重新编排福音书的文本材料，也会明白凡是不故意违背常理的人，凡是不让个人偏好、先入之见或偏见影响自己判断的人，都会做出同样的选择。正如他讲的，他的决定并非源自他过人的远见、特殊的学识，或个人的经验。这与他的处境或性情没有关系。假设下面这句话他说对了，「（除了不重要的细节外）沿袭了同样的文本传统，可以追溯到早期」—— 想必这是可以验证的信息 —— 任何愿意做他那样调查研究的人都会做出同样的决定。这里隐含着一种假设：读者的部分能力表现在，像作者一样知道什么样的调查研究够分量。哪怕这篇文章的读者，比如不懂古希腊语，没有处理这类文本材料的经验，甚至都没听说过第四部福音书有一个经过耐心而巧妙的重新编排的重大版本。所有这些都只是信息，原则上，任何人都可以用多德那样的方式获取这些信息。

同等胜任感是古典风格作者与读者的关系特点。一直以来，观察和判断默认诉诸普遍标准而非特殊标准。作者没必要诉诸一些别人无法求证的东西，比如他的虔诚、某些特别的洞见或能力、晦涩或专业的知识或毕生的经验。

想想与作者的自我优越感相比，这两种态度多么不同。「读者，你认为失业率太高对经济不利，因为你不懂经济的利害关系；你认为光线使视网膜传输信号，因为你分不清什么是老妇人的离奇故事，什么是生物化学；你认为作者的工作是写文字材料，因为你不知道文学和主要文本形式之间的区别；你认为缔结婚姻很正常，因为你受了专制社会的蒙骗。你能遇到这本书是你的幸运，我的朋友，因为你需要帮助，太需要了。」一旦作者表现得好像只有具备他那样超凡脱俗的洞见或性情，才能发现这些区别，而读者不管在什么样的位置都不可能自己看到，作者与读者之间的古典对等关系就会被打破。

另一种不同但互补的方式，也会破坏这种关系，那就是作者说的事实依据基本上源于个人。普鲁斯特《追忆似水年华》（A la recherche du temps perdu）这本书中的叙述者就是用这种方式破坏了作者与读者的古典对等关系。他用一种马德琳（madeleines）饼干蘸茶吃时，过往的记忆像潮水般涌出，虚幻又真切。读这篇文章的人一般想不到要怀疑叙述者所言是真是假，也不能自己用马德琳饼干蘸茶吃来验证。叙述者可以借用各种修辞手法诱使别人相信他，但那样，你也只能相信他而已。你看不见他看到的东西，这不是偶然，因为他说的好像是，他在 20 世纪 30 年代看到的事情，或者他在亨利四世的宫廷听到的对话。事实上，你完全被排除在外，不可能验证叙述者的经历。

米歇尔·福科（Michel Foucault）在《作者是什么》（What Is an Author）这篇文章 12 指出作者与读者之间的不对等关系表现在两个方面：作者默认依据的是优越的判断力和非公开证据。福柯在他的文章中写到，在马拉美（Mallarme）之前，「文学作品」（Literary work）这个概念有更广泛的效力，因为后来被「主要文本形式」（textual modes of domination）取代了。福柯所言或许自有依据，但呈现出来的不是那种可以经读者自行验证的观察，原则上只要愿意，任何人都能查到证据验证真伪。确实奇怪，福柯之前似乎没人注意过文学史上出现过这种显著的断层。福柯没有回答这点，但如果读者追间为什么这么基本的问题以前从未注意过，答案可以分为两个部分，彼此相关又互不相同。一是，福柯有超乎常人的能力，能看到别人看不到的东西。二是，超乎常人意味着思考的依据也不同寻常。这就是为什么福柯不能像多德那样向读者指出结论的依据。要想验证多德的话，我们可能需要花费大半生的时间获得 —— 研究第四部福音书手稿传统需要的语言知识、历史知识和专业知识，以及现代编辑批判性审查的决策力 —— 但已有数百人获得了这些能力，原则上任何有意愿的人都可以这样做。福柯的证据很难获得，这种能力不仅大多数人没有，而且实际上无法获得；相反，他的证据基本都是个人的。甚至你需要具备福柯那样超乎常人的洞察力，才能意识到他的证据是证据：毕竟，这是自马拉美以来所有人都能看到却没意识到的事实，是文学作品与主要文本形式之间存在历史断层的证据。

读者可以这么认为，福柯拥有过人的能力，但读者没有，所以理解不了他那种过人能力，自然不能像他那样观察事物。他只能从作者那里知道。在古典文章中，作者与读者不会发生这种不对等关系，因为在古典风格中，观察和判断依据的是普遍标准而不是特殊标准。

作者真实可信

古典风格作者能佐证自己说的话，因为这是他独立思考出来的。尽管独立思考得出的是普通结论，但他的表达不是拾人牙慧或人云亦云。他的结论是自己的思考成果。因此，尽管古典风格作者得出的是普通结论，对他来说也是一种新奇发现。这种新奇不是因为有相同体验或与别人一致。他不希望结论因为是人所共知的才被相信。说别人说过的话，说让人相信你的话，并不是古典风格作者的作风。

不是越来越多的人的认同 —— 哪怕这些人是对的 —— 赋予古典文章力量。而是因为作者的笃定，他自己得出了结论。要让一位胜任古典风格的人相信作者说的话，不用依靠权威或传统智慧或任何其他方式，只要呈现如何得出结论的推理顺序，这样其他人也能独立推理出结论。

这种事情每天都发生。一名高中生在几何课上证明了毕达哥拉斯定理，不代表他在数学上做出新突破。但如果是他自己推导出来的，而不是毕达哥拉斯，那么面对任何质疑，他都能举出真正属于自己的证明，尽管有可能很普通。但如果未经理解只是照抄推导过程，就无法提供直接证明。没有亲自推导几何定理的人面对质疑，只会无力附和公认如此：「自欧几里得以来所有几何书都这么写，那它肯定是对的。」

作者自得其乐

古典风格作者观察真相，自然也乐意与其他观察真相的群体坦率、充分地交流。要说作者对读者毫无所求也不完全对，因为作者确实希望读者能加入这个群体，他的希望如此真切以至默认读者早就是其中的一员了。

但除此之外，古典风格作者对读者别无所求，也不需要读者回馈什么：古典风格作者不会为了一己私利歪曲真相，即使实际上没有能胜任的读者。

最重要的是，古典风格作者不会表现出一副为己谋私的样子。古典风格作者什么也不需要，所以也不会想着从读者那里获得什么。

作者可以胜任

一想到清晰准确地呈现事物会遇到多少阻碍，就已经让人不敢动笔。也许你无法看清事物。也许你无法表达你看到的事物。也许你的脑子迟钝缓慢。你可能缺乏必要的知识。你可能会对自己撒谎。

就算你不担心这些会让你无能为力的潜在问题，情况也不会好到哪去，因为读者可能有疑虑，新问题来了：你如何消除读者的疑虑？

这足以让一些人放弃写作。更糟的是，从古典风格的角度来看，这足以让一些人陷入对自身作者身份所处困境的怀疑，以至放弃可能的各种主题，因为只有这些怀疑看起来确定无疑。

为避免作者陷入焦虑与沉默中，古典风格假定作者可以胜任。真相人人都能看到，作者能看到，也有能力呈现出来。这种能力相当于普通中学生证明毕达哥拉斯定理的能力，没有什么不可能，也不会太难。作者不需要无所不知，他只要具备日常所需的能力一知道自己要知道什么才能说清楚。思考有序，所言事实自然有条理。

有了这条基本规约，写文章就不会动不了笔，而是直入正题。实际上作者心中的疑虑都还在。作者知道，读者也知道，翻来覆去地说也没意思。要是呈现某个事物，一直讲呈现它怎么怎么难，多少让人觉得受骗了。「我会告诉你们如何做面包布丁。我的天，你知道用文字表述烹饪过程有多难吗？我自己会做面包布丁 —— 做过一百次了 —— 但不可能用文字说清楚合适的黏稠度是什么样的。」

古典文章中，作者能胜任这条基本规约，与不闪烁其词是相辅相成的。学术、法律和商业类文章都有各自的写作风格，它们的动机是「掩护」作者，防止别人提出作者还没确认的质疑。其中一些质疑是思想和呈现层面的。这类风格的作者费尽心思证明自己已经预见了各种质疑：作者会受自己的偏见蒙蔽吗？是否遗漏重要事实？作者的用语会不会含混不清、难以理解，甚至自相矛盾？

这些预防大都没有意义，因为否定回答一般无法验证（「不会，原则上我不可能受偏见蒙蔽」「不会，不可能遗漏重要事实」「不会，读者再怎么不近情理也不至于误解我的话」）。古典风格认为，反复说这些问题毫无意义，所以从一开始就不去考虑它们。

这条基本规约是为了避免作者和读者把时间浪费在不确定且没有结果的事情上，但并不是要限制读者的想法。作者说话笃定，才会让人信服；但读者会竭尽所能，对作者的对错做出自己的判断。读者的结论可能是：文章水准高、有古典风范、错得离谱。古典文章的作者要写出能胜任的姿态，而不是说些主题之外的事物浪费我们的时间，因为我们可以根据他呈现的事物判断他是否真能胜任。

作者私下做好全部工作

暗示的力量很强大，因为人们更愿意相信经他们参与得出或完全自己得出的结论。

暗示有不同风格，且种类繁多。从潜意识暗示到家庭寓意暗示不一而足，比如作者隐藏暗示让读者自己领会；比如你要跟反应慢的配偶、兄弟姐妹、孩子或者父母讲道理，指出问题时你会讲一些适当的事例，好像你不知道怎么做，等着他们认识到自己的职责，主动解决问题。有诗歌风格暗示，如俳句，只把鲜明的细节并列在一起，让读者自己观察和发现其中隐含的意思；有神秘风格暗示，这种风格认为真相只可意会，但不能条分缕析或准确表达出来；有参与类暗示，作者好像碰巧知道所有正确细节，但试着推理结论时遇到因难，于是让读者解决剩余的问题：有懒人风格（lotus-eater）暗示，要说又说不出来的样子，比画着手势，一句「你懂的」结束话题。

古典风格不是暗示型风格。它会完成所有必要的推敲，并准确表达出结论。

也有其他风格的作者会自己做好全部工作，但是在读者眼皮底下进行：「现在我想我需要一个装饰物来点缀收尾，可以用某种尖顶饰，做这个我需要启动车床，再找块合适的木头；我们来看看，这个不行，有裂缝；我们要找块有合适纹理的；这个可以，就它了，现在我们把它装到车床上…...」相反，古典风格作者会私下做好全部工作。他从口袋里掏出做好的尖顶饰。古典风格作者不像电视节目里的厨师，向你展示如何混合芥末和葡萄醋。他像一位主厨，他的工作是把菜端到你面前的餐桌上，但他辛苦的过程不会让你看到，他必定也不想你看到。你的桌上不会有盐瓶和胡椒瓶。

#### 1.4.5 Thought and Language

The Thought Can Stand Alone

In the classic stand on the elements of style, writing is neither a way of thinking something out nor an art that exists for its own sake. Writing is an instrument for presenting what the writer has already thought. It is a record of that thought only to the extent that the intellectual experience is indistinguishable from the order of reason. The text is not a document that implies an individual process of thought; it is not a text that refers primarily to other texts; it is a transparent way of presenting a separate reality. Classic style always implies that there is value in what it presents. Characteristically this implied value is twofold: what is presented is important and it is independently intelligible rather than valuable as part of something larger. The independently intelligible thought often carries an implicit appeal to a refined and clarified version of common experience. Classic writing is never「notes toward」a thought that might, if developed further, stand on its own, nor is it the fifth part of a systematic inquiry that is unintelligible to someone unfamiliar with the previous four parts.

Classic expression cannot justify itself in advance. It presumes upon the reader's attention as its right. To justify its presumption, it must offer something important, complete, self-contained, and intelligible. Descartes's Discourse, for example, historically considered, is a response to Montaigne's skepticism. But Montaigne is never mentioned there. Descartes's thought is offered as a freestanding fable of the writer's own experience, not as a reexamination of philosophic issues full of cross-references to the history of philosophy. Such a citational presentation could only indicate to the nonprofessional that the book cannot be read independently. In Descartes, and in many other classic writers, the style implies that anything requiring erudition, anything intelligible only to a professional or an erudite is fundamentally unimportant. The importance and intelligibility of classic expression do not depend upon special knowledge; they depend upon the reader's clear and focused mind. There is a tacit contract between writer and reader: the reader's closely focused intelligence will be repaid with something valuable and self-contained. Classic expression has the distinctive character and the neat finality of a Bach partita, which begins by breaking a silence and ends by returning to silence, leaving nothing unresolved.

One of Wallace Stevens's poems is called「The Poem That Took the Place of the Mountain.」The mountain existed before the poem and is independent of it. To a geologist, a mountain may be unintelligible by itself since it is an incident in the natural history of the earth, but it has a visual and nominal distinction and is, in common experience, an independent, distinct, and arresting object. The poem may require a dense network of concepts and conventions to be independently intelligible, but since these are widely shared within the culture in which it is written, the poem can be thought of as independently intelligible too. If we accept the idea that somehow a poem can「word for word」take the place of a mountain, we have a little emblem of classic style in which writing presents thought, nuance for nuance, in a distinct and intelligible frame.

Abstractions Can Be Clear and Exact

From the classic viewpoint, the distinction between abstract and concrete has no consequence. A writing instructor or consultant who advises us to write concretely and avoid abstractions offers shallow and impractical advice because the distinction is simpleminded. What matters is not the ontological category of the subject but rather the style in which it is conceived.

In romantic style, a tree could be conceived as if only the writer can see it for what it is. Its truth, then, has no existence independent of the writer; it depends upon the writer; to conceive of it as clear and exact would be to obliterate the writer's fragile and elusive insight, gained in a transporting moment of superior vision that language cannot express. In romantic style, there is no symmetry between writer and reader. That a tree itself is concrete does not impede a romantic writer from conceiving it in a manner unavailable to other observers, vaguely and indistinctly, as he might conceive the human soul.

By contrast, in classic style, the human soul can be conceived as clearly and exactly as the tree in front of your face. When a classic stylist presents an abstraction — cultural reality, heroism, historical causation, the nature of representation, taste — it is first conceived as independent of the writer, exhaustively definite at all levels of detail, visible to anyone competent who is standing in a position to see it, immediately recognizable, and capable of being expressed in direct and simple language.

Abstractions are not in themselves bad, vague, or inexact. They are only so in certain styles of conceiving them. When a classic writer deals in abstractions, it takes an effort to remind ourselves that she is not talking about a stone, a leaf, a statue. A classic writer presents the concrete diamond and its aesthetic beauty as if both are visible, clear, and exact.

Thought Precedes Speech

In the classic view, writing is not thinking. This runs counter to an extremely powerful and pervasive connection between a concept of writing and a concept of mind. Records are understood as a sort of external memory, and memory as internal records. Writing is thinking on paper, and thought is writing in the mind. The author's mind is an endless paper on which he writes, making mind internal writing; and the book he writes is external mind, the external form of that writing. The author is the self thinking. The self is the author writing in the mind. (Hamlet says,「Within the book and volume of my brain.」) Sometimes, the self is an author who records the process of his thinking on paper.

Classic style takes an entirely different view. Since it is a presentational style, this kind of writing, at least, depends upon a prior process of thought. It is having a thought that is the very motive for writing. The kind of thinking a classic writer does, inasmuch as he is a writer, is limited to strategic thinking about presentation and is never explicit. Thinking is not writing; even more important, writing is not thinking. This does not mean that in classic style all of the thinking precedes all of the writing, but rather that the classic writer does not write as he is thinking something out and does not think by writing something out. Between the period of one sentence and the beginning of the next, there is space for the flash of perfect thought, which is all the classic writer needs. The sentence begins only after the thought it expresses has been completed. To the classic writer, the difference between thinking and writing is as wide as the difference between cooking and serving. In every great restaurant there is a kitchen, where the work is done, and a dining room, where the result is presented. The dining room is serene, and the presentation suggests that perfection is routine and effortless, no matter how hectic things get in the kitchen. Naturally the kitchen and the dining room are in constant and intimate contact, but it is part of the protocol of a great restaurant to treat them as if they existed on different planets. The cooks do not sit down and relax in the dining room and the guests do not observe the work of the kitchen.

Seeing something is not the same as presenting something. We can present only what we have already seen and recognized. In classic style, thinking is seeing, or more generally, recognizing; writing is presenting what the writer has seen so the reader can see it, too. The classic writer seems to be trying to place something before your eyes or trying to put you where he is so you can see what he sees.

The Language Is Sufficient

There are styles of writing that suggest that while words are inadequate, there is nothing else available, so writers do the best they can without expecting their language to do more than approximate their thought. Classic style takes the opposite stand. There are not merely better and worse ways of expressing particular thoughts, there is a best way. Everything that can be known can be said. Moreover, it is always possible to achieve a perfect fit between a thought and its expression just as it is always possible to achieve a perfect solution to a problem in elementary algebra.

A few years ago, The Wall Street Journal ran a short article about a dispute between a French government agency and a group of French research scientists. The scientists were publishing a journal in English; the government agency objected on the plausible grounds that the results of scientific research done by French scientists and supported by the French government ought to be published in French. The scientists retorted that English had become, for most purposes, the international language of science, so if scientists want their research reports to be read, they simply have to be published in English. The point was given summary expression in the following sentence:「To shun English is to court isolation.」

This seven-word sentence has an economy, a symmetry, and a fit between thought and expression that suggest perfection, not compromise or approximation, and it is the sort of perfection that, once achieved, seems natural, not labored. It is something like tapping a golf ball with just enough force to sink it. It is a convention of classic style that every thought has a perfect expression; writers can fail to fit language to thought, but that is merely a failure of craftsmanship, not a limitation of the craftsman's material.

When we talk about a「way of putting」something, we suggest that there are many ways of expressing the same thought, each with its strengths and inescapable limitations. Any particular way of putting something is then just one way, necessarily incomplete and insufficient, so the price of putting a thought into any particular set of words is compromise.

The classic stand adopts as an enabling convention the opposite view: language is sufficient to any thought. Imperfect expression is the fault of limited writers, not limited language. It is not merely that the classic writer is a master of language; many writers in many styles are manifest masters of language. The classic writer works with the additional convention that the language he masters is sufficient to any thought. The classic writer must not make the language appear to struggle, giving the impression that the language is in over its head, fighting to survive. The classic writer does not use language to suggest a truth he cannot formulate. Suggestive language is merely imperfect use of language. Classic style avoids colloquialisms, neologisms, periphrases, and slang because it does not need them: the language is sufficient without them. New thoughts do not require new language.

Classic Thought and Classic Language Match

There are two kinds of fit between thought and language in classic style. The first — which makes the writer's language sufficient to his thought — is lexical: there are already expressions in the language to fit any thought.

The second — which makes the writer's language an image of his thought — is structural. Thought comes with a structure and a direction. Its structure is built upon skeletal images that underlie our everyday experience. We have a skeletal image, or image schema, of moving toward an object. We have an image schema of adding one thing to another. We have an image schema of a path that leads from a source to a goal. We have many image schemas, of hesitation and advance, of movement from a center to a periphery, of entering or leaving, of enclosing or extracting, of rising or falling, of stopping or penetrating. These image schemas are not exclusively visual. We have an image schema of a rising pitch, of increasing pressure, of a jab to the skin, and so on. Many of our most important and useful image schemas have to do with the way we structure space and interact with space. We use these spatial image schemas to make sense of abstract things that are not themselves spatial. We think of time as linear or circular. We think of solving a problem as「moving toward」a goal along a path. We think of the reasoning mind as a body moving in space, which「comes upon」ideas,「looks them over,」「picks them up」for examination,「drops」them to look「further afield,」and so on. A great deal of our reasoning consists of metaphoric projections of these bodily and spatial image schemas onto abstract concepts. We think of events, which have no shape, as having a shape: open ended or closed, discrete or continuous, cyclic or linear.

In the classic view, the prototype of truth is a thought that comes structured by one of these basic image schemas or some recognizable combination or extension of them.

But these same image schemas structure expression as well. Expressions are forms, and these forms can have image-schematic structure. A sentence, for example, can be thought of as linear, as moving, as approaching a point. A classic thought that has the image-schematic structure of moving along a path to stop sharply at an end for which the path exists will be mirrored in a sentence that has the image-schematic structure of moving along a path to stop smartly at an end for which the preceding part of the sentence exists. Here is an example from Clifford Geertz.「[I]f you want to understand what a science is, you should look in the first instance not at its theories or its findings, and certainly not at what its apologists say about it; you should look at what the practitioners of it do.」

It is possible for thought and language to be misaligned in one of three ways. First, you can write a sentence that cannot be grasped through any basic image schema. This is unusual, since most writers align their sentences with basic image schemas automatically and unconsciously. Occasionally, however, writers with an advanced knowledge of prose style become self-conscious and defensive about their own writing and begin to misalign sentences. The result is both difficult to read and impossible to correct by making local revisions. Here is an example:「The fact is that the subtlety and control which philologists were willing to attribute to earlier writers' spellings and word-groupings as registers of distinctive features in phonology and morphology by and large stopped there.」

Second, you can write a sentence that evokes an image schema but then fails to fulfill it or complete it. Suppose Geertz had written,「If you want to understand what a science is, you should look in the first instance not at its theories but you should instead, putting aside its findings, concentrate your attention on its practice entirely, taking care not to be distracted by anything its apologists might say about that.」The first half of this sentence, to the word「theories,」sets the reader to expect a crisp opposition. But the second half of the sentence frustrates the expectation.

Third, you can have a thought that is structured by an image schema but express it in a sentence structured by a different image schema. Suppose Geertz had written,「If you want to understand what a science is, and you look at its theories and its findings and its representations by apologists, you will find that you must set all this aside to look at what its practitioners do, which is where you should have directed your attention in the first instance.」The image schema of Geertz's original thought consists of rejecting several things in order to select a different one. The image schema of his original sentence is compatible with the image schema of his thought. But the revision of his sentence is structured by an image schema of attending to various things and then returning to the beginning to attend to something different. The image schema that structures the revised sentence is common, but it is incompatible with the image schema that structured the thought it was meant to mirror.

Perhaps the most common image schema used in structuring expression is movement along a directed path from a source to a goal. In this image schema, the end of the sentence seems to be the goal of the sentence, what it is trying to get to. In consequence, there is a phenomenon in English known as the stress position: whatever you put at the end of the sentence will be taken, absent direction to the contrary, to be the most important part of the sentence, as it is in Geertz's sentence:「you should look at what the practitioners of [the science] do.」

Classic style respects the stress position. La Rochefoucauld's classic sentence about Madame de Chevreuse — like Geertz's — puts the point of the thought at the end of the sentence:「and she almost always brought disaster to those she encountered on her way.」The end of the sentence seems to be the reason the sentence is written; everything leads to it; and the sentence stops confidently when it reaches that end because the image schema of both thought and expression is complete. The use of the stress position in classic style is often quite subtle, but the classic writer frequently plays on it, as in this description of the northern shrike:「Unusual among songbirds, shrikes prey on small birds and rodents, catching them with the bill and sometimes impaling them on thorns or barbed wire for storage.」Rearranging this sentence in any way diminishes it.

A common perceptual image schema is focusing-and-then-inspecting. First we locate the object or domain of interest, and then we inspect its details. This image schema is not restricted to visual perception; it operates equally well in tactile, auditory, and kinesthetic perception. Classic thought frequently follows this fundamental image schema, focusing on a subject and then inspecting its details, and classic expression of this thought shares the same image schema, first presenting the subject and then presenting details.

Many of the most familiar image schemas have to do with forces — impinging, pushing, pressuring, stopping, overcoming — especially when these forces are applied by agents in action. A classic thought is often structured by an image schema of action. Its classic expression mirrors this structure. The structure of the expression conforms to the structure of the action: the subject is an agent and the verb is the action performed by the agent.

Classic style is compelling often exactly because it exploits such common image schemas. Truth comes with basic image-schematic structure. We expect its expression to come with the same structure. Consequently, when a sentence has a clear image-schematic structure, it seems plausible that what the sentence expresses is true.

This is a psychological tactic of persuasion, founded upon our readiness to accept whatever has the same form as what we have already accepted. Consider roles, such as president, pope, professor, policeman. We accept new holders of these roles largely because they adopt an institutional form we have already accepted. The new president operates in known and accepted forms such as formal messages to Congress and press conferences in the Rose Garden. Presidential primaries are largely a test of who can best pick up the established forms. The new pope is accepted partly because he dresses in the same anachronistic fashion as the old pope, and uses the same ambiguous language of indirection. For centuries, visual representations of scholars have included a case of books in the background, and this form abides tenaciously even now, when scholarly work is as likely to involve brains in vats or electronic texts.

In the classic view, truth comes with a structure that we already know and accept. Adopting a new truth does not mean adopting a new form. In classic style, a new truth will be expressed in old words structured in a reassuringly familiar form.

The observation that expression mirrors thought by inheriting its image-schematic structure is both ancient and common in the history of rhetoric. Longinus views many rhetorical figures as linguistic instruments for achieving this alignment. For example, repeated physical striking has an image-schematic structure; it can be mirrored in expression through linguistic anaphora, as in:「By his manner, his looks, his voice, when he strikes you with insult, when he strikes you like an enemy, when he strikes you with his knuckles, when he strikes you like a slave.」Demetrius talks of linguistic constructions being「rounded,」「disjointed,」「hastening towards a definite goal as runners do when they leave the starting-place,」「circular,」「tense,」「periodic,」and so on. He remarks that thought comes with part-whole structure that can be mirrored in the linguistic construction, and that we experience syntactic constructions image-schematically:「Long journeys are shortened by a succession of inns, while desolate paths, even when the distances are short, give the impression of length. Precisely the same principle will apply also in the case of members [linguistic constructions].」

Classic style typically aligns the image schemas structuring thought and its expression, but in a fashion that escapes notice. There are other, contrasting styles that intend to raise this correspondence to the level of the remarkable, to show the skillful labor of the writer, as does Longinus's example of anaphora. The role of image schemas in the alignment of thought and language, once treated in ancient rhetoric, has resurfaced as a topic in contemporary philosophy, cognitive science, and linguistics.

1.4.5 思想和语言

思想可独立存在

在古典风格对风格元素的立场中，写作不是思考问题的工具，也不是为了写而写的纯粹艺术。写作只是把作者考虑成熟的东西呈现出来。它记录思想，仅限于把思想活动呈现为某种推理顺序。记录下来的文本不是一份包含个体思想过程的文件；也不是一份专门回应其他文本的文本；它是一种透明的媒介，用以呈现独立存在的现实。古典风格总是默认呈现有价值的事物。本质上，这种默认的价值有两重含义：呈现的事物很重要；可以独立理解而非某物的一部分。能被独立理解的思想通常基于共同经验，这种经验经过提炼后变得清晰。古典写作从来都不是某种思想的「注解」，进一步发展才有可能独立存在；也不是某个系统调查的第五部分，必须先了解前面四部分才能看懂后面。

古典表达的魅力无法在阅读之前展现出来，它把读者的高度关注假定为自己的权利。要使这种假定名副其实，它讲述的东西必须重要、完整、独立且容易理解。比如笛卡儿的《谈谈方法》，历史上是对蒙田的怀疑论的回应。但书中从未提及蒙田。笛卡儿的思想，是以独立的故事讲述作者的个人经验，而不是重新验证充满了交叉参照的哲学历史的哲学问题。这种引述式呈现只会向非专业人士暗示这本书不能单独阅读。从笛卡儿及许多其他古典风格作者的风格中可以看出，非博学不能通的内容，非专才通才不能理解的东西，基本都不重要。古典表达是否重要和能否理解，不在于有多少专业知识，而在于读者能否清晰、专注地思考。作者和读者墨守的约定是：作者应提供有价值且独立完整的内容，以回馈读者的高度关注与敏锐思考。古典表达可比作巴赫变奏曲，与众不同，干净利落，从起初划破沉寂到最后回归沉寂，不留任何悬而未决的东西。

华菜士·斯蒂文斯（Wallace Stevens）有一首诗叫《一首诗取代了一座高山》（The Poem That Took the Place of the Mountain）。这首诗写出来之前。这座山就已经存在，且独立于这首诗存在。对于地质学家来说，一座山本身很难理解，因为它是地球自然史中的事件，但它可见可指称，而且在大众经验中是一个独立、清晰又醒目的物体。要独立理解这首诗，可能需要先理解某个复杂网络中的概念和规约，但是因为这些在本诗所属的文化中已广为人知，所以可以认为这首诗能被独立理解。如果我们认同一首诗可以「逐字逐句地」取代一座山，我们也可以以此类此古典风格：在一个清晰且容易理解的框架之中，写作可以经由一个个细节呈现思想。

抽象可清晰准确

站在古典风格的立场看，用抽象和具体区分事物没有意义。有些写作讲师或顾问可能建议写作要具体、避免抽象，这种建议肤浅且不实用，因为把二者的区别想得太简单了。问题不在于事物的本体论归属，而在于构思事物的风格。

在浪漫风格中，作者能把一棵树看成好像只有他才能看到它本来的样子。这样的一棵树无法独立于作者而存在；它取决于作者；若是把它看成清晰具体的东西，就会抹灭作者灵光一现的洞见，这种洞见脆弱又难以捉摸，无法用语言描述。在浪漫风格中，作者与读者不是对等关系。树本身具体可见，但不影响浪漫作者用一种其他人无法观察的方式设想，就像他想象人类灵魂一样模糊不定。

古典风格与之相反，人类灵魂可以想得像你眼前的树一样清晰具体。古典风格作者呈现的抽象事物 —— 文化现实、英雄主义、历史因果、再现性的本质、味道 —— 独立于作者存在，各个层次的细节巨细无遗，任何有能力的人站在合适位置都会看到，很容易辨认，而且可以用简单直接的语言表达。

并不是抽象本身不好、模糊或不明确。只是用了某些风格思考时才这样。古典风格作者谈论抽象事物时，如果我们不刻意提醒自己，还以为他说的是一块石头、一片树叶、一座雕像。无论具体的钻石还是它的艺术美学，古典风格作者的呈现就好像两者都是清晰具体的有形事物。

思想先于表达

古典风格认为，写作不是思考。与之相反的是一个广为人知的观点：写作与大脑是一组密切相关的概念。记录被看成一种外在记忆，记忆被看成一种内在记录。写作是纸上的思考，思想是大脑的写作。作者的大脑相当于一张不会写完的纸，作者写在上面，把思想变成内在写作；他写的书是外在的思想，是大脑写作的外在形式。作者是正在思考的自我，自我是进行大脑写作的作者。（哈姆雷特说，「在我头脑的书卷之中。」）有时候，自我是将他的思考过程记于纸上的作者。

古典风格的态度完全不同。因为它是一种呈现型风格，至少是先有思考然后写出来。它形成的想法，就是写作的动机。古典风格作者的这种思考，考虑到他是作者，仅限于呈现的战略型思考，而且不太清晰。

思考不是写作；更重要的是，写作不是思考。不是说古典风格在开始写之前就要把所有问题都想好，而是古典风格作者不会边想边写，也不会以写代替思考。作者只用在一句话结束后、另一句话开始前闪现完美的思想。刚想好要表达什么，句子随之写出来。对古典风格作者而言，思考于写作就如烹饪于上菜，是完全不同的东西。每家正规餐馆都有一间用于准备食物的厨房，和一间用于呈上食物的餐厅。无论厨房里多么忙乱，餐厅总是一片安静祥和，呈现的菜品让人觉得，完美是一项轻而易举的普通工作。厨房和餐厅之间自然是密切相关、频繁往来，但一家正规餐馆的规范之一就是，当它们在不同的星球上。厨师不会坐在餐厅休息，客人不会去厨房参观。

看见不等同于呈现。我们只能呈现我们看见并认出来的东西。在古典风格中，思考是观看，或者更广泛地讲，思考是辨认；写作是呈现作者所见，让读者也能看到。古典风格作者似乎尽力把东西放在你眼前，或者尽力让你站在他的位置上，这样你就能看到他看到的。

语言足以表达

有些写作风格表示，语言不足以表达时再也没有别的方式可以表达，所以作者只不过是尽其所能让语言贴近思想。古典风格的立场怡恰相反。对特定思想的表达不仅有好有坏，而且有最优表达。凡是可知的事物就能被人们表达出来。而且，每种思想都有完美的表达，就像初等代数中每个问题都有完美的求解。

几年前，《华尔街日报》刊登了一篇短文，讲述某法国政府机构和一群法国研究科学家之间的争议。这些科学家准备用英语发表一篇报告；该政府机构对此表示反对，反对理由看起来很充分：这些科学研究是法国科学家的成果，而且由法国政府支持，应该用法语发表。科学家们反驳道，英语已经成为科学领域大多数场合的国际通用语言，如果科学家希望他们的科研报告被阅读，只能用英语发表。有句话总结了这种观点：「回避英语就是自行隔离」（To shun English is to court isolation）。13

这句话共七个单词，思想与表达之间有一种简练的对称和契合，这是一种不会妥协也绝非近似的完美，一旦达到，看起来就会自然而然、轻而易举。这像打高尔夫球时挥杆的力度刚够进球。古典风格的规约是每种思想都有完美的表达；作者可能没找到契合思想的语言，但这只是作者水准欠佳，而不是作者用的材料不行。

当我们谈论某物的「表述方式」时，意味着有多种方式表达同一种想法，每种表达各有优势，但不可避免也有局限。每种具体的表述方式只是其中一种，肯定有不完整和不充分的地方。因此一种思想选用任何一组特定词句表达，都要付出妥协的代价。

古典立场的基础规约与之相反：语言足以表达任何想法。表达不完美是作者水平有限，而不是语言有限。不是说只有古典风格作者精通语言，许多其他风格的作者显然也精通语言。古典风格作者秉持的另一条规约是，他掌握的语言足以表达任何思想。古典风格作者不能表达得很费力，给读者一种语言无法胜任表达的感觉。古典风格作者不会用语言暗示他无法确切说明的真相。暗示性语言是没有完美运用语言的表现。古典风格不会用俗语、新造词、遁词和俚语，因为不需要用到它们：没有它们，语言也足够表达。表达新的想法不需要用新的语言。

古典语言可贴合古典思想

古典风格中，思想和语言的契合表现为两个层面。第一种是词汇上的契合，作者的语言足够表达他的思想，因为语言中已经存在适合任何想法的表达。

第二种是结构上的契合，结构使作者的语言成为反映思想的意象。思想有它的结构和方向。它的结构基于我们日常经历的基本意象。临近某个物体是一种基本意象，或者说意象图式（image schema）。往某物上添加东西是一种意象图式。一条从起点到终点的路径是一种意象图式。还有很多意象图式：踌躇和前进、从中心到两边、进入或离开、包围或提取、上升或下降、停止或蔓延。这些意象图式并非只有视觉意象，还有音调上升、压力增加、扎刺皮肤等意象。许多最重要、最有用的意象图式与我们的空间构建方式和空间交互方式有关。这些空间意象图式可以帮助我们理解本身不是空间结构的抽象事物。我们把时间理解成线状或环状。我们认为解决问题是沿着某条路径「达到」（moving toward）目标。我们把推理的大脑看作空间中移动的身体，「发现」（comes upon）想法，「朝上看」（looks them over）「举起来「(picks them up），「放下」（drops）它们「往远」（further afield）看，等等。我们很多的推理判断都是用这些人体及空间意象图式比拟抽象的概念。事件本没有形状，但我们把它理解成某种形状：开放式或封闭式，离散型或连续型，周期性或线性。

古典风格认为，真相的原型依存的思想结构是这些基本意象图式，也可以是相互组合或延伸后新组的可识别形式。

但是这些相同的意象图式也能构建表达。不同表达即不同形式，而这些形式具备意象图式的结构。比如，一个句子可以看作线型、前进、正靠近某个点。如果某种古典思想的意象图式结构是沿着一条路径向前移动，在这条路径为之存在的终点突然结束，这种意象图式结构表现在句子中仍是沿着一条路径向前移动，在句子前面部分为之存在的末尾利落结束。比如克利福德·格尔茨（Clifford Geertz）这个例子：「假如你想了解什么是科学，首先要做的不是看它的理论或成果，当然也不是看它的辩护者说了什么；你应该看看它的从业者在做什么。」4

思想和语言不一致，有三种可能。

第一，你写的句子无法用任何基本意象图式来理解。这很少见，因为大多数作者会不自觉地用基本意象图式调整他们的句子。但有时候，作者学习了文章风格的进阶知识后，对他们自己的写作会带有自我意识和防卫心理，导致句子偏离基本意象图式。结果，写出来的东西不仅很难读下去，也无法通过局部修订来调整。以这句话为例：「事实是，这种微妙和克制 —— 语言学家愿意归因于早期作家在拼写和词组上选择了有鲜明的音韵和词法特征的语体风格 —— 大体上自那之后就没有了。」15

第二，你写的句子唤起了某个意象图式，但没有履行或完成它。假设格尔茨这样写：「假如你想了解什么是科学，首先要做的不是看它的理论，而是应该先把它的成果放一边，把注意力全部放在它的实践上，注意不要被它的辩护者说的任何话干扰。」这句话的前半部分说到「理论」这个词，引起读者预期与之截然相反的东西。但句子的后半部分却没有回应这种预期。

第三，你用了某种意象图式构建你的想法，但表达成句子时用的是另一种不同的意象图式。假设格尔茨这样写：「如果你想了解什么是科学，并看了它的理论和成果及它的辩护者说了什么，你会发现必须把所有这些放到一边，看看它的从业者在做什么，这是你一开始就应关注的地方。」格尔茨原本的思想的意象图式是依次拒绝若干东西，选出一项不同的东西。他本人的句子的意象图式，与他的思想的意象图式相吻合。修改后的句子的意象图式是先做几件事，再回到开头做不同的事情。改后的句子的意象图式很常见，但不符合它要反映的思想的意象图式。

也许构建表达最常用的意象图式是，沿着一条路前进，从起点直到终点。在这种意象图式中，句子的结尾似乎是句子的目标，它努力要抵达的地方。因此，英语中有一种现象叫焦点位置：无论你在句子结尾放什么内容（除非句子的方向是反的），都会被当作句子最重要的部分，就像格尔茨的句子结尾是：「你应该看看（科学）从业者在做什么。」

古典风格遵行焦点位置。拉罗什福科描述谢弗勒兹夫人的古典句子 —— 与格尔茨一样 —— 将思想要点放在句末：「她几乎总是给那些她碰到的人带来灾难。」句子的结尾似乎是作者写出这句话的原因；每件事情都指向这个结尾；句子来到末尾时干脆地结束了，因为思想和表达这两者的意象图式都已完成。焦点位置在古典风格中通常用得相当微妙，但古典风格作者经常利用这一点，比如这句描述灰伯劳的话：「与大多数鸣禽不同，伯劳鸟捕食小型鸟类和啮齿类动物，用喙捕捉到它们后，有时还把它们穿在荆棘或铁丝网上储存起来」。用任何方式重组这句话，都比不上原来的表达。

常见的知觉意象图式是先关注后观察（focusing-and-then-inspecting）。

首先我们找到感兴趣的事物或领域，然后观察它的细节。这种意象图式不局限于视觉；触觉、听觉和动觉也同样适用。古典思想经常引用这种基本意象图式，关注某个主题，然后观察它的细节。表达这种思想的古典句子遵循同样的意象图式，先呈现主题，然后呈现细节。

许多最常见的意象图式都与力量有关 —— 撞击、推动、施压、停止或压倒 —— 尤其当主体通过行动施加这些力量时。古典思想常用行动意象图式构建。它这种结构会反映在相应的古典句子中。表达的结构跟行动的结构一致：主语是行为主体，而动词是行为主体实施的行动。

古典风格容易令人信服，恰恰是因为它利用了这些常见的意象图式。真相有基本的意象图式结构。我们期望它的表达具有相同的结构。因此，当句子表现出清晰的意象图式结构时，更容易让人相信句子表达的是真相。

这是一种说服式的，心理策略，当我们已经接受什么后，我们很容易接受任何与之相同的形式。想想总统、教授和警察这类角色。我们接受这些角色的新上任者，很大程度上是因为他们采用了我们已经熟悉的体制形式。新总统遵循的是公众已熟悉和认可的做法，如向国会发布正式信息，在玫瑰园举行新闻发布会。总统大选初选主要考验谁最可能沿袭既定做法。几个世纪以来，我们看到学者出现的背景都是一排排书籍，这种做法一直沿袭至今，尽管学术工作很可能只是涉及缸中之脑类的脑力工作或电子文本。

古典风格认为，真相以一种我们熟知的结构为我们所接受。接受新的真相，并不意味着要接受新的形式。在古典风格中，用已有的词汇表达、用熟悉易理解的形式构建新的真相。

表达能反映思想是因为沿袭了思想的意象图式结构，这是修辞史上早就有的普遍观点。朗吉弩斯（Longinus）把修辞手法看作实现这种匹配的语言工具。例如，重复的物理打击是一种意象图式结构。这种重复在语言表达中表现为首语重复，比如：「当他用辱骂打击你，当他像敌人一样打击你，当他用他的指关节打击你，当他像对待奴隶一样打击你，他的态度、他的神色、他的声音无不在实施打击。」（By his manner,, hiS looks, his voce, when he strikes youith nutwhen he strikes you like anmy, when he strikes you with his knuckles, when he strikes you like a slave.）16

德米特里（Demetrus）说语言结构是「完整的」「不连贯的」「像跑步运动员一样从起点冲向终点」「循环往复的」「紧绷的」「周期性的」等 17。他说思想的「部分整体」结构会反映在语言结构上，而我们以意象图式感受句法结构：「长途旅行因为有一个又一个旅馆而使人不觉得漫长，而荒凉的短途，距离虽短，却让人觉得漫长。同样的原则刚好也适用于语言结构。」18

古典风格通常用意象图式结构校正思想和表达是否一致，但用的是一种读者不易察觉的方式。有些风格截然不同，会有意彰显这种对应关系，以显示作者的用心和才能，如朗吉弩斯首语重复的例子。意象图式在匹配语言和思想方面的作用，早在古代修辞中就讨论过，如今又重新成为哲学、认知科学和语言学探讨的话题。

### 1.5 Other Stands, Other Styles

There is nothing new in the idea that a style is effectively a stand on a small number of central issues, and therefore that many different mature styles are possible. Classical rhetoricians analyzed contrasting styles from this perspective, and routinely demonstrated that what was good or appropriate to one style might be bad or inappropriate to another. By contrast, many modern books on「style」have, for one reason or another, suggested that there are only two styles: good and bad. On closer inspection, it becomes apparent that each of these modern books is actually about one style, not about style generally. For example, Strunk and White or Williams and Colomb work from an implicit model of writing as meant to be read by either (a) an indefinite audience not defined by working roles but having more-or-less common cultural and social standards; or (b) a somewhat more definite audience of working professionals with corporately defined roles. What Strunk and White recommend is meant as good advice for the one style they have in mind; what Williams and Colomb recommend is good advice for the one style they have in mind. Both assume a single cast and a single scene. But consider texts with quite a different cast or scene, such as a diplomatic address opening peace negotiations in the Middle East, or Pericles' Funeral Oration, or Samuel Johnson's「Preface to Shakespeare,」or an address by Martin Luther King, Jr., to a large crowd of political activists. Were we to subject texts of this sort to editorial revision inspired by a careful study of Williams and Colomb or Strunk and White, the result would be simply the destruction of a style. These writers and speakers certainly break many of the「rules」to be found in Style and The Elements of Style, but that is because the styles discussed in those books are foreign to the styles chosen. It is unreasonable to expect that addressing a giant rally in Washington and writing a memo to the vice president for finance on the consequences of the new tax code should have lying behind them the same stylistic stand, or that either one of them should have the same stylistic stand as an article for The New Yorker or Johnson's explanation of Shakespeare's claim to our attention.

Classical textbooks such as Cicero's Orator, the pseudo-ciceronian Rhetorica ad Herennium, and Demetrius's On Style list principal styles and explain their origins in different purposes, motives, or occasions. The standard list includes high, middle, and low style, otherwise called grand, middle, and simple. Demetrius gives instruction in restrained, elevated, elegant, and forcible style. Aristotle in the Rhetoric notes in passing that each kind of rhetoric has its own appropriate style: for example, the style of political speech cannot be the style of forensic speech because their originary purposes, scenes, and casts are opposed.

Classical rhetoricians routinely analyze the relationships between distinct styles. Elegant style, Demetrius explains, can unite with restrained style, but elevated style cannot, because elevated style and restrained style「stand in irreconcilable opposition and contrast」: their fundamental decisions are consistently incompatible.

Certain failures to achieve a successful style are so predictable and common as to constitute styles of their own, which might be called styles that do not succeed. The Rhetorica ad Herennium explains how swollen style, slack style, and meager style arise as particular kinds of failure to achieve grand, middle, or simple style, suggesting that each good style has at least one deformed double. Longinus introduces us to two deformed versions of sublime style, each of which is a product of a particular kind of failure to achieve it. Bloated style「comes from trying to outdo the sublime.」Adolescent style comes from puerility,「the opposite of greatness: abject, mean, smarmy, the lowest of faults. What is this puerility? Isn't it just obviously the academic attitude, where over-elaboration ends in frigid failure? Writers fall into this fault because they want to be uncommon and exquisite, and to impress everybody, and instead they founder upon the trash of affectation.」Such failures all come「from the same cause, namely, today's crazy passion for novel ideas.」

Surface marks of writing reflect the fundamental stands of individual styles, but surface marks do not constitute styles, and styles do not prescribe surface marks, even though styles can explain such marks. To Aristotle, excellence of style consists in being clear and not commonplace — this is a fundamental stand on the question of presentation. He then examines surface techniques that can help the writer to achieve clarity and distinction, and alerts us to typical errors at the surface level. Aristotle offers many examples, but the discussion of the surface in every case derives from an analysis of the base. Longinus does the same thing, walking us through a great range of surface marks appropriate to sublime style, and contrasting successful examples of the style with failed attempts, but he does not suggest that the style derives from surface marks appropriate to it.

The many such examples in classical rhetorical treatments, and the use of repeated examples as patterns on which students can model their own writing, should never be interpreted as suggesting that style consists of surface marks, or that if we imitate the surface marks, we achieve the style. This would be as foolish as imagining that by wearing the same kind of shoes as a great athlete and imitating the athlete's manner of tying the laces, we will become great athletes ourselves. Both Aristotle and Longinus recognize that without the fundamental stand, the surface marks form only a sorry and monstrous parody of the style. Neither of them would have endorsed the procedure of selecting one sentence for inspection and posing the question,「What is the style of this sentence?」For example, the sentence,「He died quietly」could occur with perfect appropriateness in a work whose style is plain, classic, romantic, contemplative, oratorical, sublime, prophetic, practical, or diplomatic. To recognize a style, one must recognize its fundamental stand on decisive questions, which will be reflected with greater or lesser skill in its level of expression.

The closest model in classical antiquity for our analysis of classic style is Longinus's analysis of「the sublime」in On the Sublime, perhaps the most brilliant treatment of a style ever written.

No reader can think that Longinus is trying to give a universal prescription for good writing; he analyzes the distinctive stand of one style, and is always aware that there are many others. Sublime style is distinct from other styles because it takes a distinct stand on the elements of style: truth, presentation, scene, cast, thought and language. Its cast, unlike the cast of classic style, does not involve a symmetric relationship between equals; its model scene is not conversation; the relationship of language to thought does not have the effect of either presentation or persuasion.「For the effect of genius is not to persuade the audience but rather to transport them out of themselves.」Sublime writing, or writing at moments when it achieves the style of sublimity, consequently has a character entirely different from that of writing whose purpose is to persuade through detailed and systematic argument, for in linear argument,「inventive skill and the due disposal and marshalling of facts gradually emerge from the whole tissue of the composition, rather than showing themselves in one or two touches: on the other hand, a well-timed flash of sublimity scatters everything before it like a bolt of lightning and reveals the full power of the speaker at a single stroke.」

Longinus situates the origin of sublime style fundamentally at the level of thought, not surface constructions: the prime and most powerful source of the sublime is「the command of full-blooded ideas.」A natural faculty of expression is of course indispensable to sublime style, but cannot provide sublime style. Longinus's view of the source of sublime style depends upon a view of the relationship between writer and reader as fundamentally asymmetric: the writer is gifted with a fabulous mind and a natural talent for expression, which we admire, and the effect of which is to transport us out of ourselves in ways that otherwise are probably not available to us.

Yet for all the asymmetry between writers of the sublime and students of this writing, Longinus offers students a curriculum that might help them cultivate a capacity for the sublime. This curriculum consists not in mastering and parroting certain surface patterns, but rather in training the mind:

Now, since the first, I mean natural genius, plays a greater part than all the others, here too, although it is rather a gift than an acquired quality, we should still do our best to train our minds into sympathy with what is noble and impregnate them again and again with high inspiration.「How?」you might ask. Well, elsewhere I have written something like this,「Sublimity is the true ring of a noble mind.」And so even without being spoken the bare idea often by itself wins admiration for its inherent genius. . . . In the first place, then, it is absolutely necessary to indicate the sources of the sublime and to show that the mind of the genuine orator must be neither small nor ignoble. For it is impossible that those whose thoughts and habits all their lives long are petty and servile should flash out anything wonderful, worthy of immortal life. No, a great style is the natural outcome of important thoughts, and sublime expressions naturally fall to people with spirit.

In the spirit of Longinus, we would like now to clarify the stand of classic style on the elements of style and to contrast classic style with a selection of other mature and consistent styles.

一种风格，其实是对几个核心问题的一组立场，因此可能存在多种不同的成熟风格，这不是什么新观点。在这点上，古典修辞学家早就分析了对比鲜明的风格，意料之中的结论是，对某种风格有益或适宜的，可能对别的风格无益或不适宜。相反，许多现代书谈论「风格」，由于这样或那样的原因，认为风格只分好风格和坏风格两种。进一步考察，很明显这些书每本只谈到某种风格，而不是从总体上谈论风格。

比如，斯特伦克和怀特的《风格的要素》、威廉斯和科伦的《风格》，他们默认的写作模式面向两类读者：一类是不确定的读者，没有统一的职业角色，但或多或少有共同的文化和社会标准；另一类是比较确定的读者，一般是专业工作人员，有确定的职业角色。斯特伦克和怀特是针对他们心中的风格提出好建议；威廉斯和科伦则为他们心中的风格提出好建议。两种风格都只针对单一角色和单一场景。但想想角色和场景与之相异的文本，比如，启动中东和平谈判的外交致辞，或伯里克利的葬礼悼词，或塞缪尔·约翰逊的《莎士比亚戏剧集序言》，或马丁·路德·金面向一大群政治积极分子的演讲。如果让这类文本按照斯特伦克和怀特或者是威廉斯和科伦的建议编辑修订，只会破坏原本的风格。这些作者和演讲者当然违反了《风格》和《风格的要素》里提到的诸多规则，但那是因为他们用的风格不同于这些书讨论的风格。在一场盛大的华盛顿集会上发表演讲和就新税法的影响向财政部副部长写备忘录，是两种不同风格，不应认为它们是一样的风格立场，也不应把它们的任一立场等同于某篇《纽约客》的文章或约翰逊论述莎剧如何吸引观众的立场。

古典风格教材，比如西塞罗（Cicero）的《论演说家》（Orator）、托名为西塞罗所作的《献给赫伦尼厄斯的修辞学》（Rhetorica ad Herennium）和德米特里的《论风格》（On Style），列出了主要的风格类型，并从不同目的、动机或场合解释了它们的起源。标准的分类包括高等（high）、中等（middle）、低等（low）风格，亦称作宏大（grand）、中和（middle）和简朴（simple）风格。德米特里教授了矜持（restrained）、庄严（elevated）、优雅（elegant）和雄劲（forcible）风格。亚里士多德（Aristotle）在《修辞学》（Rhetoric）1 里提及每种修辞都有它适宜的风格，比如政治讲话的风格不可能是法庭讲话的风格，因为它们本身的目的、场景和角色截然不同。

古典修辞学家照例分析了不同风格间的关系。德米特里解释道，优雅风格可与矜持风格结合，但庄严风格不能，因为庄严风格和矜持风格「相互矛盾、不可共存」2，它们的立场始终无法兼容。

不足为怪的是，有些奔着好风格出发却因力不胜任而自成风格的，可能被称为坏风格。《献给赫伦尼厄斯的修辞学》解释了浮华 (swollen）、人松垮（(slack）和简硒（meager）风格分别是宏大、中和与简朴风格的某种次品，可见每种好风格至少对应一种坏风格。朗吉督斯向我们介绍了崇高（sublime）风格对应的两种坏风格，两者都是仿而未达的次品。浮夸（bloated）风格「是由于想超过崇高」3。幼雅（Adolescent）风格是因为天真，即「雄浑的反面；琐屑无聊，心胸狭窄，是最可鄙的弊病。幼稚究竟是什么呢？它可不显然是一种书呆子气，因为过于雕琢，而陷入想入非非的败笔吗？作家之所以陷于这种通病，是由于追求精致、巧妙，尤其是追求风趣，于是滚入琐屑无聊的泥潭中」。这些失败都是「同根生的，皆出自标新立异思想，这种思想已经成为时下流行的狂热了」4。

文章的表面特征能反映某种风格的基本立场，但表面特征不能构成风格，风格也没有规定哪些表面特征，尽管风格可以解释这些特征。亚里士多德认为，优秀的风格在于清晰且不落俗套 —— 这是呈现的基本立场。他分析了可以帮作者写得清晰鲜明的表面技巧，并提醒我们不要犯流于表面的通病。

亚里士多德举了许多例子，但每个案例的表面特征都是基于基本立场的分析。朗吉弩斯做了同样的事情，向我们逐一解释崇高风格表现出来的各种表面技巧，并对比了好风格与坏风格，但他并不认为风格源于对应的表面特征。5

汉译文选自缪灵珠译本《堡灵珠美学译文集》（第一卷）「论崇高」，本书其他「论崇高」选段均出自该翻译版本。—— 译者注

在古典修辞论述中有许多诸如此类的例子，而且一些经典句式被用作学生仿写的范例，但这不能看作风格由表面特征构成。或只要模仿表面特征就能写成这样的风格。这种想法太天真，就像以为穿上伟大运动员的同款鞋子，学他们系鞋带的方式，我们就能成为伟大的运动员一样。亚里士多德和朗吉弩斯都认为：没有基本立场，表面特征只是风格的一种拙劣、可怕的滑稽模仿。他们谁都不会认同单看某句话就判断「这句话是什么风格？」比如，「他安静地死了」这句话，可以完美适用平实风格、古典风格、浪漫风格、沉思风格、演说风格、崇高风格、先知风格、实用风格或外交风格。要辨识一种风格，必须要辨识它在决定性问题上采取的基本立场，这种立场表现在表达技巧上，有可能卓越，也有可能拙劣。

古典时期，最接近我们分析的古典风格的风格模型是，朗吉弩斯在《论崇高》中分析的「崇高风格」，它或许是书面记载的最精彩的风格论述。

读者很难想到，朗吉弩斯在尝试为好文章下一种普适的规定；他分析一种风格的鲜明立场，又总能意识到很多其他风格的存在。崇高风格不同于别的风格，因为它对真相、呈现、场景、角色、思想和语言这些风格要素采取了鲜明立场。它的角色，不像古典风格的角色，不是平等个体之间的对等关系；它的典型场景不是对话；语言于思想的关系既不是为了呈现，也不是为了说服。「天才不仅在于能说服听众，且亦在于使人心荡神驰。」6 崇高的文章，或者在特定时刻表现出崇高风格的文章，与通过详细系统的论证达到说服目的的文章完全不同，因为在线性论证中，「独运匠心，善于章法，精于剪栽，不是在一两处可以觉察的，而须在全篇的发展中逐渐表现出来。但是一个崇高的思想，在恰到好处时出现，便宛若电光一闪，照彻长空，显出雄辩家的全部威力。」7

朗吉弩斯认为崇高风格的本质源于思想层面而非表面特征：「能形成令人振奋的思想」8 是崇高风格最首要、最有力的源泉。天然的表达能力当然是崇高风格必需的，但还不足以实现崇高风格。朗吉驾斯眼中的崇高风格源于作者与读者之间的完全不对等关系：作者天资聪颖，生来能说会道，令人羡慕，它的效果就是为了让我们心荡神驰，如果不用这种方式，我们可能领略不到。

尽管崇高风格作者和这种风格的学生之间的关系多么不对等，朗吉弩斯还是为学生提供了一种可能的课程，帮他们培养写出崇高风格的能力。该课程不是为了掌握或模仿某些表面模式，而是为了训练思想：

第一个因素，我指崇高的天赋，较其余的因素更为重要。虽然这是天生而非学来的能力，我们也要努力陶冶我们的性情，使之达到高远的意境，使之孕育着高尚的灵感。你问我，这有什么方法呢？我在别处写过这句话：「崇高的风格是一颗伟大心灵的回声。」所以，一个朴实无华的思想，即使不发于言，也往往仅凭它本身固有的崇高精神而使人赞叹… 所以，首先指出崇高的来源是绝对必要的，我们说，一个真正的演讲家绝不应有卑鄙龌龈的心灵。因为，一个终生墨守着狭隘的、奴从的思想和习惯的人，绝不可能说出令人击节称赞的、永垂不朽的言辞。是的，雄伟的风格是重大的思想之自然结果，崇高的谈吐往往出自胸襟旷达、志向远大的人。9

本着朗吉弩斯的精神，我们接下来会阐明古典风格在风格要素上采取的立场，并选取其他成熟一致的风格与古典风格对比分析。

#### 1.5.1 Classic Style Is Not Plain Style

Plain style is communal, its model scene a congregation in which speakers reaffirm for each other common truths that are the property of all. In the theology behind plain style, truth is always simple, and it is a common human possession. Individual revisions of this communal possession distort and dilute it. The wisdom of children can be the wisdom of adults, because knowing truth requires no special experience and no critical analysis. Sophisticated thought and conceptual refinement pervert truth. Any language that reaches beyond the simplest level is suspicious as the probable symptom of such a perversion. Simple language may not always be completely adequate to the expression of truth, but at least it is pure as far as it goes.

Classic style does not reject plain style, although it rejects the theology behind it and sees that theology as illegitimately elevating a necessary foundation into an achieved style. From the perspective of classic style, plain style is deficient because the theology behind plain style ignores the fact that, left to themselves, people are vulnerable to special interests and prone to special pleading. People are weak, and common wisdom is thus often self-serving. It is perfectly possible for common wisdom to be an anthology of a community's complacent errors, because common wisdom does not include any principle of critical validation. Without critical testing, common wisdom becomes received opinion.

Classic style views itself as repairing the deficiency of plain style by introducing sophistication and individual responsibility. First, classic writers and readers are an elite community, consisting of those who practice the critical discipline of its theology. Anyone can take up this practice and so join, but the style is aristocratic, not egalitarian. Second, classic wisdom cannot be the wisdom of children because it depends upon a wealth of adult experience. In plain style, everyone is equal; truth is everyone's birthright. It is seen by all; it is everyone's possession. It can come out of the mouths of babes. In classic style, truth is available to all who are willing to work to achieve it, but truth is certainly not commonly possessed by all and is no one's birthright. In the classic view, truth is the possession of individuals who have validated common wisdom; for them, truth has been achieved, and such achievement requires both experience and a critical intelligence beyond the range of babes.

Classic style remedies the deficiency of plain style by requiring the writer to stand entirely behind the thought she presents. Freshness is mandatory in classic style but freshness has nothing to do with novelty of ideas, on which classic style places no special premium. It is rather the requirement that the thinking behind the writing be the achievement of an individual. The classic writer has done the thinking, personally. Even when she accepts or uses a commonplace, she has thought it through herself and can stand behind it herself.

Classic style contains plain style concretely by incorporating it, but also by extending it, the way a Chinese ideogram contains a radical. A classic sentence is often a nuanced version of a sentence that otherwise might have been plain.「Grace is simple」is plain.「Grace, from the perspective of God, is simple」is classic, as is「The machinery of grace is always simple.」Plain style values simplicity but shuns nuance. Classic style values both simplicity and nuance.「The truth is pure and simple」is plain.「The truth is rarely pure, and never simple」is classic.「Seeing is believing」is plain.「Seeing is believing only if you don't see too clearly」is classic.

1.5.1 古典风格不是平实风格

平实风格是一种集体风格，它的典型场景是教堂会众彼此重申着人人共享的真相。平实风格背后的信仰认为，真相永远简单，是人类的公共财产。这种集体真相经过个体修改，只会被歪曲和削弱。小孩的智慧可以是大人的智慧，因为知道真相不需要特别经验，不需要批判性分析。复杂思考和概念提炼只会歪曲真相。凡不是最简单的语言，都可能被怀疑是这种歪曲的征兆。简单语言也许无法总是完全表达真相，但至少就其本身而言足够纯粹。

古典风格并不排斥平实风格，尽管它排斥平实风格背后的信仰，认为那种信仰把必要的风格基础误当作完善的风格。从古典风格的视角来看，平实风格存在缺陷，因为它背后的信仰忽视了一个事实：没有约束的人容易受特殊利益和一己私利迷惑。人是软弱的，因此群体智慧常常为己谋利。群体智慧很有可能只是一群人自以为是的错误集锦，因为群体智慧缺乏任何批判性验证原则。群体智慧还没有经过批判性检验就成了公认的观点。

古典风格用深思熟虑和个体责任补足了平实风格的缺陷。首先，古典风格的作者和读者是一个精英群体，他们的信仰要求他们批判性分析。任何人只要奉守这种信仰，都可以成为其中一员，但古典风格是贵族风格，而非平民风格。其次，古典智慧不可能只限于小孩智慧，因为它依靠丰富的成人经验。在平实风格中，人人平等；真相是每个人与生俱来的权利。每个人都能看到它；每个人都能拥有它。它可以从婴儿的口中说出来。在古典风格中，每一个愿意为真相努力的人都能获取真相，但真相肯定不是人人共享，也不是生来的权利。古典风格认为，真相属于检验过集体智慧的个人；对他们来说，付出努力才能获得真相，这种努力需要的经验和批判性头脑非婴儿能及。

为改进平实风格的缺陷，古典风格要求作者能充分佐证他呈现的思想。新颖是古典风格的强制要求，但新颖不是想法创新，古典风格不关注创新。它要求写作背后的想法是个体思考的结果，由古典风格作者自己独立思考得出。尽管他采纳或沿用了一个寻常观点，但他自己充分思考过，能亲自佐证它。

古典风格与平实风格有实际的包含关系，平实风格是古典风格的一部分，古典风格是平实风格的延伸，就像汉字包含某个偏旁部首。一个可能是平实风格的句子，稍做改动就可以成为古典风格。「优雅就是简单」是平实风格。「在上帝眼里，优雅就是简单」是古典风格，如「优雅的机制总是很简单」10 一样。平实风格注重简单，但忽视了细微变化。古典风格简单亦不失微妙。「真相纯粹且简单」是平实风格。「真相很少纯粹，也决不简单」是古典风格。「眼见为实」是平实风格。「眼见不一定为实，小心双眼被蒙蔽」是古典风格。

#### 1.5.2 Classic Style Is Not Reflexive Style

In the classic stand on presentation, writing is a perfectly transparent window through which a subject is presented; the ability of the writer and the sufficiency of the language to serve this presentation are never in doubt.

This fundamental stand opposes classic style irreconcilably to an entire family of styles in which the writing itself shares a focus with any other possible subject, and the difficulties of the writing are brought to the reader's attention.

Classic writing can present anything, but even when the subject presented is writing itself, the focus is not shared. La Bruyère talks about the conditions of good writing when he says,「It is necessary to express what is true in order to write naturally, powerfully, sensitively,」but he does not call attention to his own writing as he is doing so. When Alexander Pope criticizes bad verse in An Essay on Criticism, the writing itself imitates the faults he discusses, becoming a focus of the reader's attention:「And ten low Words oft creep in one dull Line.」Classic style is a performance style, and while classic writers can be skeptical about anything else, they cannot be skeptical about their own ability to perform when they are in the act of performing. The classic writer assumes that his subject can be known and can be expressed without distortion. These are enabling conventions of the style. The classic writer is not necessarily free of doubts about his enterprise, but as a performer he must appear to be. An acrobat, a concert pianist, an actor cannot simultaneously perform and question the possibility of performing. Classic style is a style for performance, not a style for questioning its own competence.

When we open a cookbook, we completely put aside — and expect the author to put aside — the kind of question that leads to the heart of certain philosophic and religious traditions. Is it possible to talk about cooking? Do eggs really exist? Is food something about which knowledge is possible? Can anyone else ever tell us anything true about cooking? These questions may lead to enlightenment or to satori; they do not lead to satisfying dinners. Readers of cookbooks expect to see cooking treated directly, as if such metaphysical and epistemological questions could never be entertained by anyone, even though we know they can be and have been entertained by saints and sages. We do not expect the writer to be immobilized by preliminary discussions of whether it is possible to talk about「cooking,」if such a thing even exists. Classic style similarly puts aside as inappropriate philosophical questions about its enterprise. If it took those questions up, it could never get around to treating its subject, and its purpose is exclusively to treat its subject.

Raising skeptical doubts about the writer's own enterprise is a feature of nonclassic self-conscious styles. In such styles, the writer's chief, if unstated, concern is to escape being convicted of philosophical naïveté about his own enterprise. Such a writer is careful to gesture periodically toward the contingent frame of his own discourse, to disclaim any belief that his writing can treat any subject directly. The style stays in the foreground, inextricably mingled with its announced subject. It is marked with formulaic hedges concerning the possibility of knowledge, the contingency of knowledge, and the ability of language to express knowledge.「Impotence principles」such as the doctrine that discourse can never be about anything except itself share the focus of the writer's attention with any possible subject.

Classic prose does not discuss doubts or fears about its own enterprise, not because it is naïve, but because it has chosen something incompatible with reflexive inquiry. We can question the possibility of acting or we can act, but we cannot do both at once. Classic writers make an unspoken choice: they act. Rather than discuss the possibility of action, they put that possibility to the test, and let the reader be the judge.

Clifford Geertz, in Works and Lives: The Anthropologist as Author, quotes an example of such a self-referential and self-questioning style from the introduction,「Self and Other,」to Loring Danforth's The Death Rituals of Rural Greece:

Anthropology inevitably involves an encounter with the Other. All too often, however, the ethnographic distance that separates the reader of anthropological texts and the anthropologist himself from the Other is rigidly maintained and at times even artificially exaggerated. In many cases this distancing leads to an exclusive focus on the Other as primitive, bizarre, and exotic. The gap between a familiar「we」and an exotic「they」is a major obstacle to a meaningful understanding of the Other, an obstacle that can only be overcome through some form of participation in the world of the Other.

Geertz comments:

The brooding note of Loring Danforth's「Introduction」(Who am I to be saying these things, by what right, and to what purpose, and how on earth can I manage honestly to say them?) is one now very widely heard, in various forms and with various intensities.

Clifford Geertz, an acute observer of style, calls attention here to one mark of reflexive style. Reflexive styles might consider classic style to be naïve or philistine; but there is nothing naïve in a tacit acceptance of incongruities in the nature of writing and nothing philistine in making unhedged choices.

1.5.2 古典风格不是反思风格

古典风格的呈现立场是，写作是一面完全透明的窗户，事物透过这扇窗户呈现出来；毋庸置疑，作者有呈现的能力，语言可以充分表达这种呈现。

这种基本立场使古典风格与一组风格完全对立，这些风格的文章本身和可能谈论的任何主题一样惹人注意，写作的困难直接展示在读者面前。

古典文章可以呈现任何事物，但即使写作主题就是写作本身，也不会把读者的注意力吸引到写作过程上。拉布吕耶尔说「写作要想自然、有力、生动，必须表达出真相」时，谈的是好文章的条件，但他这样做时并没有让读者注意到他自己的写作。

亚历山大·蒲柏（Alexander Pope）在《论批评》（An Essay on Criticism）中批评坏诗时，模仿他批评的那种毛病，让读者注意到写作本身：「十字渐横移，一行常枯燥」（And ten low Words oft creep in one dull Line）12。古典风格是一种表演风格，虽然古典风格作者可以怀疑任何其他事情，但唯独不能在表演的过程中怀凝自身的表演能力。古典风格作者假定他的主题可以被理解，可以不偏不倚地表达出来。这些是古典风格的基本规约。古典风格作者不一定对自己写的东西坚信不疑，但作为一名表演者，他必须表现成这样。杂技演员、钢琴演奏家、演员不可能一边表演一边质疑表演的可能性。古典风格是一种表演风格，而不是一种自我怀疑的风格。

当我们打开一本烹饪菜谱时，我们完全不会考虑 —— 也不认为作者会考虑 —— 那种涉及某些哲学和宗教传统的核心问题。烹饪能被谈论吗？鸡蛋真的存在吗？食物能用知识来解释吗？有谁能说出烹饪的任何真相吗？这些问题可能让人受到启发或顿悟，但无法教我们做出满意的餐食。看菜谱的人希望看到直接讲怎么烹饪，就好像没人会想到这种抽象的认识论问题一样，虽然我们知道圣人和智者会思考这些问题，也确实思考过。我们并不希望「烹饪」是否能被谈论这样的问题难住作者，使他无法动笔写，尽管这样的事情确实存在。同理，古典风格不会考虑不合时宜的哲学问题。如果讨论这些问题，文章可能无暇顾及它的主题，而它的目的只是论述它的主题。

自我意识强的非古典风格有个特点：作者会怀疑自己的写作内容。在这类风格中，即便未明言，作者最关心的是，如何避免被批评自己写的东西从哲学角度看太天真。这样的作者时不时慎重地声明他要说的话仅视特定情况而言，他的文章不可能考虑到所有问题。这种风格非常显眼，与它说的主题糅杂在一起。它的特点是，用很多迂回的套话说明认识的可能性、认识的偶然性及语言表达认识的能力。无论作者谈论的主题是什么，作者总要提及「无能原则」，比如言语不可能谈论其本身以外的任何事物。

古典文章不会讨论它对写作内容的疑惑或担忧，不是因为它天真，而是因为它选了不同于反思探究的立场。我们可以怀疑行动的可能性，或者我们也可以先行动起来，但我们不能已经行动了还怀疑行动的可能性。古典风格作者默认选择：行动。不是讨论行动的可能性，而是让这种可能性接受检验，让读者自己来判断。

克利福德·格尔茨在《论著与生活：作为作者的人类学家》（Words and Lives: The Anthropologist as Author）这本书中，举了自我参照和自我质疑风格的例子，例子引自洛林·丹福思（Loring Danforth）的《希腊乡村的死亡仪式》（The Death Rituals of Rural Greece）的序言「自我与他人」（Self and Other）：

人类学必然会涉及与其他人的交互。但人类学文章的作者及读者与其他人严格保持着种群距离，这种距离有时甚至被人为夸大。很多时候，这种疏远只会使人看到其他人原始、怪诞和外来的一面。熟悉的「我们」与外来的「他们」之间的隔阔，是深入理解其他人的主要障碍，要克服这种障碍，只有通过某种形式参与到其他人的世界里。

格尔茨评论道：

洛林·丹福思「引言」中这段沉思之语（我有什么资格说这些事情，有什么权利说，又为什么说，还有我到底怎样才能如实说出来？）是现在经常听到的一种风格，它们可以表现出不同的形式和强烈程度。13

克利福德·格尔茨对风格有敏锐的观察，这里指出了反思风格的一个特征。反思风格可能认为古典风格太天真或太庸俗。但是，默认写作本身的矛盾性并非天真，直截了当地表达也并非庸俗。

#### 1.5.3 Classic Style Is Not Practical Style

In the model scene behind practical style, the reader has a problem to solve, a decision to make, a ruling to hand down, an inquiry to conduct, a machine to design or repair — in short, a job to do. The reader's need, not the writer's desire to articulate something, initiates the writing. The writer's job is to serve the reader's immediate need by delivering timely materials. The motive can thus be almost anything productive of a need: greed, enterprise, competition, philanthropy. Since the reader is engaged in solving a problem, the reading is not an end in itself, it is instrumental to some other end. That is why, in this scene, the prime stylistic virtue is ease of parsing. In practical style, the best presentation will allow the reader to acquire timely information with a minimum of distraction because, in this scene, writing is an instrument for delivering information with maximum efficiency and in such a way as to place the smallest possible burden upon the reader, who has other — more important — burdens to bear.

In classic style, by contrast, neither writer nor reader has a job, the writing and reading do not serve a practical goal, and the writer has all the time in the world to present her subject as something interesting for its own sake. Her characteristic brevity comes from the elegance of her mind, never from pressures of time or employment. The writing is initiated by the writer, not the reader: the writer wants to present something not to a client, but to an indefinite audience, treated as if it were a single individual. Her motive is to present truth, not so that someone can use it to accomplish a practical goal, although someone might make use of it for such a purpose, but for its own sake.

Classic style and practical style have important areas of overlap; both styles place a high value on clarity and directness. Classic style values clarity because it sees itself as a transparent medium for the presentation of truth. Practical style values clarity because it places a premium on being easy to parse. Both styles can be described as precise and efficient, but for quite different reasons: practical style is precise and efficient because the reader wants to understand well and quickly for the purpose of making immediate use of what he is reading; classic style is precise and efficient because precision serves truth and because efficiency is a refinement. The efficiency of classic style is a sign of its having the leisure and luxury to afford refinement: the writer and reader have had all the time needed to train their minds to the requisite concert pitch.

Neither classic style nor practical style contains much of the sort of internal network of cross-references that linguists call「metadiscourse」(「I would like to tell you about X but first I have to tell you about y」). In classic style, such explicit acknowledgment of planning defeats the immediacy and spontaneity that mark the style's model scene, conversation. In practical style, a network of cross-references, clotting the text, is a poor substitute for less distracting indications of coherence.

There are a few recognizable prototypes of the model scene of practical style. The first, drawn from the world of corporate business or the legal profession, is a memorandum to a superior who has asked for information. The writer knows more about the subject than the reader, but it is the reader who will make a decision or take action, and so stands in need of some of the writer's knowledge. The reader's need is the motive for writing. A second prototype is a memorandum to a subordinate whose activities the superior is trying to direct and manage. In neither case does the reader want or expect to know everything the writer knows about the subject. Practical style is selective in a way that classic style is not. The cast is hierarchical, not symmetric. Clustered around these prototypes are recognizable extensions: the manual telling someone how to perform routine jobs; the manual telling someone how to use something; the how-to book instructing the CEO in the art of negotiation; the book about financial planning telling those with discretionary income how to invest it; the advisory from a manufacturer to owners of the manufactured product telling them that it has a defect and how to get it fixed.

Another prototype of this scene is the delivery of the results of research to fellow researchers, which is to say, fellow insiders. The writer knows more about his own research than the readers do, but they are fellow professionals who expect to know everything he knows as a result of reading his report, or know at least what they need to know for their own purposes. What is reported will affect their own independent activities in ways that they alone can judge. The writer is imparting information and does not want his writing, as such, to be noticed; it should fulfill every standard expectation and be as easy to parse as possible.

Most writing in schools and colleges is a perversion of practical style: the student pretends that he is writing a memorandum. He pretends that he knows more than the reader, that the reader needs this information, and that his job is to impart that information in a way that is easy for the reader to parse. This pretense is supposed to be practice for the real thing. Actually, the reader (the teacher) probably knows much more about the subject than the writer; the reader (the teacher) has no need whatever for the information; and the job of the writer is to cover himself from attack by his superior (the teacher). The actual scene interferes so much with the fantasy scene that the result is almost inevitably compromised, if not fraudulent.

The best-known teachers of practical style are Strunk and White, in their ubiquitous Elements of Style. The best teachers of practical style are Joseph Williams and Gregory Colomb, in Williams's Style: Toward Clarity and Grace and a series of academic articles and technical reports.

Strunk and White's disarming treatment of what everybody really needs to know about writing has been treasured by generations of people who are occasionally forced to write something and view the prospect with a sinking feeling of dread. As a guide to writing, The Elements of Style, being little more than an apparently arbitrary mixture of grammatical digest, handy list of common mistakes, and expert hand-holding, is drastically incomplete, but it is a masterpiece of psychological insight. Its attractions derive, we suspect, first, from its implicit, cheery, and optimistic promise that if you just read its few pages and work those few surface tricks it teaches you (「In summaries, keep to one tense,」「less should not be used for fewer」), you will not embarrass yourself; second, from its exhortatory cheerleading that seems so assured and upbeat; and third, from its tone of common sense that masks, at key points, an essential vacuousness:「Choose a suitable design and hold to it.」

Such advice has the same immemorial power of「Just use your head, and you'll be all right.」Advice of this sort has the great merit of being brief and supportive. There is a welcome assurance that there is really nothing to it, except for those truly mysterious aspects of the subject that cannot be taught at all.「I can teach you where to put a comma in ten minutes, but don't expect me to teach you to write like Shakespeare.」

Williams and Colomb present an incomparably deeper and more orderly treatment of practical style. The style they present is consistent and mature; it makes decisions about all the major questions that define a style, and is fully developed. The claim behind Williams and Colomb's treatment is large and theoretical: just as readers of an English sentence have expectations about word order and the distribution of information in a sentence, so readers of what Williams and Colomb call「pointed texts」have in their minds a grammar of such texts that tells them where to look for what. Readers will use that grammar. Writing that conforms to it will be easy for the reader to follow. Writing that resists it will be difficult for the reader to follow. For example, a reader looks for an opening section (「the issue」) and a following section (「the discussion」) within each unit of a pointed text. He looks for a rich lexical field, at the end of the issue, which will be used to weave the discussion together, to give it cohesion, as it progresses. He looks for a point at the end of the discussion. If there is a point at the end of the issue, it will be taken to be an adumbration of the point at the end of the discussion. Units of discourse nest, so that units within the discussion will themselves be composed of an issue and a discussion. These principles work themselves down to the level of the sentence, where the reader expects the first part of the sentence to present an issue (topic) and the second part of the sentence to present a discussion (comment). The reader expects old information in the sentence before new. The reader prefers to understand things in terms of actions and agents, so the backbone of a sentence should be a verb that conveys action, and the subject of such a verb should be one of the agents — perhaps metaphorical — in this action-story. Since readers link agents to actions in pairs, writers should try not to separate the subject (agent) from the verb (action) with distracting information. And so on.

Williams and Colomb's finely detailed treatment of practical style provides an indispensable guide impressive in its scope and intelligence. It is missing just one thing, namely, an explicit acknowledgment of its fundamental stand, and an acknowledgment that its fundamental stand is one of many alternatives. While their work is thorough, systematic, and theoretically sophisticated, and while they know that they are dealing with just one style, the work is misleading in its self-presentation: it pretends that the style it concerns, and about which it gives excellent advice, is universal and exclusive rather than merely ubiquitous. Practical style rests on a set of answers to basic questions; other styles rest on different answers to those same questions.

Practical style comes from deciding that what matters in style is the reader, and in particular the reader's ease in parsing features of the text, especially the discourse features of the text. Practical style is so firm in this decision that it treats it as no decision at all, but as a necessity: of course excellence of style consists in conforming to the reader's grammatical expectations in the act of reading. Why else would anyone presume to take up a reader's time than to solve a problem for the reader? Why then would anyone write except to inform the reader about a solution to that problem? How else can this be done aside from ordering the text so that readers can get the point before giving up in the face of the obvious difficulty? Williams and Colomb accordingly coach their students in a style of writing assimilated to a model of reading.

Classic style makes similar pretenses in adopting the rather different stand that the writer counts equally with the reader, that both are fully engaged by the subject, competent, and alert, that of course the reader will be interested in what the writer has to say, and that of course the reader will recognize truth once it has been clearly presented.

In the model scene of practical style, readers and writers hold standard job slots in existing institutions. The reader has no leisure and does not want surprises; the reader reads not for personal reasons but to accomplish a job. Accomplishing the job depends upon the communication of information, and practical style serves the purpose of keeping the information flowing efficiently through institutions. Since students will go on to such employment, they must be trained to write in practical style. The writer is not an individual writing to another individual but a job description writing to another job description. There is a job to do and practical style is the appropriate tool for doing it: the style is thus fundamentally optimistic, pragmatic, and utilitarian. The motive is the job; eternal and noncontingent truth is irrelevant except as it bears upon the performance of the job — even then its eternal and noncontingent nature is beside the point.

There is a surface mark of practical style as presented by Williams and Colomb that derives from its fundamental stand and distinguishes it sharply from classic style. If the reader always expects to find certain kinds of things in certain「discourse locations,」and the writer submits uniformly to those expectations, then the style permits skimming, because the cream is always in the same place. This can be highly useful in certain practical situations: if you are sitting at a desk and need to plow through forty-three memos, most of whose substance you already know, it will be a great help if you can rely upon the memos to present their main points in the expected places; then you can simply glance through and extract what you want.

If you try to skim classic writing in this way, you run the risk of missing indispensable conceptual nuances or refinements. In the model scene of classic style, the classic reader is not pressed for time, distracted by jobs to do, or mired in routine. The classic reader is competent, sophisticated, quite able to handle surprises, and unimpressed with predictability. The surface mark of classic style that is most uncongenial to practical style can be picked out by what we will call the「last-third」test: once you have progressed a little way into a piece of writing, block out the last third of each sentence as you come to it, and imagine the standard things you might expect to occupy that position, based on what you have already read. If what in fact does occupy that position is routinely one of those standard and expected things, then the piece may be a paragon of practical writing but is unlikely to be classic. This is not because classic sentences reverse themselves at the end: once you see the end of a classic sentence, you will recognize that the sentence was true to its direction, but that does not make the sentence predictable, because it usually contains a conceptual refinement that is clear and simple as the truth but not a cliché and hence not predictable. Here are four passages that pass the last-third test beautifully; none of them is likely to occur in practical style:

Although a dirty campaign was widely predicted, for the most part the politicians contented themselves with insults and lies. (Julian Barnes on the 1992 British parliamentary elections)

With peer pressure and whippings at school and at home, we were soon completely socialized and as happy as children anywhere. (Ruth Baer Lambach)

In the same year [1827] the United Kingdom, Russia and France decided to intervene to enforce an armistice「without however taking any part in the hostilities.」The allied fleet went to parley with the Turkish fleet anchored in Navarino Bay (Pylos) and ended up destroying it. (Greece [Michelin Green Guide])

It is from this weighing of delights against their cost that the student eater (particularly if he is a student at the University of Paris) erects the scale of values that will serve him until he dies or has to reside in the Middle West for a long period. (A. J. Liebling)

1.5.3 古典风格不是实用风格

在实用风格背后的典型场景中，读者需要解决一个问题，做出一个决定，宣布一项裁决结果，开展一项调查，设计或修理一台机器 —— 总之有一项任务要做。激发写作动力的是读者的需要，而不是作者的表达欲望。作者的任务是及时提供资料，满足读者的迫切需求。因此几乎任何能激发需求的东西都可以成为写作动机：贪婪、上进、竞争、慈善。因为读者要解决问题，所以阅读本身不是目的，它只是为了帮助实现其他目的。这就是为什么在这种场景中主要的风格特点是易于解读。在实用风格中，最好的呈现是让读者在尽可能少的干扰下及时获取信息，在这种场景中，写作是一种高效传达信息的工具，这样才能尽可能减少读者的负担，因为他们有其他更重要的任务要承担。

相反，在古典风格中，作者和读者都没有任务在身，写作和阅读不是为了实现某个实用目的，而作者有足够充分的时间呈现他的主题的趣味，因为它本来就有趣。古典风格作者的用语特点是简练，但简练是因为思想优雅，绝不是时间或雇主所迫。写作的动机是作者要写，而不是读者要看：作者不是写给某个客户看，而是写给不确定的读者看，这些读者在作者眼里就好像是一个个独立的个体。他的动机是呈现真相，而不是为了方便某人实现某个实用目的，虽然人们可能把它用于这样的目的，但也是为了真相本身。

古典风格和实用风格在很多重要地方有共同点：两种风格都注重清晰直接。古典风格清晰，是因为它把自己看作一种呈现真相的透明媒介。实用风格清晰，是因为它注重句子容易解读。两种风格都可以用准确和高效来形容，但原因大不相同：实用风格准确高效，是因为读者为了立即用上所读内容而需要快速准确地理解；古典风格准确高效，是因为准确服务于真相，高效源于精炼。古典风格高效，说明它有足够的闲暇和兴致锤炼思想：作者和读者均有充分的时间，把他们的思想校准到必要的高效能状态（concert Pitch）。

古典风格和实用风格不会在同一写作环境内交织很多互相参照的内容，即语言学家说的「元话语」（metadiscourse）（讲到 X 之前，我要先说说 Y。在古典风格中，这么直白地承认事先谋划，会破环它的典型场景所特有的那种即兴感。在实用风格中，各种相互参照使文本不通畅，干扰注意力，是逻辑不够连贯的表现。

实用风格的典型场景有一些常见的原型。第一种，常见于企业商圈和法律界，是一种按上级要求的信息写的备忘录。作者比读者更了解主题，但做决定或采取行动的是读者，所以需要作者提供某些知识。读者的需求是作者写作的动机。第二种原型是上级要指导和管理下属活动时写给下属的备忘录。这两类场合的读者不想了解也没打算了解作者知道的所有主题信息。实用风格有选择地呈现，古典风格不会。实用风格的角色有层级之分，并非对等。这些原型延伸出很多其他常见类型：日常工作指导手册，物品使用指南，CEO 谈判艺术入门指南，理财规划之自由支配收入投资指南，工业制造品常见故障维修手册。

这种场景的另一个原型是面向同行研究员即业内人士发布研究成果。作者比读者更了解自己的研究，但他们这些同行专家想阅读他的报告，了解他掌握的所有信息，或至少他们为各自目的需要掌握的内容。报告的内容将影响他们各自独立的活动，但他们自己可以辨别这种影响。作者传达信息，并不想读者关注他的写作本身；它应该在每个标准位置提供读者需要的信息，并且尽可能容易解读。

大部分大学及院校的写作误用了实用风格：学生假装他在写备忘录。他假装他懂的比读者多，所以读者需要这些信息，而他的任务是用一种方便读者解读的方式传达信息。这种假装本来是对真实场景的练习。实际上，读者（老师）很可能远比作者了解主题，读者（老师）根本用不上这些信息，而作者的任务是掩护自己不被上级（老师）挑错。

实际场景对理想场景造成很大的干扰，这样写出来的东西，如果算不上作假，那也几乎不可避免会大打折扣。

实用风格最知名的老师是斯特伦克和怀特，他们写过畅销书《风格的要素》。实用风格最好的老师是约瑟夫·威廉斯和格雷戈里·科伦，他们写过《风格：清晰、优雅地写作》及一系列学术论文和技术报告。

斯特伦克和怀特提出的每个人真正需要掌握的写作知识，对那些有时不得不写但又特别担心自己写不出来的人来说是一种宽慰，一直以来深受几代人的追捧。《风格的要素》作为一本写作指导书非常不全面，很明显只不过是随机汇总了精编语法知识点、常见错误实用清单和专家解读，但这是一本心理洞察的杰作。我们觉得它之所以吸引人有三个原因：

其一，它向读者透露出某种积极乐观的承诺：只要你读上几页并用对它教你的那几个表面技巧（「概述时，自始至终使用同一种时态」「不要把形容可数名词的比较级 fewer 误用为形容不可数名词的比较级 less」），你就不会让自己难堪；其二，人们对它的认可和支持看起来如此坚定和满怀期待；其三，一些关键位置的内容本来空洞贫乏，用一种常识的口吻讲述后倒显得必不可少了：「文章的格局一经选定，千万不能偏离。」

这种建议就跟说「只要你动脑，就不会出错」一样，有一种古老的力量。这种类型的建议的优势是，简洁且鼓舞人心。它的自信令人心安：除了那些完全不可能教授的神秘之处外，它真没什么诀窍。「我可以用十分钟教你在哪里打逗号，但不要想着我把你教成莎士比亚。」

威廉斯和科伦论述实用风格的方式更深刻、更有条理。他们呈现的是一种成熟一致的风格；他们的风格对定义风格的重大问题做出了决定，是一种发展完善的风格。威廉斯和科伦论述背后的主张范围广、理论强：正如读者阅读某个英文句子，会预判一句话的词序排列和信息分布，读者阅读威廉斯和科伦说的「观点文本」（pointed texts）时，心里依据的是一种在什么位置找什么信息的语法。读者会使用那种语法。文章用了这种语法后很容易读懂，不用这种语法就很难读懂。

比如，读者可以在一篇观点文本的每个单元找出开头段落（议题）和后续段落（讨论）。在议题的结尾，他可以找出丰富的词汇场（lexical field），这部分会整合讨论内容，把每一步有序地串联起来。在讨论的结尾，他可以找出问题点。如果议题结尾提出了问题，那么讨论的结尾会给出这个问题的概述。话语单元交织成句，所以构成讨论的单元本身也由议题和讨论构成。句子层面也遵循同样的原则，读者预判句子第一部分是议题（话题），第二部分是讨论（评论）。读者预判句子先说已知信息，然后再讲新信息。读者倾向根据行动和执行者理解事情，因此句子主干应该是一个表达行动的动词，这个动词的主语应该是一个执行者 —— 或许用一种比喻说法 —— 是某组行动故事（action-story）中的一个执行者。因为读者把执行者和行动看成一组关联内容，作者应该尽量避免用干扰信息隔断主语（执行者）和动词（行动）。诸如此类还有很多。

威廉斯和科伦对实用风格翔实细致的论述，不仅涉及范围广，而且思想深邃，提供了一份必要的指导。美中不足的一个地方是，没有明确承认它的基本立场，以及承认它的基本立场只是众多立场中的一种。虽然他们的作品论述翔实、体系完整、理论成熟，虽然作者知道他们只是论述一种风格，但作品在自我呈现方面误导了读者：它对它讨论的风格提出的建议很精彩，但它假装这种风格可以普遍适用且仅此一种，不只是应用广泛。实用风格基于对一组基本问题的回答；对这组问题的回答不同，则形成的风格也不同。

形成实用风格的最基本立场是，风格中最重要的是读者，主要是读者能轻松分析出文本特征，特别是文本的语言特征。实用风格非常坚信这一点，它觉得这不是一项决定，而是一种必然：优秀风格所用语法当然要符合读者阅读时的预期。为什么有人要占用读者的时间而不是解决他的问题？为什么有人要写问题解决方案之外的东西？除了把文本组织得易读些，避免读者遇到难懂的直接放弃，还可以怎么做？因此，威廉斯和科伦给他们的学生训练的写作风格内化了某种阅读模式。

古典风格做了类似的假定，但采取的立场有些不同：读者重要，作者也同等重要；双方都很关注这个话题，胜任且专注；作者说的话读者当然感兴趣；一旦清晰地呈现，读者当然会看出来。

在实用风格的典型场景中，读者与作者要根据现有的惯例完成标准任务。读者没有闲心，也不想读出什么惊喜；读者不是为了个人原因阅读，而是为了完成任务。完成任务的前提是信息交流，而实用风格就是遵循惯例确保信息高效流通。因为学生要从事这样的工作，必须训练他们的实用风格写作。作者不是作为个体向另一个个体写作，而是用一项工作描述回应另一项工作描述。对于一项任务来说，实用风格是最合适的工具：因此实用风格的基本上是乐观、实用和功利的。动机是完成任务：如不是跟完成任务相关，永恒和必然的真相无关紧要 —— 即使有关，真相永恒和必然的特点也不是最重要的。

如威廉斯和科伦指出，实用风格有个表面特征源于它的基本立场，使之与古典风格明显不同。如果读者总是期待在某些「语篇位置」找到某种东西，作者也完全迎合这些期待，那么这种风格可以略读，因为要点总是在同一个地方。在某些实用场合这很好用：如果你要坐在位子上看一份长达四十三页的备忘录，大部分内容你都熟悉，这时候如果备忘录都把要点放在预期位置上，会省不少事；这样你只用迅速扫几眼就能提取你想要的信息。

如果你用这种方式略读古典文章，你可能会忽视一些重要思想的微妙或精要之处。在古典风格的典型场景中，古典风格读者不会觉得时间紧迫，也不会分心想着没完成的任务，或陷入套话中。古典风格读者可以胜任，思想成熟，能够应对意料之外的内容，不要求文章可预测。古典风格与实用风格最不同的表面特征，可以用一个测试看出来，我们称为「最后三分之一」（last-third）测试：文章读了一部分后，看后面的每句话都先遮住最后三分之一的部分，根据你读完的部分猜想遮住部分可能的标准内容，如果那个部分实际表达的内容总是和预期的标准内容一致，那这篇文章可能是典型的实用写作，但不可能是古典风格。这不是说古典句子在句未否定了自己：在古典风格中，当你看一句话的结尾，你会看到句子方向一致，但这不代表可以预测句子，因为它常常包含精炼的思想，它和真相一样清晰简单，但不是陈词溢调，因此不可预测。下面四段话均顺利通过最后三分之一的测试，它们不可能出现在实用风格中。

虽然很多人预料这是一场不公平的选举活动，但总的来说政治家们对侮辱和谎言都感到满意。（朱利安·巴恩斯 1992 年英国议会选举）14

#### 1.5.4 Classic Style Is Not Contemplative Style

Classic style implicitly defines itself as a normal, practically inevitable, perspective. It makes continual if tacit claims to transparency; it does not interpret; it merely presents. These claims are, of course, false. When the style succeeds, it simply obscures the distinction and manages to pass off interpretation as presentation.

In contemplative style, the distinction between presentation and interpretation is always observed: the writer sees something, presents it to the reader, and then interprets it. The stress is on the interpretation, but the transition is always explicitly marked. E. B. White, a master of the contemplative essay, characteristically observes this sequence, as he does in「The Ring of Time,」a dazzling piece of writing that is entirely unclassic. White describes himself casually observing a practice session of a circus, watching the lion tamer, a big, brown horse, and then a circus rider. He tells the reader precisely what he sees and how he sees it:「As she emerged in front of us, I saw that she was barefoot, her dirty little feet fighting the uneven ground. In most respects she was like any of two or three dozen showgirls you encounter if you wander about the winter quarters of Mr. John Ringling North's circus, in Sarasota — cleverly proportioned, deeply browned by the sun, dusty, eager, and almost naked.」White describes what he sees and what anyone there with him might see. And then he contemplates what he sees and offers an interpretation:「I became painfully conscious of the element of time. Everything in the hideous old building seemed to take the shape of a circle, conforming to the course of the horse. The rider's gaze, as she peered straight ahead, seemed to be circular, as though bent by force of circumstance; then time itself began running in circles, and so the beginning was where the end was, and the two were the same, and one thing ran into the next and time went round and around and got nowhere.」He then sees that the girl is deluded:「She is at that enviable moment in life [I thought] when she believes she can go once around the ring, make one complete circuit, and at the end be exactly the same age as at the start.」The associations, the connections, the very way he turns a commonplace event into an allegory of time belong to him alone; contemplative style assumes that this is not what someone standing next to him would see. In contemplative style, the focus is on the interpretation and not on the event.

White stands in a tradition of American preachers who present a text and then interpret it. The common scene that White sees becomes, through his contemplation of it, an allegory of the world, which the reader is allowed to see because White offers his superior vision. He begins to discuss things that in principle the reader has no way of checking, and he does not hesitate to refer to himself as something like an authority.「The circus comes as close to being the world in microcosm as anything I know; in a way, it puts all the rest of show business in the shade. Its magic is universal and complex. Out of its wild disorder comes order; from its rank smell rises the good aroma of courage and daring; out of its preliminary shabbiness comes the final splendor.」The asymmetry between writer and reader is profound. White takes the attitude that the reader could be perfectly competent and yet, in looking at this scene, see none of what he sees.

The first fundamental distinction between classic style and contemplative style is thus that classic style presents something but contemplative style presents an interpretation of something. This entails many different decisions concerning truth, presentation, cast, and scene.

The second fundamental distinction between classic style and contemplative style has to do with thought and language. Classic language is an instrument for presenting the product of thought according to the order of reason, not according to the sequence of experience. In contemplative style, writing is itself the engine of discovery: the writing is a record of the process of the writer's thinking, quite independent of its relation to the order of reason. In contemplative style, the touchstone of the writing is the process of the writer's contemplation. That process and the writer's engagement in it often become an explicit subject of the writing:

In attempting to recapture this mild spectacle, I am merely acting as recording secretary for one of the oldest of societies — the society of those who, at one time or another, have surrendered, without even a show of resistance, to the bedazzlement of a circus rider. As a writing man, or secretary, I have always felt charged with the safekeeping of all unexpected items of worldly or unworldly enchantment, as though I might be held personally responsible if even a small one were to be lost. . . . The ten-minute ride the girl took achieved — as far as I was concerned, who wasn't looking for it, and quite unbeknownst to her, who wasn't even striving for it — the thing that is sought by performers everywhere. . . . As I watched with the others, our jaws adroop, our eyes alight, I became painfully conscious of the element of time. . . . i thought:「She will never be as beautiful as this again」 — a thought that made me acutely unhappy — and in a flash my mind (which is too much of a busybody to suit me) had projected her twenty-five years ahead.

Rather than presenting truth, White often quotes his own contemplation, giving its history:

「She is at that enviable moment in life [I thought] when she believes she can go once around the ring, make one complete circuit, and at the end be exactly the same age as at the start.」. . . And then I slipped back into my trance, and time was circular again — time, pausing quietly with the rest of us, so as not to disturb the balance of a performer.

In these passages, White uses many of the surface marks of clarity, precision, and accurate vocabulary that are associated with classic style. But his fundamental stand on the elements of style is very far from the classic stand. Regardless of language or phrasing, none of these passages could fit comfortably in a classic text.

Because contemplation is a superior achievement by a superior individual who talks about the difficulties of contemplation, contemplative style splits into two modes that are not incompatible and that can be used alternately. Sometimes, the contemplative writer succeeds fully in his achievement: thought and language can be adequate. Thoreau frequently writes as if he has been successful in his contemplations. But sometimes, the contemplative writer fails in his achievement, and feels compelled to settle for what is merely his best effort. White often does this, as when he writes,「But it is not easy to communicate anything of this nature.」

At other moments, White seems to take the extreme stand that language is always inadequate to the task:「It has been ambitious and plucky of me to attempt to describe what is indescribable, and I have failed, as I knew i would. But I have discharged my duty to my society; and besides, a writer, like an acrobat, must occasionally try a stunt that is too much for him.」

1.5.4 古典风格不是沉思风格

古典风格默认自己是一种普通但又很难避开的视角。虽未明示，但它一直主张透明；它不解释，它只是呈现。这些说法当然不对。成功的古典风格表达只是弱化两者的差别，把解释表现为呈现。

在沉思风格中，可以看到呈现与解释的界限：作者看到什么，就呈现给读者，再对它解释说明。重点在解释上，但过渡有明显的标记。E. B. 怀特擅用沉思风格写作，常用到这种过渡顺序，他写的《时光之环》正是如此，文风绚烂，但完全不是古典风格。怀特描述他自己偶然观看的一场马戏团训练，有驯狮员、一匹棕色大马和一名马戏团骑手。他确切地告诉读者他看到了什么和怎么看到的：「等她出现在我们面前，我见她赤着双脚，邋遢的小脚丫在坑坑洼洼的地面上趔趄。从许多方面看，她与你在萨拉索塔县约翰·林林先生北方马戏团冬季营地可能碰到的二三十个小丫头没什么两样，身材匀称，皮肤给阳光晒成棕色，邋遏，热切，几乎是赤身裸体。」① 18 怀特描述他看到的画面，任何和他一起在那儿的人都能看到这个画面。他这样思考和解释他的所见：「我与他人一道观望，下颌低垂，眼晴闪亮，一边痛苦地意识到时光的因素。这老旧的庞大建筑中的一切，似乎都呈现圆环形状，与奔马的线路契合。骑手凝视前方，她的目光似乎也是环形的，好像是在环境的压力下弯曲：接着，时光本身也开始循环运动，终结处是起始，二者再无区别，一件事融入下一件事，时光如斯，一圈又一圈地流逝，没个了结。」接着他又看到女孩如何陷入错觉中：《我想）当她相信她能绕着圆环，做出二个完整的圆圈，她在终点时的年纪正是她在起点时的年纪，她处在一种令人美慕的生命时刻。」这种联想，这种连接，这种把一件平常事物变成时间讽喻的方式，只属于怀特自己；沉思风格认为，这不是站在他的位置就能看到的东西。在沉思风格中，解释比事物本身更重要。

① 汉译文选自贾辉丰翻译版本，本书其他《E。 B. 怀特随笔》「时光之环」选段均出自该版本。—— 译者注

怀特遵循的是一种美国传教士的传统，先陈述一段话，然后对它进行解释。怀特本来看到的是普通场景，经过一番沉思后，变成了对世界的讽喻故事，读者能看到只是因为怀特提供了他自己的优越视角。他开始讨论的事情原则上是读者无法验证的，他又毫不犹豫地把自己称作某种权威。「据我所知，没有什么，比马戏团更像一个世界的缩影，在某种程度上，它使所有演艺团体都相形见绌。它的神奇力量既普遍又复杂。它在混乱中见出秩序，粗鄙中见出勇气和胆魄，乍看之下的浅陋中见出最终的辉煌。」作者与读者明显不对等。怀特的态度是，读者可以完全胜任，只是这个场景只有他看得到，读者看不到。

因此古典风格和沉思风格之间的第一个根本区别是：古典风格呈现事物，而沉思风格呈现对事物的解释。这引发二者在真相、呈现、角色和场景上的许多不同决定。

2『上面古典风格与沉思风格的区别，补充进主题卡片「古典风格」里。（2022-03-20）』—— 已完成

古典风格与沉思风格之间的第二个根本区别与思想和语言有关。古典语言是一种呈现思想产物的工具，这种呈现依据的是推理顺序，而不是体验顺序。在沉思风格中，写作本身是发现的引擎：写作是对作者思考过程的记录，完全独立于它与推理顺序的关系。在沉思风格中，作者的思素过程是衡量作品好坏的标准。文章呈现的鲜明主题常常是那种思索过程和作者参与其中的体验：

我在这里再现这一舒缓的场景，不过是为一个最古老的群落充当书记员，这个群落中人，曾经在某个时候，甚至不做一点抗拒，等闲就迷上了一位马戏团的骑手。身为作家，或书记员，我始终觉得有义务记录下所有世俗的或非世俗的奇闻逸事，仿佛有一点遗漏也难免给人追究责任…...女孩儿这十分钟的驱驰 —— 就我而言，我并没有期待这些，她也并不知道我在场，而她，甚至也不是有意为之 —— 但这十分钟，却进入了任何地方任何舞台上的演艺者都在追求的境界…...我想：「她绝不会再像此刻这样美丽了。」—— 如此一个念头让我深感惆怅 —— 我的思想（这般活跃让我难以招架）一下子投射到二十五年后。

怀特不是呈现真相，而是经常引用自己的沉思，赋予它历史：

「她正当让人艳美的美妙年华（我想），以为她可以绕行一周，成就一个完整的圆，最后恰恰回到开始的年龄。」…...不知不觉中，我又进入了出神的状态，时间再度循环一时间，在我们这里停顿了，免得打扰表演者的平衡。

怀特写的这些段落清晰、准确、用词恰当，这些都是跟古典风格相关的表面特征。但他在风格元素上的基本立场完全偏离古典立场。不管用什么语言和什么措辞，上面任何一段话都无法融入古典文本中。

因为沉思是优越的个体谈论沉思之难时思索出来的东西，因此沉思风格分为两种模式，二者互不排斥，也可以交替使用。有时，沉思风格的作者能完全呈现他的思想：思想深邃，语言充分。梭罗写的东西看起来往往完整表达了自己所想。但有时，沉思风格的作者无法传达自己的思想，虽不尽如人意，但已尽力而为。怀特经常这样做，就像他写道：

「可是表达这种性质的东西不太容易。」

其他时候，怀特似乎采取一种极端的立场，认为语言总是无法胜任表达：「一些事情，本来难以形诸笔墨，我偏要描述，未免不自量力，而我果然失败了，我已经料到。但我履行了对社会的义务，此外，身为作家，就像杂技演员，必须勉为其难地尝试些新花样。」

#### 1.5.5 Classic Style Is Not Romantic Style

Contemplative style is fundamentally about the writer's thought and often explicitly acknowledges this focus. Romantic style, although not necessarily focused on the writer's thought in the sense of his analysis or reflection, is always and inescapably about the writer. Romantic prose is a mirror, not a window.

Romantic style does not separate thought from sensation, memory, and emotion. All these things together are experience. Neither does romantic style distinguish the person who experiences from the experience. The romantic writer therefore cannot be an observer who sees something separate from himself; both the writer and his experience are inseparable elements of a perpetual dialectic in which the writer creates a world, which in its turn creates him. This process is something like the pulse of life. A writer can describe this dynamic relationship, but cannot「present」it and allow it to be verified.

If contemplative style views writing as an engine of discovery, romantic style looks upon it as an act of creation that both comes from the self and reveals the self.

The narrator of Proust's A la recherche du temps perdu offers a striking description of such an act of romantic creation in his account of his first direct encounter with the Duchesse de Guermantes, a woman who had a large place in his imagination before he had ever seen her. The image he cherished has little to do with her — no one but the narrator himself could validate it in a face-to-face encounter with her — but it reveals a great deal about the narrator:

My disappointment was immense. It arose from my not having borne in mind, when I thought of Mme de Guermantes, that I was picturing her to myself in the colours of a tapestry or a stained-glass window, as living in another century, as being of another substance than the rest of the human race.

At this point, there is a kind of struggle between the classic outlook and the romantic.

. . . I was endeavouring to apply . . . to this fresh and unchanging image, the idea:「It's Mme de Guermantes」; but I succeeded only in making the idea pass between me and the image, as though they were two discs moving in separate planes with a space between.

The Madame de Guermantes whose existence is independent of the narrator's idea of her does not, however, overcome the Madame de Guermantes who is a defining element of his mentality. He says these words to himself silently but distinctly:

「Great and glorious before the days of Charlemagne, the Guermantes had the right of life and death over their vassals; the Duchesse de Guermantes descends from Geneviève de Brabant. She does not know, nor would she consent to know, any of the people who are here to-day.」

His struggle ends with a creative act that allows the narrator to see the romantic truth, one unique to himself, one that could not be shared by anyone else present on the occasion he describes.

. . . my eyes resting upon her fair hair, her blue eyes, the lines of her neck, and overlooking the features which might have reminded me of the faces of other women, I cried out within myself, as I admired this deliberately unfinished sketch:「How lovely she is! What true nobility! It is indeed a proud Guermantes, the descendant of Geneviève de Brabant, that I have before me!」

In contemplative style, which preserves a distinction between observation and the observer's reflections, it is possible to discover something that is outside of the self and not dependent on the writer for its existence. In romantic style, which observes no such distinction, creation replaces discovery and always depends on the writer for its existence.

Classic writing may present personal material as an instance of a more general truth, but it never presents something that is merely personal or in principle private. For romantic style to rule out personal experience or even experience that is in principle private would reduce the romantic writer to silence. In the theology of this style, the only things anyone can know are personal and in principle private.

Classic style never leaves the writer feeling incomplete, unfulfilled, or incompetent. Classic writers can know something, and once they know it, they can say it. Correction and revision are not infinite, because classic style is a craft that can effectively be learned by learning its parts, none of which is idiosyncratic. Thought and language fit, so it is possible to succeed completely in expressing truth. In romantic style, to separate thought and expression or thought and thinker as separate and fixed realities is to make a false division that leads to false conclusions. In the romantic perspective, writing is not a craft that can be learned, because it is an activity co-extensive with the writer's person; it cannot be reduced to discrete modules, separate writing jobs that can be completed one after another. There is no complete fit between thought and language because a writer's thought is not a formed and fixed reality independent of language and capable of being fitted into it.

It is a premise of classic style that truth has been perfectly perceived by the writer. The writer's problem is to articulate that truth perfectly, and in the theology of classic style this problem always has a solution. In romantic style, the writer can know truth romantically and whole, but truth cannot be conceived analytically without a loss of definition, and cannot be put into language without a further loss of definition. In classic style, truth is allied with clarity. In romantic style, clarity can be achieved only at the price of falsification.

Both the classic writer and the romantic writer are vulnerable but in entirely different ways. The classic writer is vulnerable because he speaks noncontingent truth to which everybody is vulnerable. The romantic writer is vulnerable because everybody is vulnerable to the conditions of life. The classic writer is always vulnerable to challenge; the romantic writer never. When the romantic writer says he dreams of Jeanie with the light brown hair, he yearns for her, he sighs for her, who can check to see whether it is true? He cannot be told he is wrong, for he stands in a special place, with incorrigible knowledge about his entirely private and personal subject matter. If he is wrong, his error is built into the human condition, so no human being can correct him. But the classic writer can be told that he is wrong, because the truth he presents is available to everyone, and can be tested by anyone.

Of the styles we have discussed, classic and romantic are furthest apart: they take strong fundamentally irreconcilable stands on every one of the elements of style. The distinction between them is as absolute as the distinction Demetrius saw between the restrained and the elevated. The classic stand on the elements of style is not always opposed in all particulars to the stands of other styles. Between classic style and practical style is an agreement that language is sufficient to express knowable truths. Between classic style and contemplative style is at least a channel for discussion: at least sometimes, truth can be known and language can express it. Between classic style and plain style is a gradient of conceptual refinement. But classic style and romantic style represent irreconcilable conceptual stands. There is no common ground between them, no gradient from one to the other; instead there is something like a permanent and impassable divide.

1.5.5 古典风格不是浪漫风格

沉思风格认为最重要的是作者的沉思，通常也大大方方承认这一点。浪漫风格的关注点虽然不一定是作者的分析或思考，却总是避不开作者。浪漫风格的文章是一面镜子，而非一扇窗户。

浪漫风格的思想离不开感受、记忆和情绪。这些东西共同形成体验。在浪漫风格中，体验本身和体验的人息息相关。因此浪漫风格作者看到的事物无法脱离自身而存在；作者和他的体验是一对不可分割的持续辩证因素：作者创造了一个世界，反过来这个世界又创造了他。这个过程仿佛生命的律动。作者可以描述这种动态关系，但无法「呈现」它，也无法被读者验证。

如果沉思风格把写作视为发现的引擎，浪漫风格则把它看作一种创造行为，两者都源于自身，又揭示自身。

在普鲁斯特《追忆似水年华》这本书中，叙述者讲述的一次初遇，完美诠释了这种浪漫的创造行为，他初遇的是一位未曾谋面就已令他魂牵梦绕的盖尔芒特公爵夫人。他心里珍藏的形象与她本人毫无关系 —— 只有叙述者本人与她面对面相遇才可能验证 —— 但这透露了很多与叙述者相关的信息。

我失望得很。失望在于我万万没有预料到她会是这样的：过去一想到盖尔芒特夫人，我总是用挂毯或彩色玻璃窗的色调在心中描绘她的形象，把她想象成另一世纪的模样，举止气派与活生生的人完全不同。① 19

① 汉译文出自李恒基译《追忆似水年华》第一部第一卷「贡布雷」，本书其他《追忆似水年华》选段均出自该翻译版本。—— 译者注

在这点上，古典视角和浪漫视角彼此对立。

…...我努力…...给这个全新的、不可改变的形象粘贴上如下的说明：「这位就是德-盖尔芒特夫人。」然而我却不能使这样的认识同形象妥帖地相合，它们像两只隔着空档的圆盘，始终转不到一起。

真实存在的盖尔芒特夫人独立于叙述者的思想，然而并没有动摇他想象出来的盖尔芒特夫人。他心里的自言自语如此清晰：

盖尔芒特家早在查理大帝之前就声名显赫，对手下的属臣拥有生杀之权：盖尔芒特夫人是热纳为耶夫-德-布拉邦特的后代。她不认识、也不想认识这里的任何人。

他最后用一种创造性的行为抚慰这种挣扎，叙述者可以由此看到浪漫的真相，但只有他自己看得到，别的任何人处在他所描述的场合都无法看到。

…...我的日光注视她的金黄色的头发，她的蓝眼晴和她的脖子，由此排除了可能使我想到别人容貌的一切特征，看着这幅有意画得不完全的速写稿，我不禁叫出声来：「她多美呀！多雍容华贵！她准是盖尔芒特家的一位高做的夫人，热纳维耶夫德-布拉邦特的后代！」

在沉思风格中，作者会区分他的观察和思考，所以可能发现自身之外且不依附于作者而存在事物。浪漫风格没有这种区分，创造取代了发现，且往往依附于作者而存在。

古典写作可以把个人化的东西呈现出更普遍的真相，但它不会呈现纯粹个人化的或原则上私密的东西。浪漫风格作者如果不写个人体验或甚至说得上私密的体验，他就没有什么可说的了。这种风格秉持的信仰是，人只能知道个人化或原则上私密的东西。

古典风格从来不会让作者感觉有什么不完全、未实现或不胜任的地方。古典风格作者可以知道一些事情，一旦他们知道，他们就能把它表达出来。不会没完没了地纠正和改善，因为古典风格是一种可以通过分块学习提高效率的技艺，没有哪个部分是个人特有的。思想和语言能相互匹配，所以完全可能表达真相。在浪漫风格中，把思想和表达或者把思想和思考者分成独立而确定的现实，这种错误的划分方式只会带来错误的结论。在浪漫风格看来，写作不是学出来的技艺，因为它是一种与作者本人共生的活动；它无法简化成独立的模块，一步步完成写作任务。思想和语言不可能完全匹配，因为作者的思想不是成型且确定的现实，不能独立于语言，也没有合适的语言可以表达。

作者已经完全洞察到真相是古典风格的前提条件。作者的问题是如何完美地表达那个真相，而在古典风格的信仰中，这个问题总有解决办法。在浪漫风格中，作者可以用一种浪漫的方式了解完整的真相，但用一种分析眼光看待的真相不可能不失真，用语言表达出来必然也会进一步失真。在古典风格中，不清晰无真相。在浪漫风格中，清晰的代价是不真实。

古典风格作者和浪漫风格作者都是脆弱的，但他们是两种不同的脆弱。古典风格作者脆弱是因为他说的是人人都可以看到的必然真相。浪漫风格作者脆弱是因为每个人的生活状况各有不同。古典风格作者总是经受检验；浪漫风格作者从来都不会。当浪漫风格作者说他梦见了珍妮和她浅棕色的头发，为她感怀，为她叹息，谁能验证它的真假？你不能跟他说他错了，因为他站在一个特殊位置，他的主题内容是完全私人和个人化的东西，只有他个人知道。如果他错了，他的错误是人本身的局限所致，因此没有人可以纠正他。但古典风格作者错了可以被人们纠正，因为他呈现的真相任何人都能看到和检验。

我们前面讨论的风格中，与古典风格相差最大的是浪漫风格：它们对每种风格要素采取的立场鲜明对立。两者的殊别就像德米特里眼中的矜持风格和庄严风格，完全不能兼容。对风格元素的立场，古典风格并非总是与其他风格完全对立。古典风格和实用风格都认为语言能够表达可知的真相。古典风格与沉思风格之间至少有一定程度的相通之处：至少某些时候，真相能被人们知道，语言也能表达真相。古典风格与平实风格是一种由浅及深的概念提炼。但古典风格与浪漫风格的概念立场完全对立。两者没有共同基础，也不是由浅及深的递进关系；相反，彼此之间似乎有某种永远无法跨越的鸿沟。

#### 1.5.6 Classic Style Is Not Prophetic Style

Despite a shared affinity for unqualified assertion, classic style has little in common with prophetic or oracular style because prophetic style cannot place the reader where the writer is. The reader cannot verify through his own experience what the writer experiences. Classic style does not depend upon powers that are divine or that are available only to special people, or powers whose availability is subject to some agency that human beings do not control or understand. Prophetic style, on the other hand, depends entirely upon such powers. The ability of the prophetic writer to know truth has come through powers that are not part of the usual human complement. Even their possessor does not possess them reliably: these powers come and go in ways that he does not understand or control.

In Western culture, the best-known examples of prophetic style are in the Old Testament. When the sons of Jesse come before Samuel, the eldest, Eliab, makes an immediate impression on the aging judge, who concludes,「Here, before the Lord, is his anointed king.」It is a response that stands for human insight and wisdom; it is the judgment of a wise and experienced person. Any reader who knows what Samuel knows would presumably share his view of Eliab. But in the model scene of the prophetic style, human judgment does not and cannot share the sacred perspective, even though it can, through a privileged channel, receive the fruit of divine wisdom. The Lord responds to Samuel:「Take no account of it if he is handsome and tall; I reject him. The Lord does not see as man sees; men judge by appearances but the Lord judges by the heart.」

One of the most famous representations of the model scene of prophetic style occurs in the opening chapter of the Book of Jeremiah. The passage begins with the archetypical claim of the prophetic writer, that he is not speaking in his own voice and not conveying his own judgments.「The Word of the Lord came to me.」It then passes on to a dialogue between the Word of God and the inarticulate Jeremiah.

「Before I formed you in the womb . . . I appointed you a prophet to the nations.」

「Ah! Lord God,」I answered,「I do not know how to speak; I am only a child.」. . . Then the Lord stretched out his hand and touched my mouth, and said to me,「I put my words into your mouth. This day I give you authority over nations and over kingdoms, to pull down and to uproot, to destroy and to demolish, to build and to plant.」

The equally famous representation of the calling of Isaiah establishes the same points although they run the risk of being lost in the fabulous vision in which they are embedded. The prophet inexplicably finds himself in the realm of the divine, where he does not belong. (「Woe is me! I am lost, for I am a man of unclean lips. . . .」) But his deficiency is miraculously removed and「unclean lips」are made capable of speaking divine words. He volunteers his services as a messenger and receives his commission:「Go and tell this people. . . .」

The poet, painter, engraver, and printer William Blake is one of the few widely admired modern writers to make extensive use of prophetic style in something like its prototypical form. But prophetic style is not confined to the sacred literature of ancient Israel or an occasional genius-crackpot like Blake. It has its modern form on all those occasions in which a writer claims to be a channel for impersonal and normally inaccessible truth. The writer makes claims to authority, but not his own authority and not the kind of authority that is available to others.「History tells us」(and, tacitly,「I am history's spokesman」) is a common anthem of politicians and of those mysterious channels of wisdom who write opinion columns in newspapers; prophetic style is used by jurists who on occasion claim to speak the judgment of principles or of long-dead foundation jurists; it is the style of all those innumerable spokesmen who tell us what「tradition,」「common sense,」or「common decency」demand and of those slightly less numerous spokesmen who tell us what fashions state or what eras or epochs tell us.

1.5.6 古典风格不是先知风格

古典风格与先知风格或者说神谕风格都要求绝对的肯定，尽管如此，两者几乎没有共同的地方，因为先知风格无法把读者放到作者所在的位置。作者体验的东西，读者无法通过自己的体验验证。古典风格依靠的不是神的力量，或非凡之人才能获得的力量，或非人类所能控制、非人类所能理解的力量。而先知风格完全取决于这些力量。先知风格作者能掌握真相，借助的是非常人能及的力量。甚至他获得了力量，也不代表就能长期拥有它们：这些力量怎么到他身上又怎么消失的，他自己都不理解，也不能控制。

在西方文化中，先知风格最著名的例子是《（圣经〉旧约》（Old Testament）。当耶西的儿子们来到撒母耳面前，大儿子以利押给年迈的审判官留下了直接印象，他断言道：「这就是他，你起来膏他。」① 20 这是一个代表人类洞见与智慧的回答；这是一个聪明老练之人的判断。任何读者如果知道撒母耳所知道的，可能会对以利押有同样看法。但是，在先知风格的典型场景中，人类的判断不会出现也不可能出现这种神圣的视角，虽然可以通过某种特许渠道接收神圣智慧的果实。耶和华对撒母耳说：「不要看他的外貌和他身材高大，我不拣选他。因为耶和华不像人看人，人是看外貌，耶和华是看内心。」21

① 汉译文出自「现代标点和合本」（CUVMP Simplified），本书其他《圣经》选段均出自该翻译版本。—— 译者注

最能代表先知风格典型场景的著名文本之一是《耶利米书》（The Book of Jeremiah）的开篇章节。文章开头采用了先知风格作者的典型口吻，他不是用自己的声音说话，也不是表达自己的见解。「耶和华的话临到我说。」22 然后转到耶和华与不善言辞的耶利米之间的谈话：

我未将你造在腹中…... 我已派你做列国的先知。

我就说：「主耶和华啊！我不知怎样说，因为我是年幼的。」...… 于是耶和华伸手按我的口，对我说，「我已将当说的话传给你。看哪，我今日立你在列邦列国之上，为要施行拔出、拆毁、毁坏、倾覆，又要建立、栽植。」

以赛亚使命也是典型的先知风格场景，证实了相同的观点，尽管这些观点通过传说中的神示表达出来可能难以理解。先知莫名地发现自己在一个神圣领地，他不属于的地方。（「祸哉，我灭亡了。因为我是嘴唇不洁的人」22）但他的缺陷奇迹般地消除了，「不洁的嘴唇」也能说出圣洁的话。他自告奋勇担任信使服务百姓，并接受对他的委托：「你去告诉这百姓说…...」。

广泛使用类似典型形式表达先知风格的现代作家屈指可数，身兼诗人、画家、雕刻家与版画家的威廉·布菜克（William Blake）是其中少数几个被众口称赞的作家之一。但先知风格不限于古代以色列的神圣文学，也不专属于布菜克这样少见的天才怪人。它有现代的表现形式，常见于一些自称是客观真相的传播者的作者，知道一般人无法知道的真相。作者拥有权威，但这权威不是自己，也非常人可及。政治家和那些以神秘的智慧传达者身份写报纸评论专栏的作家，总喜欢说「历史告诉我们」（或「我是历史的发言人」）；法学家有时也会用先知风格声明审判的依据源于某些准则或某位已故的法学奠基人；还有数不清的代言人用这种风格告诉我们怎么样做才符合「传统」「常识」或「基本礼仪」，也有不少代言人用这种风格告诉我们时尚是什么，或者时代或年代的启示是什么。

#### 1.5.7 Classic Style Is Not Oratorical Style

The central model for most discussions of rhetoric in classical antiquity seems to be oratory. Even when something is written — rather than spoken — in an oratorical style and meant to be read silently by one individual, its effects are meant for the ear. The text may be written down formally in sentences, but its units are periods and are defined by sound.

The model scene of oratorical style is neither casual nor spontaneous. Its prototypical occasion is the assembly of a group of people faced by a public problem — like military invasion, the forming and maintenance of public values, or the judging of social offenders.

This scene creates a cast. Leadership is necessary, and the assembly's job is to respond to a candidate who puts himself forward. The orator assumes a role as leader of both the public moment and the setting of policy. He invites the audience to yield to his rhythms and to his views, which he typically presents as a version of common verities. The audience may coalesce and perhaps join in as his chorus, or remain splintered and perhaps heckle him randomly. The successful orator molds the audience into one body with one voice and one governing view. To the outsider, he may appear to be alternatively a demagogue with an echo or the selfless conductor of the common music.

In a slight variant of this model scene and cast, the audience has as its head a judge or perhaps a king who rules on policy under advice from the full audience. When Odysseus debates with Akhilleus over the best time for the Akhaians to engage the Trojans on the field of war, the judge is High King Agamemnon, but the entire council is the audience with Agamemnon at its head. Akhilleus, who wants to avenge immediately the slaying of Patroclos, vents his anger and represents his singularity:

Let us recover joy of battle soon, that's all!

No need to dither here and lose our time,

our great work still undone. When each man sees

Akhilleus in a charge, crumpling the ranks

of Trojans with his bronze-shod spear, let each

remember that is the way to fight his man!

Odysseus, by far the better orator, isolates Akhilleus by assuming for himself the role of defender and spokesman of the audience, thereby making it natural for the audience to identify with him and his views:

Brave as you are, and like a god in looks,

Akhilleus, do not send Akhaian soldiers

into the fight unfed! Today's mêlée

will not be brief, when rank meets rank, and heaven

breathes fighting spirit into both contenders.

No, tell all troops who are near the ships to take

roast meat and wine, for heart and staying power.

No soldier can fight hand to hand, in hunger,

all day long until the sun goes down!

Though in his heart he yearns for war, his legs

go slack before he knows it: thirst and famine

search him out, and his knees fail as he moves.

But that man stayed with victualing and wine

can fight his enemies all day: his heart

is bold and happy in his chest, his legs

hold out until both sides break off the battle!

Come, then, dismiss the ranks to make their breakfast.

Since oratory is designed to unite many listeners, whose attention may flag, it cannot be either very flexible or very subtle. Nuance is always risky with such an audience. Consequently, the surface of oratory usually looks like a few points with the help of a lot of music. Going along with the music helps the audience go along with the points, as Kenneth Burke has remarked in A Rhetoric of Motives:

[W]e know that many purely formal patterns can readily awaken an attitude of collaborative expectancy in us. For instance, imagine a passage built about a set of oppositions (「we do this, but they on the other hand do that; we stay here; but they go there; we look up, but they look down,」etc.) Once you grasp the trend of the form, it invites participation regardless of the subject matter. Formally, you will find yourself swinging along with the succession of antitheses, even though you may not agree with the proposition that is being presented in this form. Or it may even be an opponent's proposition which you resent — yet for the duration of the statement itself you might「help him out」to the extent of yielding to the formal development, surrendering to its symmetry as such. Of course, the more violent your original resistance to the proposition, the weaker will be your degree of「surrender」by「collaborating」with the form. But in cases where a decision is still to be reached, a yielding to the form prepares for assent to the matter identified with it. Thus, you are drawn to the form, not in your capacity as a partisan, but because of some「universal」appeal in it. And this attitude of assent may then be transferred to the matter which happens to be associated with the form.

Burke, in writing this passage, surely had in mind Pericles' Funeral Oration, as reconstructed by Thucydides, in which Pericles attempts to guide the Athenians at a difficult historical moment in their sense of communal values by offering them an image of themselves that just happens coincidentally to serve Pericles' own purposes. In this oration, which takes place at the end of the first year of the Peloponnesian War, Pericles follows the model of Odysseus in the debate with Akhilleus. Like Odysseus, Pericles casts himself in the role of spokesman for the audience. His oration has as its most central and famous parts a series of explicit and implicit contrasts between the Athenians and citizens of rival cities:

Our love of what is beautiful does not lead to extravagance; our love of the things of the mind does not make us soft. We regard wealth as something to be properly used, rather than as something to boast about. As for poverty, no one need be ashamed to admit it: the real shame is not taking practical measures to escape from it. Here each individual is interested not only in his own affairs but in the affairs of the state as well. . . . We are capable at the same time of taking risks and of estimating them beforehand. Others are brave out of ignorance; and, when they stop to think, they begin to fear. But the man who can most truly be accounted brave is he who best knows the meaning of what is sweet in life and of what is terrible, and then goes out undeterred to meet what is to come.

Later, after the plague and the second invasion of Athenian land by the Peloponnesians, the Athenians grow angry at Pericles. To defuse their anger, he summons them to Assembly and revives the oratorical theme of the previous Funeral Oration:

No doubt all this will be disparaged by people who are politically apathetic; but those who, like us, prefer a life of action will try to imitate us, and, if they fail to secure what we have secured, they will envy us. All who have taken it upon themselves to rule over others have incurred hatred and unpopularity for a time; but if one has a great aim to pursue, this burden of envy must be accepted, and it is wise to accept it. Hatred does not last for long; but the brilliance of the present is the glory of the future stored up for ever in the memory of man. It is for you. . . . Do not send embassies to Sparta: do not give the impression that you are bowed down under your present sufferings! To face calamity with a mind as unclouded as may be, and quickly to react against it — that, in a city and in an individual, is real strength.

The contrasts between oratorical style and classic style can be illustrated right from this text of Thucydides. He comments on Pericles' oratory in a style whose impulses served as a prototype for the inventors of classic style:

In this way Pericles attempted to stop the Athenians from being angry with him and to guide their thoughts in a direction away from their immediate sufferings. So far as public policy was concerned, they accepted his argument, sending no more embassies to Sparta and showing an increased energy in carrying on the war; yet as private individuals they still felt the weight of their misfortunes. The mass of the people had had little enough to start with and had now been deprived of even that; the richer classes had lost their fine estates with their rich and well-equipped houses in the country, and, which was the worst thing of all, they were at war instead of living in peace. In fact, the general ill feeling against Pericles persisted, and was not satisfied until they had condemned him to pay a fine. Not long afterwards, however, as is the way with crowds, they re-elected him to the generalship and put all their affairs into his hands. By that time people felt their own private sufferings rather less acutely and, so far as the general needs of the state were concerned, they regarded Pericles as the best man they had. . . . He survived the outbreak of war by two years and six months, and after his death his foresight with regard to the war became even more evident. For Pericles had said that Athens would be victorious if she bided her time and took care of her navy, if she avoided trying to add to the empire during the course of the war, and if she did nothing to risk the safety of the city itself. But his successors did the exact opposite, and in other matters which apparently had no connection with the war private ambition and private profit led to policies which were bad both for the Athenians themselves and for their allies.

The roles adopted by Pericles the orator and Thucydides the classic writer differ sharply. Pericles leads a group but Thucydides merely presents something to the reader. Pericles is interested but Thucydides disinterested. Pericles is the conductor of the rhythm of the crowd but Thucydides is merely talking in his natural voice. Pericles wants something from his audience but Thucydides does not. Pericles asserts and advises but Thucydides merely observes. Pericles is formal, Thucydides casual. Pericles speaks in a public occasion but Thucydides is telling the reader something spontaneously. Pericles affirms common wisdom, but Thucydides operates at all moments as an independent thinker. Pericles expects his audience to notice his oratory while Thucydides pretends that his prose is transparent. Pericles asks his audience to look harder to see what needs seeing, while Thucydides is simply pointing out something that is obvious once presented. Of course, in fact, Thucydides' supposed historical account is a relentless argument about the nature of crowds and democracies, but he presents his conclusions the same way one might point out the first turning of the leaves in fall, as a fact, although a subtle fact. It is a characteristic strength of classic style to persuade by default. The classic writer offers no explicit argument at all. Ostensibly, he offers simply a presentation. If the reader fails to recognize that the ostensible presentation is a device of persuasion, then he is persuaded without ever realizing that an argument has occurred. It is always easier to persuade an audience unaware of the rhetorician's agenda.

The differences between the oratorical and classic models of speech are considerable because oratory and the writing styles based on it have a lot of practical work to do. These oratorical styles cannot concern themselves with thought exclusively or even mainly. They have not merely to keep an audience made up of many individuals attentive and alert but also to take a heterogeneous group of individuals and mold them into a unified body directed at action or the making of policy for action. They make use of what the audience already thinks much more than they introduce new observations or refine old ones.

1.5.7 古典风格不是演说风格

古典时期大部分修辞论述的主要模式是演说。如果一篇文章写成演说风格，尽管是书面表达 —— 不是口头演说 —— 且读者只是一个人默读，也是为了产生震撼耳朵的乐感。文本的句子可能写得很正式，但它的单元都是乐句，而且由声音定义。

演说风格的典型场景既不是非正式的，也不是即兴的。它的典型场合是一群人因为面临某个公共问题聚集在一起 —— 如军事入侵，树立和维护公共价值观，判决社会罪犯等。

这个场景创造了一种角色。领导人必不可少，而群体的任务是响应主动站出来的候选人。演说者担任的是领导人角色，他既是现场公众的领导者，也是制定政策的领导者。他邀请听众响应他的节奏和主张，通常他会把这种主张表现成某种大家共有的信念。听众可能联合起来，也许加入响应他的队伍或者独立出来，也许还会随意冲他起哄。成功的演说者把听众联合成一个整体，只有同一种声音，同一种信念。在外人的眼中，他可能看起来像一位煽动民情的政客，又或者是演奏同一首音乐的无私指挥家。

这种典型场景与角色可以稍做改变，听众的领导者是一名法官，或者也许是一位国王，他要根据全体听众的意见决定政策。当奥德修斯（Odysseus）与阿喀琉斯（Akhilleus）对阿喀琉斯进攻特洛伊的最佳时机争论不休时，法官是至高的阿伽门农王（High King Agamemnon），但整个委员会是阿伽门农领导的听众。阿喀琉斯恨不得立即为死去的帕特罗克洛斯（Patroclos）复仇，他满腔愤怒，表现得与众不同：

现在我们应该考虑

出战的事情，不能在这里空发议论，

把时间耽误：伟大的事情还未完成。

让大家看见阿喀琉斯重新参战，

挥舞铜枪无情地杀戮特洛亚军队，愿你们每个人也这样勇猛地杀戮敌人。① 23

奥德修斯在演说上技高一筹，通过扮演守卫者和听众代言人的角色孤立阿喀琉斯，听众则自然而然地认同他和他的主张。他说：

「神样的阿喀琉斯，不管你如何勇敢，

也不能让未早餐的阿开奥斯人去伊利昂

同特洛伊人厮杀，因为战斗不可能

短时间结束，当双方的战线开始接触，

神明向交战双方灌输同样的力量。

还是首先让阿开奥斯人快到船边

用点酒饭，酒饭会给人勇气和力量。

一个人不可能空着肚子整天不断地

同敌人作战，一直杀到太阳下山。

即使他心中很想顽强地坚持战斗，

但他的肢节会突然疲软，饥饿和焦渴

一同袭来，抬动两腿会觉得力乏。

如果一个人喝够了酒，吃饱了饭，

他便能够同敌人整天连续厮杀，胸中的心力勇猛不衰，全身肢节坚韧不乏，最后一个停止作战。

你现在应该解散军队，让他们用餐。」23

① 汉译文出自王焕生翻译版本，本书其他《伊利亚特》选段均出自该翻译版本。—— 译者注

因为演讲的目的是把听众团结起来，避免他们注意力涣散，所以演讲不宜过多变化，也不宜过于晦涩。不宜向这类听众阐述太多细节。因此，表面上看起来演说通常是少数观点附和着大量音乐。跟随音乐的节奏，有助于听众认同演讲者的观点，正如肯尼斯·伯克（Kenneth Burke）在《动机修辞学）(A Rhetoric of Motives）中写道：

我们知道，许多纯粹形式上的模式，容易唤起我们内在的预期合作态度。例如，想象一篇文章一系列对立的句子（「我们做这个，但他们做那个；我们待在这里，但他们去那里；我们向上看，但他们向下看。」等等）。一旦你理解了这种形式趋势，无论主题是什么，它都会吸引你参与进来。你会发现自己沉浸在一种连续的对比形式中，即使你可能不认同通过这种形式提出的主张。或者它甚至可能是你不喜欢的反对者提出的主张一然而因为叙述本身的持续性，你可能为了「帮他摆脱困境」，会逐渐认同这种形式上的递进，屈服于它的这类对称形式。当然，起初你对这种主张反抗越强烈，你就越不愿意「屈服」，越不会与这种形式「合作」。但是在决定还未达成的时候，对形式的屈服会使人们逐渐认同与之密切相关的内容。所以，你被形式吸引，不是因为你是虔诚的信徒，而是因为它内在的一些「普遍」吸引力。这种认同的态度，可能会迁移到和形式相关的内容上。24

伯克在写这段话时，脑子里想的一定是修昔底德修编的《伯里克利的葬礼演说》（Pericles'Funeral Oration），伯里克利试图用这场演说引导危在旦夕的雅典人民理解公共价值观，于是为他们描绘了他们自身的一种形象，这种形象又恰恰有利于伯里克利实现自己的目的。这篇演说发生在伯罗奔尼撒战争第一年的年末，当时的伯里克利效仿了奥德修斯与阿喀琉斯辩论的模式。像奥德修斯一样，伯里克利扮演了听众的代言人。在他的演说中，最重要最著名的部分是对雅典人民与敌城人民所做的一系列明确又含蓄的对比：

我们热爱美的事物但不至于奢侈，热爱智慧但不至于柔弱。我们把财富当作是可以适当利用的东西，而不是当作可以夸耀的东西，真正的耻辱不是贫穷这一事实本身，而是不千方百计地去摆脱贫穷。我们的公职人员，在关注公共事务的同时，还关注自己的私人事务… 我们在从事冒险事业之前或冒险事业之中，能够做到既敢于冒险，又深思熟虑。其他人的勇敢，是由于他们的无知，当他们反思的时候，又会感到疑惧了。但是，真正勇敢的人无疑应属于那些最清醒地认识人生的灾患和幸福而又勇往直前，在危难面前从不退缩的人。① 25

① 汉译文出自徐松岩翻译版本，本书其他《伯罗奔尼撒战争史》选段均出自该翻译版本。—— 译者注

后来，随着瘟疫爆发和伯罗奔尼撒人第二次入侵雅典土地，雅典人开始怨恨伯里克利。为了平息他们的愤怒，他把民众召集到一起，延续先前的「葬礼演说」主题：

那些没有雄心壮志的人会对这些光荣提出非难，但是那些积极行动的人会努力仿效我们，如果他们没有我们这样幸运的话，他们会忌妒我们的。所有渴望统治别人的人，都会暂时招致别人的仇恨，会不得人心的。但是追求最崇高的目标的人必然招致憎恨，因此而招致憎恨的人是真正聪明的人。招致憎恨也是暂时的，但是由此而产生的目前的显耀和将来的光荣会使人们永世难忘的。因此，你们…...不要派使者前往拉栖代梦，不要表露出任何一点这样的迹象，表明你们在目前的灾祸面前低头了。因为只有那些在心态上最冷静对待灾难的人们，只有那些在行动上最快速解除灾难的人们，才是最杰出的人、最伟大的公民集体。25

修昔底德下面这段话可以说明演说风格和古典风格的差异。他评论伯里克利演说所用的风格的动力，为发明古典风格的人提供了原型：

这就是伯里克利试图平息雅典人对他的怒气，引导他们从思想上摆脱现在的痛苦所列举的论据。他们作为一个公民集体被伯里克利成功地说服了，他们不仅不再考虑派使者去拉栖代梦和谈，同时还对战争投入更大的力量。但作为个人，他们在灾难面前还是不堪重负的。普通民众原来仅有的那一点点财产，如今也被剥夺了，上层阶级丧失了他们在乡村的美丽的田园和设施优良、富丽堂皇的房舍：最糟糕的是他们生活在战争中，而不是在和平中。事实上，对伯里克利的恶感还是普遍存在，直到他们判处伯里克利缴纳一笔罚款。可是，不久以后，按照民众办事的一贯方式，他们又选举他为将军，把他们的一切事务都交给他处理，现在，他们对于个人的和家庭的灾难的感受没有那么强烈了，以邦国公共需要而论，他们认为伯里克利是所有的人当中最有才能的人。因为在和平时期，只要他担任城邦的首脑，他就追求一种温和的、稳健的政策，他执政的时代正是雅典的全盛时代。战争爆发的时候，他似乎也准确估计了雅典的军事实力。战争开始后的两年半他才去世。他去世以后，他对战争的某些正确的预见更加为人所知。伯里克利告诫雅典人说，如果雅典静待时机，关注自己的海军，不再去征服新的领土，并且在战争中不使雅典城发生危险的话，他预计雅典是会赢得这场战争的。但是，雅典人的行动却恰恰相反，在一些显然与战争毫不相千的事务上，个人野心和私人利益导致了一些对雅典人自已和他们的同盟者都不利的政策。

伯里克利是演说家，修昔底德是古典作家，两个人的角色完全不同。伯里克利领导一群人，而修昔底德只是向读者呈现事情。伯里克利有利可图，而修昔底德无私可谋。伯里克利指挥着群众的节奏，而修昔底德只是用他自然的语调说话。伯里克利对听众有所期待，而修昔底德没有。伯里克利总是断言和建议，而修昔底德只是观察。伯里克利是正式讲话，而修昔底德只是闲谈。伯里克利是在公众场合演讲，而修昔底德只是即兴告诉读者某件事。伯里克利宣扬共同智慧，而修昔底德在任何时候都是一名独立的思考者。伯里克利希望他的听众注意他的雄辩言辞，而修昔底德假装他的文章透明无形。伯里克利要求他的听众努力看需要看的东西，而修昔底德只是指出一旦呈现出来就显而易见的事物。当然，事实上，修昔底德所谓的历史叙述，是对群众与民主的性质的有力论证，但他呈现结论的方式，犹如人们可以指出秋天的叶子第一次转变颜色，虽然这是一个不易察觉的事实。不知不觉中说服他人是古典风格特有的优势。古典风格作者没有明显论证什么。表面上看，他只是呈现而已。如果读者没看出这种假托的呈现是一种说服手段，那他还没意识到有论证时就被说服了。避免听众察觉到修辞家的意图，则更容易说服听众。

演说风格和古典风格的说话方式完全不同，因为这种风格的演讲和写作有很多实际工作要做。这些演说风格不会只专注思想，甚至也不会把思想放在第一位。演说风格不仅要维持这许许多多个人组成的听众的注意力，还要带领这些各色各样的人团结一致，引导他们行动或为行动制定政策。这些风格更多的是利用听众已有的想法，而不是引入新观点或升华旧观点。

### 1.6 Trade Secrets

Classic writers almost never discuss the classic stand on the elements of style, not because they want to keep secrets but rather because they take the classic stand to be obvious, needing neither explanation nor justification. But they have no axiomatic prejudice against investigating the classic stand, and there are classic works, such as Descartes's Discourse on Method, that explicitly lay out many of the principles behind it.

These principles constitute what we have called the theology behind the classic stand. The theology is acknowledged even if rarely discussed. But separate from the theology are a few trade secrets, acknowledged neither in the theology nor in the style. The theology can be learned by anyone, but only a classic writer is likely to come to an understanding of how the trade secrets of the style are related to its theology. There are two principal trade secrets: classic style's practical limitations and the ultimate incoherence of its theoretical perspective.

1.6 古典风格的秘密

古典风格作家几乎从不讨论古典风格在风格元素上的立场，不是因为他们要隐藏什么，而是因为他们认为古典立场显而易见，不用解释也无须辩护。但他们不反对进一步考证古典立场，而且有些古典作品，比如笛卡儿的《谈谈方法》，清晰地阐述过古典立场背后的诸多原则。

这些原则构成了我们所说的古典立场背后的信仰。虽然很少讨论，但这种信仰是被认可的。但有些秘密不属于这种信仰，既不被这种信仰认可也不受古典风格认可。人人可以学到这种信仰，但只有古典风格作者才可能理解这种风格的秘密与它的信仰之间的关系。古典风格有两大秘密：古典风格有限的应用范围和无法实现终极统一的理论视角。

#### 1.6.1 Classic Style Is Inadequate

There are theorems in mathematics — such as Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem, the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, and Wedderburn's Theorem (「A finite division ring is a field」) — that count as high art because of their elegance and purity. Their proofs move deftly and efficiently in clear and irrefutable steps through vast, seemingly incomprehensible landscapes of overwhelming complexity and detail, to bring out at a snap a crisp and powerful truth that is obvious once it is pointed out. As the absolute brilliance of the truth comes into focus, an absolute inevitability, completeness, and perfection accompany it, as if these proofs are not inventions of formal steps but rather the perfect discovery of the clear and simple truth they present. No one would have seen the truth without having seen it presented this way, but once seen, it is seen entirely and recognized absolutely. This is the stereotype of a mathematical proof: brief, efficient, clear, elegant, and pure. Classic style takes such elegance to be not merely normative but universal.

But there are problems in mathematics, like the four-color problem or the traveling salesman problem, that have been treated in a manner that is neither elegant nor pure. They are battles of attrition. The four-color problem, for example, was first solved by a computer program that spent night after night testing possibilities and ruling each out. The conception of this proof is of course extremely clever, but the proof itself, printed out, looks like what it is: the mechanical application of brute force. It is impossible to follow this proof, and no one could keep it all in mind. There is no clear and simple truth for anyone to see. The traveling salesman problem is still susceptible only to approximations and heuristics, again computer-assisted and very untidy. Many of the best mathematical minds of the last three centuries have sought an exact efficient solution to this and related problems, without success, leading to the current suspicion that there is no exact efficient solution. Worse, it is now widely suspected that there is not even an efficient approximate solution. If there is no efficient solution at all, the only approach to these problems is to work at this or that special case, and to leave off short of finality and perfection.

Mathematics acknowledges this situation and has invented many instruments, such as numerical methods, that do not fit the stereotype of brief, simple, and elegant proof. Classic style, on the other hand, acknowledges nothing that does not fit its model of elegance. The theology behind classic style does not admit that there is anything that counts as truth that cannot be presented briefly and memorably. In practice, this simply means that classic style prefers to limit its domain while tacitly claiming universal application.

1.6.1 古典风格并非普遍适用

数学上有些定理因为优美和纯粹被视为高等艺术，比如哥德尔不完全性定理、伽罗瓦理论基本定理及韦德伯恩小定理（每一个有限整环都是域）。它们的证明一步一步推进，清晰且笃定，巧妙又高效，渐次攻克复杂烦琐的谜题，清晰有力的真相忽然之间出现在你面前，一旦指出，如此显然。当真相的光辉毕见无遗，它如此完整又如此完美，看着就非此不可，好像这些证明不是逐步论证的结果，而是呈现清晰简单的真相带来的完美发现。如果不是看到真相用这种方式展现出来，没人可以看到真相，但一旦看到，就会完整地看到，而且一眼就可以认出来。这就是数学证明的标志特点：简洁、高效、清晰、优雅和纯粹。古典风格认为这种优雅不仅是一种标准，而且普遍存在。

但是有一些数学问题，比如四色定理或者旅行商问题，它们的解决方式既不优雅也不纯粹。它们是消耗战。比如，四色定理问题最开始是通过一个计算机程序解决的，但要夜以继日地测试各种可能性然后一个个排除。能想到这种证明方式当然很聪明，但是证明过程本身，如果打印出来看起来就像它自己的样子：野蛮的机械应用。它的证明过程很难理解，也没人能记得全。这种证明没有呈现清晰简单的真相。至于旅行商问题，到现在也只能用近似法或探索法求解，一样要借助计算机做烦琐的计算。过去三百年来，很多顶尖的数学家尝试为这个问题及其相关问题找到最佳高效解决方案，但都没成功，导致现在有人怀疑根本不存在最佳高效解决方案。更糟糕的是，现在不少人怀疑甚至不存在高效的近似解决方案。如果压根不存在最佳高效解决方案，解决这些问题的唯一方法就是研究这样或那样的特殊案例，排除不确切或不完美的方案。

数学承认存在这种情况并发明了很多工具，比如数值方法，它们就不具备数学证明那简洁、简单和优雅的标志特点。而古典风格，不承认任何不符合它的优雅模型的东西。古典风格背后的信仰不承认无法用简单易记的方式呈现出来的真相。实际上，这恰恰说明古典风格主张普遍适用的同时又限制它的适用范围。

#### 1.6.2 Truth Is Not Mind-Independent

This, the most fundamental trade secret, concerns classic style's conception of truth. The classic stand on the elements of style depends upon a conception of a single objective state of affairs that is「the world」and a writer who sees that world without distortion. Of course, the classic writer has access to that world only through her own mind, but that mind has been cleared of all obstructions. In consequence, what it holds is a perfect and undistorted copy of objective truth.

Descartes formed the model for this view in saying that we can know there is God and that God would not have provided us with minds that are fundamentally deceptive. All error must therefore come from such perversions of our fundamental mental endowment as received opinion and prejudice. What is seen clearly and distinctly by a mind cleansed of perversions must necessarily be true.

The theology behind classic style has at its base this model: truth cannot be known independently of thought, but the thought through which it is known can be perfect. Although truth is never independent of mind, the classic writer can know a truth that can be conceived of as independent of mind, as purely「objective,」because the mind of the classic writer has introduced no distortion. There is no difference, then, between the truth the classic writer knows and the「objective」truth as seen from a God's-eye view, external to any particular mind.

The contemporary philosopher Hilary Putnam describes the view that there is an objective state of affairs that can be known objectively as an externalist perspective「because its favorite point of view is a God's Eye point of view.」

The trade secret, to put it bluntly, is that there is no such perspective available to anyone who is part of the human world. As Putnam says,「There is no God's Eye point of view that we can know or usefully imagine; there are only the various points of view of actual persons reflecting various interests and purposes that their descriptions and theories subserve.」Classic style always assumes that it might as well be standing outside the world of actual persons because the classic writer is above mere personal interest; he has no motive but truth, or at least, his highest and governing motive is truth. The classic perception of truth is a perfect copy of truth.

The trade secret can be expressed as two qualifications to the classic conception of truth. The first qualification is a practical limit: no writer can maintain for long the discipline needed to transcend personal interests and personal situations. The second qualification is an absolute limit: there is in fact no way at all even for the briefest space to know truth or the existence of truth independent of thought. All conceptions of truth and all supposedly true concepts are exactly that — conceptions and concepts.

The conception of truth assumed by classic style is based on what Putnam calls the「copy」theory: what is true corresponds to the mind-independent facts. Classic style cannot be described without recourse to this conception of truth, but the copy theory itself rests on a fundamentally impossible premise. How can we compare what we have thought and expressed in language to a mind-independent reality? How can we be independent of our own minds or have any access to what stands apart from mind? There have been many solutions proposed — they include Descartes's plan of cleansing the rational mind through applying judiciously the instrument of doubt, and the positivist plan of using the scientific method to factor out of theories any merely subjective components. But all such plans still involve human thought as the engine of escape, and it is not possible to escape the human mind through the faculties of the human mind.

It requires only a moment's thought to realize that any writer who claims that his writing is「clear and simple as the truth」is claiming that his access to the truth is essentially independent of his thought. It is a claim that can never be known to be true since, as Putnam says, it is impossible to verify a perfect correspondence (or any correspondence) between two things if we have access to just one of them. The classic writer actually has access only to his own thought. How can someone who has access only to thought check that his thought corresponds to mind-independent truth? It is like expecting someone who knows English but no Chinese to be able to claim that an English translation of a Chinese text is accurate. But the classic stand on the elements of style is always in the position of claiming that the translation is accurate with no access to the original except through the translation. The classic claim rests on impossible conditions — as do all the mature and consistent styles of which we are aware — but despite its internal incoherence, it has enjoyed an exceptionally important role in the way people think.

While it is beyond the scope of this book to consider in detail why such an incoherent view has had such a prominent place in the history of thought — much less to consider sophisticated alternatives to the copy theory — it is worth noting that the copy theory has an unparalleled two-thousand-year career in Western philosophy and has come to seem natural. Putnam thinks that「perhaps most philosophers hold some version of the ‘copy' theory of truth today」and furthermore that before Kant it may be impossible to find even one philosopher who did not hold such a theory. Even for Kant, the existence of some mind-independent reality is in Putnam's phrase「virtually a postulate of reason.」

「It's not what I think, it's what I know.」「See for yourself.」「Ask anyone.」「I would not have believed it if I hadn't seen it for myself.」「This shipment has been checked and verified by trained inspectors.」All of these common expressions are normally understood with the help of a tacit reference to the copy theory. This is one way of suggesting what we think to be the case: classic style is not「classic」for no reason. It is so deeply entrenched in our normal way of looking at the world that the only commonsense alternative seems to be that we just make up the world we see, and every claim is as「true」as every other. Although this dichotomy is naïve, it is commonly accepted as inevitable. On that view, there is only one alternative to the copy theory, and it is so generally unacceptable that the copy theory, warts and all, has been embraced as the only possible protection from chaos.

1.6.2 客观真相依赖主观思想

这个是最核心的秘密，与古典风格对真相这个概念的理解有关。古典风格对风格元素的立场取决于一种认识：事物存在唯一的客观状态即「世界」，而作者能不偏不倚地看待这个世界。古典风格作者当然只能通过自己的大脑认识世界，但那颗大脑已经清除了所有障碍。因此它能完美地复制未被歪曲的客观真相。

笛卡儿提供了这个观点的模型，他说既然我们能知道上帝的存在，上帝就不会赋予我们完全不可信的思想。所有的错误都是因为我们与生俱来的基本思想被曲解为成见和偏见。一个大脑清除了曲解的人看得清楚明白的东西必定是真的。

古典风格背后的信仰正是以这种模型为基础：没有思想就无法看到真相，但看到真相所依靠的思想完美无瑕。尽管真相无法独立于思想，但是古典风格作者知道一种纯粹「客观」的真相，它可以被看作独立于思想，因为古典风格作者没有引进任何曲解。从这点来看，古典风格作者看到的真相，与以「上帝之眼」看到的「客观」真相没有差别，都不是某个人特有的思想。

当代哲学家希拉里·普特南（Hilary Putnam）这样描述该观点，事物有一种客观状态，可以客观地称其为外在主义视角，「因为它最推崇的是一种上帝的眼光」。① 26

① 汉译文出自《理性、真理与历史》童世骏和李光程的合译版本。一一 译者注

坦白说，古典风格的秘密是，只要你是人类社会的一分子，就不可能拥有这种视角。正如普特南所讲，「并不存在我们能知道或能有效地想象的上帝的眼光；存在着的只是现实的人的各种看法，这些现实的人思考着他们的理论或描述为之服务的各种利益和目的」。古典风格的立场总是假定最好站在现实的人的世界之外，因为古典风格作者超越了纯粹的个人利益；他唯一的动机是真相，至少他最高的主导动机是真相。古典风格对真相的观察是对真相的完美复制。

古典风格的秘密也可以说是古典风格真相观念的两个限制条件。第一个是实践上的局限性：没有哪位作者能够一直严守纪律、不顾个人利益和个人处境；第二个是绝对的局限性：事实上，脱离了思想，人类根本就不可能知道真相或真相的存在。所有的真相观念（conceptions）及所有被以为正确的概念（concepts）只是 —— 观念和概念。

2『古典风格真相观念的 2 个局限，做一张任意卡片。（2022-03-20）』—— 已完成

古典风格假定的真相观念是基于普特南所说的「复制」理论：即真相对应独立于思想的事实。没有这种真相观念就没人能描述古典风格，但复制理论本身基于一个根本不可能的前提。我们怎么可能将脑中所想和语言所述之物与独立于思想的事实类比呢？我们怎么可能独立于自己的思想或者知道自己思想之外的事物呢？提出的方案有很多 —— 它们包括笛卡儿的净化方案，借助审慎的怀疑来净化理智的大脑；还有实证主义者的排除方案，运用科学方法从理论看法中排除任何纯粹主观的东西。所有这些方案还是用人类的思想充当逃离引擎，但人不可能通过人类的思想能力逃脱人类的思想。

想想就会意识到，任何作者声称自己写得「像真相一样清晰简单」，就等于声称自己看到的真相完全独立于他的思想。我们永远都无法判断这种说法是真是假，诚如普特南所说，如果我们只知道两个事物中的一个，就不可能验证两者是否完全对应（或某些部分对应）。古典风格作者实际上只知道自己的思想。一个只知道自己思想的人，怎么能核实他的思想与独立于思想的真相一致呢？这就像我们期待一个只会英文不会中文的人断言某个中文文本的英文翻译正确无误一样。但是，古典风格在风格元素上的立场总是声称，不用回溯原文，光看翻译就能判断翻译的正误。古典风格的主张基于不可能实现的条件 —— 这跟所有成熟一致的风格一样 —— 尽管它的内在逻辑不通，但它在人们的思考方式上发挥着十分重要的作用。

虽然本书的重点不是讨论为什么这种自相矛盾的观点能在思想历史上占据如此重要的地位，更别说讨论其他可能替代复制理论的成熟理论了，但值得注意的是，复制理论在西方哲学生涯中有长达两千年的、不可超越的历史，而且看起来理所应当。普特南认为「也许现在大多数哲学家认同某种版本的真相复制理论」，康德之前的哲学家没有谁不认同这个理论。在康德看来，存在某种独立于思想的事实 —— 用普特南的话说 ——「几乎是个合理的假设」。

「这不是我想的，这是我知道的。」「你自己去看。」「随便问什么人。」「要不是我亲眼看到，我也不相信。」「有经验的检查员已经核验过了。」所有这些常见表达，人们一般都能理解，其实是默认参照了复制理论。这从一个侧面支持了我们的观点：古典风格的「古典」是有原因的。这种观点在我们日常看待世界的方式中如此根深蒂固，以至唯一合理的替代理论似乎是，我们只是编造了我们看到的世界，每种看法和任何其他看法一样「真实」。虽然这种看法极端又天真，但普遍认为这是唯一说得通的看法。从这点来看，复制理论只有一种替代理论，而且很多人并不接受，所以综合利弊，只有支持复制理论，才可能避免混乱。

### 1.7 Envoi: Style Is Not Etiquette

This book is meant to be a guide to learning classic style and approaches its subject from the inside out, so to speak. Although it takes for granted that its audience writes in English, the style it discusses is not confined to any particular language. It is a style used by ancient Greek writers such as Thucydides, and it is a style used by a distinguished group of seventeenth-century French writers, most of whom knew no Greek; it is a style used by the French chemist Lavoisier in the eighteenth century, and by the American reporter and press critic A. J. Liebling in the twentieth. The principles this book discusses are a stand on the elements of style, not the foundation of a usage manual of one or more varieties of English. Anyone who has attained competence in any language can learn classic style because the principles of the style are as applicable to Japanese or Bengali as they are to English.

We have tried to distinguish the concept of style from the much broader concept of writing, but it is not easy to prevent two commonplace American conflations: style with writing, and writing with English. Most Americans learn to write in English courses, and surveys have shown that what most people mean by English is, first, spelling and then, usage (「can and may,」「affect and effect,」「imply and infer,」and so on through a list of indefinite length).

In addition to books treating fundamental aspects of writing, there is a large and ever-growing number of what amount to etiquette books on conventions of usage and other surface features that proceed from the tacit assumption that someone who masters all these points of etiquette will be able to write「English.」This assumption is a corollary of the thesis that knowing something consists of knowing surface details.

Consider a couple of almost universally effective put-downs based on this assumption.「How on earth can X know anything about epistemology? He can't even spell it!」The equivalent dismissal for spoken language is:「What can Y possibly know about Degas? She can't even pronounce his name!」These are almost invariably effective lines, even though neither has any merit. It is perfectly possible to know a great deal about anything anyone cares to name without being able to spell it or pronounce it according to a prevailing convention.

We will not say it is absolutely impossible to learn to write what will pass for standard English by learning everything in an etiquette book about current conventions in spelling and by consistently distinguishing「allusion」from「illusion」and making similar distinctions between all the other sets of terms frequently confused. But it is a most unlikely procedure, being something like Malcolm X's attempt to attain literacy by memorizing a dictionary. The problem is that anyone seeking to learn something about writing from an etiquette book — and dictionaries are one kind of linguistic etiquette book — remains forever passive to its advice; there is no set of principles to grasp that can ever make such a person independent of the etiquette book. Consider that a competent speaker of English will never make a mistake about fundamental word order: it really is impossible for such a speaker to be uncertain about whether to say「Pass me the molasses」or「Me molasses pass the,」but the same speaker may never be confident of spelling「molasses」correctly even if he becomes editor in chief of a newspaper or a professor of English.

What gives a writer command of a style is not mere correctness; even if an essay, a letter, a report, or a book is completely「correct,」it may also be completely incoherent; it may entirely fail to accomplish what its writer has set out to do. The performance, if merely correct, even should it work, can never be more than an isolated success that leaves no permanent trace. Charles de Gaulle once startled his hosts on a state visit to Moscow by delivering a speech in quite correct and intelligible Russian. Until then, he had not been known to speak the language. Intelligence services in several countries were embarrassed by their apparent lapse in gathering information about his linguistic range, until they found out that they had been right all along. He really did not speak Russian; he merely had been coached to pronounce the Russian words correctly, group them in an apparently thoughtful way by memorizing a tape, and deliver them with appropriate inflection through the same device. It was an actor's trick skillfully carried off. The performance was sensational, but it did not make de Gaulle a Russophone; he remained completely incompetent in the language.

This little book does not offer itself as a short cut to the impossible goal of learning to write English or any other language. It does not aim for something as vague as excellence in a skill as indefinite as writing English. It aims for the eminently possible goal of perfect understanding in a much more definite domain: classic style, with a local application to English. The first goal,「writing English,」is as much a mirage as perfect spelling; the second goal, writing classic prose, is as attainable as correct word order. If you cannot remember the difference between「effect」and「affect,」this book will not help you, and neither of its authors will ever win a spelling bee, but then no one can ever become a competent writer if we consider mastery of the indefinite list of accidentals at the surface of any language to be competence in writing. Is there any competent speaker of English anywhere who can pronounce, spell, and use every word in the OED or Webster's? Does that mean there are no competent speakers of English? What a competent writer can know perfectly are the principles of a style, and no style is an inert set of rules. Once the principles are grasped and the writer begins to use the style from a position of command, the writer becomes active in that style, and the style becomes part of the writer's active competence as surely and perfectly as word order. There is unlimited room for invention and discovery within the constraints of the style just as there is unlimited room for meaning and expression within the constraints of the word order of English, for the mastery of a style, like the underlying linguistic competence, is a living activity, not a rote performance.
